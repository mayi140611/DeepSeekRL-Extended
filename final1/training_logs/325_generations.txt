###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

91
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
In the first hour, Bob created 13 questions. In the second hour, he doubled his rate, so he created \(13 \times 2 = 26\) questions. In the third hour, he again doubled his rate, so he created \(26 \times 2 = 52\) questions. 

To find the total number of questions Bob created in the three hours, we add the number of questions created each hour:
\[13 + 26 + 52 = 91\]

In the first hour, Bob created 13 questions. In the second hour, he created double his rate, so he created \(13 \times 2 = 26\) questions. In the third hour, he doubled his second rate again, so he created \(26 \times 2 = 52\) questions. 

To find the total number of questions created in three hours, we sum the number of questions created in each hour:

\[13 + 26 + 52\]

Let's calculate the total.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####


system
To calculate the total number of questions Bob created in the three hours, we start by examining each hour:

1. In the first hour, Bob created 13 questions.
2. In the second hour, he doubled his rate from the first hour. Hence, he created \( 13 \times 2 = 26 \) questions.
3. In the third hour, he doubled his rate from the second hour. Therefore, he created \( 26 \times 2 = 52 \) questions.

To find the total, we add the questions from each hour:

\[
13 + 26 + 52 = 91
\]

Thus, the total number of questions Bob created in the three hours is 91.
