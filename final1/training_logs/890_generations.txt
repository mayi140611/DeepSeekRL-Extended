<reasoning>
Let's start by determining how many quarters are state quarters. Since 2/5 of the 35 quarters are state quarters, we calculate:
\[ \text{State quarters} = \frac{2}{5} \times 35 = \frac{70}{5} = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these state quarters are Pennsylvania ones. Since 50 percent (or 0.5) of the state quarters are Pennsylvania, we calculate:
\[ \text{Pennsylvania quarter state} = 0.5 \times 14 = 7 \]

Therefore, Nick has 7 Pennsylvania state quarters.

First, we need to find out how many of Nick's quarters are state quarters. Since 2/5 of the 35 quarters are state quarters, we calculate:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 35 = 14 \text{ state quarters}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many of these state quarters are Pennsylvania state quarters. Since 50% of the state quarters are Pennsylvania, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \text{ Pennsylvania state quarters}
\]

So, Nick has 7 Pennsylvania state quarters.

First, let's find out how many of Nick's quarters are state quarters. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the quarters are state quarters, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 35 = 14 \text{ state quarters}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these state quarters are Pennsylvania state quarters. Since 50% of the state quarters are Pennsylvania, we calculate:

\[
0.5 \times 14 = 7 \text{ Pennsylvania state quarters}
\]

Therefore, Nick has 7 Pennsylvania state quarters.

First, we need to determine how many quarters are state quarters. We know that Nick has 35 quarters in total, and two-fifths of these are state quarters. So, we calculate the number of state quarters as follows:

\[
\text{Number of state quarters} = \frac{2}{5} \times 35 = 14
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these state quarters are Pennsylvania. We know that 50% of the state quarters are Pennsylvania. So, we calculate the number of Pennsylvania state quarters as follows:

\[
\text{Number of Pennsylvania state quarters} = \frac{50}{100} \times 14 = 0.5 \times 14 = 7
\]

So, Nick has 7 Pennsylvania state quarters.

Nick has a total of 35 quarters. According to the problem, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of these quarters are state quarters, so the number of Pennsylvania state quarters Nick has is \(\frac{2}{5} \times 35 = 14\).

Here's the Python code to solve this:
```python
total_quarters = 35
fraction_state_quarters = 2 / 5

# Calculate total Pennsylvania state quarters
pennsylvania_state_quarters = total_quarters * fraction_state_quarters
pennsylvania_state_quarters

To find out how many Pennsylvania state quarters Nick has, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of state quarters Nick has. Since 2/5 of the 35 quarters are state quarters, we can find this number by calculating:
\[ \text{Number of state quarters} = \frac{2}{5} \times 35 = \frac{2 \times 35}{5} \]

2. Calculate the number of Pennsylvania state quarters by finding 50% of the state quarters:
\[ \text{Number of Pennsylvania state quarters} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of state quarters} \]

Now, let's calculate these values:
\[ \text{Number of state quarters} = \frac{2 \times 35}{5} = \frac{70}{5} = 14 \]
\[ \text{Number of Pennsylvania state quarters} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \]

Therefore, Nick has 7 Pennsylvania state quarters.
