On Wednesday, the cost of a movie ticket is twice the cost on Monday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars. On Saturday, the cost is five times the cost on Monday, which is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars. Glenn spends 10 dollars on Wednesday and 25 dollars on Saturday, totaling \(10 + 25 = 35\) dollars.
