To find out how many pregnant female cows Terez has, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female cows.
2. Calculate the number of pregnant female cows.

First, since 50 percent of the cows are female, we can calculate the number of females like this:
\[ \text{Number of female cows} = 44 \times \frac{50}{100} = 44 \times 0.5 = 22 \]

Next, since 50 percent of the females are pregnant, we can calculate the number of pregnant females like this:
\[ \text{Number of pregnant females} = 22 \times \frac{50}{100} = 22 \times 0.5 = 11 \]

So, Terez has 11 pregnant female cows.

To find the number of pregnant female cows, we first need to determine the number of female cows.

Given that 50 percent of the cows are female, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of female cows} = 50\% \times 44 = \frac{50}{100} \times 44 = 0.5 \times 44 = 22 \]

Next, since 50 percent of these female cows are pregnant, we calculate the number of pregnant female cows:
\[ \text{Number of pregnant female cows} = 50\% \times 22 = \frac{50}{100} \times 22 = 0.5 \times 22 = 11 \]

So, Terez has 11 pregnant female cows.

system
To find out how many pregnant female cows Terez has, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female cows:
   - Since 50 percent of the cows are female, we can calculate the number of female cows as 50 percent of 44.
   - Number of female cows = 50/100 * 44 = 22

2. Calculate the number of pregnant female cows:
   - Since 50 percent of the females are pregnant, we can calculate the number of pregnant female cows as 50 percent of the number of female cows.
   - Number of pregnant female cows = 50/100 * 22 = 11

So, Terez has 11 pregnant female cows.

To find the number of pregnant female cows, we first need to determine the number of female cows. Since 50 percent of the cows are female, we can calculate the number of female cows by multiplying the total number of cows by 50 percent (or 0.5).

Number of female cows = Total number of cows * Percentage of female cows
Number of female cows = 44 * 0.5
Number of female cows = 22

Now, 50 percent of the female cows are pregnant. To find the number of pregnant female cows, we multiply the number of female cows by 50 percent (or 0.5).

Number of pregnant female cows = Number of female cows * Percentage of pregnant cows
Number of pregnant female cows = 22 * 0.5
Number of pregnant female cows = 11

Therefore, Terez has 11 pregnant female cows.

To find the number of pregnant female cows, we first need to find the number of female cows on the farm, which is 50 percent of the total number of cows.

50 percent of 44 cows = (50/100) * 44 = 22 female cows

Now, since 50 percent of the female cows are pregnant, we can find the number of pregnant female cows by taking 50 percent of the 22 female cows.

50 percent of 22 female cows = (50/100) * 22 = 11 pregnant female cows

So, Terez has 11 pregnant female cows on his farm.

To find the number of pregnant female cows, we first need to determine the number of female cows, which is 50% of the total number of cows.

44 cows * 50% = 22 female cows

Now, to find the number of pregnant females, we need to know the percentage of female cows that are pregnant. We are given that 50% of the females are pregnant, so we simply take half of the number of female cows.

22 female cows * 50% = 11 pregnant female cows

Therefore, Terez has 11 pregnant female cows.

We know that Terez has 44 cows on his farm. Since 50 percent of the cows are female, we can calculate the number of female cows by multiplying the total number of cows by 50 percent (or 0.5). This gives us 44 * 0.5 = 22 female cows.

Now, 50 percent of these female cows are pregnant, which means we can calculate the number of pregnant female cows by multiplying the number of female cows by 50 percent (or 0.5). This gives us 22 * 0.5 = 11 pregnant female cows.
