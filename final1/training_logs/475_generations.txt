To find the cost of the High Jump sneakers, we need to calculate Joey's total earnings from mowing lawns, selling collectible figures, and working at his after-school job, and then compare it to the price of the sneakers, which is $8 per lawn, since he mowed 3 lawns.

First, calculate the earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 3 \text{ lawns} \times \$8 \text{ per lawn} = \$24 \]

Next, calculate the earnings from selling collectible figures:
\[ 2 \text{ figures} \times \$9 \text{ per figure} = \$18 \]

Then, calculate the earnings from his after-school job:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} \times \$5 \text{ per hour} = \$50 \]

Now, sum up all of his earnings:
\[ \$24 + \$18 + \$50 = \$92 \]

Since his earnings just cover the price of the High Jump sneakers, the cost of the sneakers is:
\[ \$92 \]
