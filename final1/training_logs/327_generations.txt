Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Andy buys 30 minks.
2. Each mink has 6 babies, so the total number of minks after the babies are born is \(30 + 30 \times 6 = 30 + 180 = 210\) minks.
3. Half of these minks are set free, so the number of minks remaining is \(210 / 2 = 105\).
4. It takes 15 mink skins to make a coat. Therefore, the number of coats that can be made is \(105 / 15 = 7\).

<reasoning>
First, let's determine how many minks Andy has initially. He buys 30 minks and each mink has 6 babies, so the total number of newborn minks is 30 * 6 = 180 minks. This gives us a total of 30 (initial) + 180 (newborns) = 210 minks.

Next, half of these minks are set free by activists, resulting in 210 / 2 = 105 minks remaining.

Finally, we need to determine how many coats can be made from 105 minks. Since it takes 15 minks to make one coat, the number of coats Andy can make is 105 / 15 = 7 coats.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of minks bought by Andy:** 30

2. **Number of newborn minks:** 30 minks * 6 newborns/mink = 180 newborns

3. **Total number of minks including newborns before any are set free:** 30 minks + 180 newborns = 210 minks

4. **Minks set free by activists:** 50% of 210 minks = 0.5 * 210 = 105 minks

5. **Number of minks remaining after 105 are set free:** 210 minks - 105 minks = 105 minks

6. **Total number of minks (including the original bought and the newborns set free): 105 minks**

7. **Number of mink skins needed to make one coat:** 15 minks/skin

8. **Number of coats Andy can make:** 105 minks / 15 minks/skin = 7 coats

So, Andy can make 7 coats.

To make a coat we need 15 minks skins so 30 minks is 2 coats. With each mink having 6 babies there are 180 minks, so 180/2= 90 minks are freed. 90/15=minks can make a coat.

Let's calculate the number of minks Andy has after accounting for the babies and those set free by activists.

Initially, Andy buys 30 minks.

Each mink has 6 babies, so from the 30 minks, Andy gets 30 * 6 = 180 baby minks.

So the total number of minks after the babies are born is 30 (initial) + 180 (babies) = 210 minks.

Half of these minks are set free by activists, so the number left is 210 * 0.5 = 105 minks.

Each coat requires 15 mink skins, so the number of coats Andy can make is 105 / 15 = 7 coats.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of minks**: Andy buys 30 minks.
2. **Egg production**: Each mink produces 6 babies, so the total number of newborn minks is \(30 \times 6 = 180\).
3. **Total minks before setting free**: The total number of minks before setting any free is \(30 + 180 = 210\).
4. **Setting some free**: Half of the total minks are set free by activists, so the number of minks set free is \( \frac{210}{2} = 105 \).
5. **Total minks available**: The total number of minks available is \(210 - 105 = 105\).

Given that it takes 15 mink skins to make a coat, we can now calculate how many coats Andy can make:
- Number of coats he can make = \( \frac{105}{15} = 7 \).

**Reasoning**:
First, we summed up the total number of minks produced by the bought minks and their babies. Then, we calculated how many of these minks were set free by activists, leaving us with the total minks. Finally, we divided the total minks by the number required for one coat to find out how many coats Andy can make with the available skins.

We need to calculate the total number of mink skins Andy has and then determine how many coats can be made with those skins.

1. Andy buys 30 minks.
2. Each mink has 6 babies, so the total number of new minks is \(30 \times 6 = 180\).
3. Adding the bought minks and the new ones gives \(30 + 180 = 210\) minks in total.
4. Half of the total minks are set free by activists, so \( \frac{210}{2} = 105 \) minks are set free.

To determine how many coats Andy can make, we need to calculate the total number of minks he has after accounting for the babies and the ones set free by activists, and then divide that number by the number of mink skins needed for one coat.

First, calculate the total number of minks Andy initially has:
\[ 30 \text{ minks} + 30 \text{ babies} \times 6 = 30 + 180 = 210 \text{ minks} \]

Next, determine how many minks are set free by activists, which is half of the total:
\[ \frac{210}{2} = 105 \text{ minks} \]

Subtract the number of minks set free from the total:
\[ 210 - 105 = 105 \text{ minks} \]

Now, divide the remaining minks by the number of minks needed for one coat:
\[ \frac{105}{15} = 7 \]

Therefore, Andy can make 7 coats.

To determine how many coats Andy can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minks Andy buys: \(30 \text{ minks} \times 6 \text{ babies per mink} = 180 \text{ minks}\).
2. Calculate the number of minks that are set free by activists: \(180 \text{ minks} \times \frac{1}{2} = 90 \text{ minks}\).
3. Calculate the total number of minks Andy has after accounting for the minks set free: \(180 \text{ minks} - 90 \text{ minks} = 90 \text{ minks}\).

Since it takes 15 mink skins to make a coat, we can now calculate the number of coats Andy can make:

First, we calculate the total number of minks Andy has, which is his initial 30 minks plus the additional 30 minks they gave him, amounting to 60 minks. Each mink has 6 babies, so we find the total number of baby minks by multiplying the number of minks by the number of babies per mink:
\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ baby minks} \]

Adding the initial minks to the baby minks gives us the total number of minks:
\[ 30 + 360 = 390 \text{ total minks} \]

Half of the total minks are set free, so the number of minks that remain is:
\[ 390 / 2 = 195 \text{ minks} \]

Since it takes 15 mink skins to make one coat, we divide the number of remaining minks by 15 to find out how many coats Andy can make:
\[ 195 / 15 = 13 \text{ coats} \]

First, we need to calculate the total number of minks Andy has after the births and before setting any free. Andy buys 30 minks and each mink has 6 babies, so the total number of new minks is \(30 \times 6 = 180\). Adding these to the initial 30 minks gives us \(30 + 180 = 210\) minks in total.

However, half of these minks are set free by activists. So, the number of minks set free is \(210 \div 2 = 105\). Subtracting these minks from the total gives us \(210 - 105 = 105\) minks left that can be used to make coats.

Given that it takes 15 mink skins to make one coat, the number of coats Andy can make is \(105 \div 15 = 7\) coats.

To determine how many coats Andy can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of minks after the birth of the babies:**
   - Andy starts with 30 minks.
   - Each mink gives birth to 6 babies.
   - Total number of minks at birth = \( 30 + 30 \times 6 = 30 + 180 = 210 \) minks.

2. **Account for the minks set free by activists:**
   - Half of the total minks are set free.
   - Number of minks set free = \( \frac{210}{2} = 105 \) minks.

3. **Calculate the number of minks that are left:**
   - Number of minks left = Total minks at birth - Minks set free
   - Number of minks left = \( 210 - 105 = 105 \) minks.

4. **Determine how many coats Andy can make:**
   - It takes 15 mink skins to make one coat.
   - Number of coats = Number of minks left / 15
   - Number of coats = \( \frac{105}{15} = 7 \) coats.

Therefore, Andy can make 7 coats.
