###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A laboratory has 22 beakers of liquid in a fume hood, and 8 of the beakers have copper ions in them. Adding three drops of a solution will turn the liquid in a beaker blue if there are copper ions present. If the beakers are tested one by one for copper ions and 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found, how many beakers without copper ions were tested?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
The total number of drops used is 45. Since adding three drops turns a liquid blue, the number of beakers with copper ions that were found is 45/3 = 15.
There are a total of 8 beakers with copper ions, so 15 - 8 = 7 beakers with copper ions were not tested.
There were originally 22 beakers, and 7 were not tested, so 22 - 7 = 15 beakers with copper ions were tested.

system
Initially, there are 8 beakers with copper ions and 22 - 8 = 14 beakers without copper ions.

If 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found, this means that at the first instance where a beaker has copper ions, 45 drops have been used. Each beaker with copper ions requires 3 drops, so there must have been at least $45 \div 3 = 15$ beakers with copper ions that have not been tested yet.

Since 8 beakers with copper ions are already found, there are $15 - 8 = 7$ beakers with copper ions that have not been tested yet.

Therefore, at least 14 - 7 = 7 beakers without copper ions were tested.

The beakers with copper ions were tested until 45 drops were used. Since 3 drops are used per beaker, the 8 beakers with copper ions were tested \( \frac{45}{3} = 15 \) times. This means that 15 beakers with copper ions were tested.

The total number of beakers tested is equal to the total number of drops used, which is 45. Therefore, the number of beakers without copper ions that were tested is \( 45 - 15 = 30 \).

After testing 8 of the beakers, 45 drops were used, which means 42 drops were needed to test the remaining beakers. The beakers without copper ions were tested using 47 drops, but 45 were used to test the beakers with copper ions. So, the number of beakers without copper ions that were tested is 47 - 45 = 2 beakers.

The beakers are tested one by one, and after 45 drops the 8 beakers with copper ions are found. Each beaker tested uses 3 drops. Therefore, 45 drops divided by 3 drops per beaker tested equals 15 beakers that had been tested before finding all the beakers with copper ions. 22 beakers total minus 8 beakers with copper ions equals 14 beakers without copper ions that have been tested.

First, calculate the total number of beakers tested in the 45 drops: 45 drops / 3 drops per beaker = 15 beakers tested.

Then, calculate the number of beakers with copper ions among the 15 tested: 15 beakers tested * 8 beakers with copper ions = 120 beakers with copper ions.

Now find the number of beakers without copper ions among the 15 tested:
15 beakers tested - 120 beakers with copper ions = 3 beakers without copper ions.

1. **Determine total number of tests and tests with copper ions:**
   - Total number of beakers: 22
   - Number of beakers with copper ions: 8
   - Number of drops used: 45

2. **Calculate the number of tests conducted before all beakers with copper ions are found:**
   Since all 8 beakers with copper ions are found by the time 45 drops are used, it implies that these 8 beakers are among the first 8 tests plus some additional tests. Let \( T_p \) be the number of additional tests (excluding the initial 8) needed to find all 8 beakers with copper ions.

3. **Express the total number of tests used:**
   The total number of tests used is \( T_p + 8 \).

4. **Set up the equation based on the total number of drops used:**
   Each beaker tested (including those with and without copper ions) uses 3 drops. Therefore, the total number of drops used is:
   \[
   3 \times (T_p + 8) = 45
   \]

5. **Solve for \( T_p \):**
   \[
   3 \times (T_p + 8) = 45
   \]
   \[
   T_p + 8 = \frac{45}{3}
   \]
   \[
   T_p + 8 = 15
   \]
   \[
   T_p = 15 - 8
   \]
   \[
   T_p = 7
   \]

6. **Determine the number of tests conducted on beakers without copper ions:**
   Since \( T_p = 7 \), the number of tests conducted on beakers without copper ions (excluding the initial 8) is 7.

7. **Calculate the total number of beakers tested on beakers without copper ions:**
   \[
   22 - 8 = 14
   \]

8. **Add the initial 8 tests:**
   \[
   8 + 7 = 15
   \]

Therefore, the number of beakers without copper ions tested is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]

All 8 beakers with copper ions were tested, and it took 45 drops. Since adding three drops will turn the liquid in a beaker blue if there are copper ions present, then the remaining drops will be used for the beakers without copper ions.

There were 22 beakers in total, and 8 of them were tested (8 beakers with copper ions), leaving 14 beakers without copper ions to be tested. 

Since 45 drops were used, and 3 drops are used for each beaker with copper ions, 3 beakers with copper ions were tested.

This means the beakers without copper ions that were tested were 14 - 3 = 11 beakers.

The total number of beakers is 22, of which 8 have copper ions. This means there are \(22 - 8 = 14\) beakers without copper ions. Since adding drops to a beaker that has copper ions makes it blue, and using 3 drops to check each beaker, 45 drops used means 45/3 = 15 beakers tested. 

So, if 15 beakers were tested out of 22 total, the number of beakers without copper ions tested is \(15 - 8 = 7\).

Each beaker that has copper ions is tested with 3 drops, and 45 drops were used before all 8 beakers with copper ions were found. Therefore, 15 beakers with copper ions were tested (45 drops / 3 drops/bearer = 15 beakers).

The total number of beakers was 22, and 8 beakers had copper ions, so 14 beakers did not have copper ions. Since 15 beakers were tested with copper ions, it means that the 15 beakers tested with copper ions made up part of the 14 beakers without copper ions that were also tested, plus an additional beaker if the last beaker without copper ions was tested with the 15th drop.

To find out how many beakers without copper ions were tested, let's subtract the number of beakers with copper ions from the total number of beakers and then add the 45 drops of solution that were used before finding all the beakers with copper ions:

\( 14 \text{ beakers without copper ions} + 3 \text{ beakers with copper ions} = 17 \text{ beakers} \)

Since 45 drops were used, and each beaker that has copper ions takes 3 drops, we can find out how many beakers with copper ions were tested by dividing the total number of drops by the drops per beaker:

\( 45 \text{ drops} / 3 \text{ drops/beaker} = 15 \text{ beakers with copper ions} \)

The 15 beakers with copper ions were already mentioned, so we need to add one more beaker to account for the last beaker without copper ions tested:

\( 14 \text{ beakers without copper ions} + 1 = 15 \text{ beakers tested without copper ions} \)

The laboratory used 45 drops in total, and each beaker being tested is tested using exactly 3 drops. Hence, the number of beakers tested is \( \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).
