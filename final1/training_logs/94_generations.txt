system
To find out how long it will take John to write 3 books that are 400 pages each, we first need to calculate the total number of pages John needs to write.

First, we calculate the total pages for 3 books:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 3 \times 400 \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 1200 \]

Given that John writes 20 pages a day, we now need to find out how many days it would take him to write 1200 pages.

To find this, we divide the total pages by the number of pages he writes per day:
\[ \text{Days} = \frac{1200}{20} \]

\[ \text{Days} = 60 \]

Therefore, it will take John 60 days to write 3 books, each of 400 pages, given that he writes 20 pages a day.

To find out how long it will take John to write 3 books that are 400 pages each, we first determine the total number of pages he needs to write. Since each book is 400 pages and he has 3 books, we multiply 400 by 3.

\[ \text{Total pages} = 400 \text{ pages/book} \times 3 \text{ books} = 1200 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we know that John writes 20 pages a day. To find out how many days it will take him to write 1200 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he writes per day.

\[ \text{Days required} = \frac{1200 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ pages/day}} = 60 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take John 60 days to write 3 books that are 400 pages each.

John writes 20 pages a day.

Each book is 400 pages.
So, the total pages for 3 books = 400 pages/book x 3 books = 1200 pages.

To find out how long it will take him to write 1200 pages if he writes 20 pages a day, we calculate:

1200 pages รท 20 pages/day = 60 days.

Therefore, it will take him 60 days to write 3 books that are 400 pages each.

To find out how long it will take John to write 3 books that are 400 pages each, we first calculate the total number of pages he needs to write. 

Each book is 400 pages, and there are 3 books, so the total number of pages is:
\[ 400 \text{ pages/book} \times 3 \text{ books} = 1200 \text{ pages} \]

John writes 20 pages a day, so to find out how many days it will take to write 1200 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he writes per day:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ pages/day}} = 60 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take John 60 days to write 3 books that are 400 pages each.

To determine how long it will take John to write 3 books that are 400 pages each, we need to know how many pages he writes in total and then divide that by the number of pages he writes in a day.

1. First, calculate the total number of pages John needs to write. Since each book is 400 pages and he has 3 books, we multiply 400 by 3:
\[
400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ pages}
\]

2. Next, we need to determine how long it will take John to write 1200 pages if he writes 20 pages per day. We do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he writes per day:
\[
1200 \div 20 = 60 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, it will take John 60 days to write 3 books that are 400 pages each.
