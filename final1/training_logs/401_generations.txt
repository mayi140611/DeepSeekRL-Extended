###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A new movie gets released and makes $120 million in the box office for its opening weekend.  It ends up making 3.5 times that much during its entire run.  If the production company gets to keep 60%, how much profit did they make if the movie cost $60 million to produce?

system
The movie made $120 million x 3.5 = $420 million during its entire run.
So, the production company got $420 million x 0.6 = $252 million.

Therefore, the profit made was $252 - $60 = $192 million.

To calculate the production company's profit, we first need to determine the total revenue from the movie's entire run. The movie made $120 million in the opening weekend and $3.5 times that during its entire run, which is $120 million * 3.5 = $420 million.

The production company gets to keep 60% of these revenues, which is $420 million * 0.60 = $252 million.

The movie cost $60 million to produce. Therefore, the profit is the amount the production company keeps minus the movie cost, which is $252 million - $60 million = $192 million.

To determine the profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the movie and then subtract the production cost.

1. Calculate the total revenue from the movie:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 3.5 \times 120 = 420 \text{ million dollars} \]

2. Calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Production Cost} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 420 - 60 = 360 \text{ million dollars} \]

3. Calculate the profit as a percentage of total revenue, given that the production company gets to keep 60%:
\[ \text{Profit as a percentage of total revenue} = \frac{\text{Production Cost}}{\text{Total Revenue}} \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Profit as a percentage of total revenue} = \frac{60}{420} \times 100 \approx 14.29\% \]

The movie made $120 million x 3.5 = $420 million during its entire run.
If the production company keeps 60% of the revenue, they received a profit of $420 million x 60% = $252 million.
The profit the production company made is $252 million - $60 million = $192 million.

Initially, the movie makes $120 million in the opening weekend. It then makes 3.5 times that much during its entire run, which is calculated as follows: $120 million * 3.5 = $420 million.

The production cost for the movie is $60 million. The gross income from the entire run is $420 million, so the total revenue from ticket sales is the gross income plus the production cost: $420 million + $60 million = $480 million.

The production company gets to keep 60% of the total revenue, so the amount the production company keeps is 0.60 * $480 million = $288 million.

To find the profit, we subtract the production cost from the amount the production company receives from the total revenue: $288 million - $60 million = $228 million.

The movie made an additional amount of \( 3.5 \times 120 \) million dollars during its entire run.

\[ \text{Additional revenue} = 3.5 \times 120 = 420 \, \text{million dollars} \]

Total revenues from the movie is \( 120 + 420 = 540 \) million dollars.

The production company keeps 60%, then they keep:

\[ 540 \times 0.60 = 324 \, \text{million dollars} \]

Subtracting the production cost (\$60 million), the profit is \( 324 - 60 = 264 \) million dollars.

The movie makes $120 million in the opening weekend, and 3.5 times that amount is $420 million. So the entire run is $420 + $120 = $540 million. The production company sells 60% of 540, which is $324 million. So they made a profit of $324 - $60 = $264 million.

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total earnings of the movie during its entire run. The movie made $120 million in its opening weekend and 3.5 times that much during its entire run.

Total earnings = Opening weekend earnings * Number of times the earnings are 3.5 times
Total earnings = $120 million * 3.5
Total earnings = $420 million

Next, we need to find out what percentage of these earnings go to the production company. Since they get to keep 60%, we multiply the total earnings by 0.60.

Profit = Total earnings * Percentage kept by the production company
Profit = $420 million * 0.60
Profit = $252 million

The production company made a profit of $252 million.

To determine the profit, we need to calculate the total box office revenue and then multiply it by the production company's profit percentage from the production cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total box office revenue.
The movie made $120 million in the opening weekend and 3.5 times that much during its entire run.
\[ \text{Total box office revenue} = 120 \text{ million} \times 3.5 = 420 \text{ million} \]

Step 2: Calculate the profit.
The production company keeps 60% of the total box office revenue.
\[ \text{Profit} = 420 \text{ million} \times 0.60 = 252 \text{ million} \]

Step 3: Calculate the profit percentage.
The production cost for the movie was $60 million.
\[ \text{Profit percentage} = \frac{252 \text{ million}}{60 \text{ million}} \times 100\% = 420\% \]

So, the profit the production company made is $252 million, representing a profit percentage of 420%.

To determine the profit, we first need to calculate the total box office revenue. The movie made $120 million in the first weekend and 3.5 times that much during its entire run. 

\[
\text{Total box office revenue} = 120 \, \text{million} \times 3.5 = 420 \, \text{million}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much the production company received by keeping 60% of the total box office revenue.

\[
\text{Amount received by the production company} = 420 \, \text{million} \times 0.60 = 252 \, \text{million}

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the production cost from the amount received by the production company.
