###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

There are 6 people going on an airplane trip.  They each have 5 bags of luggage.  Each of their bags weighs the maximum weight allowed, 50 pounds.  The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds.  How many more bags at maximum weight can the plane hold?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
The total weight of the luggage each person is carrying is 5 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 250 pounds/person.
With 6 people, the total weight of luggage for everyone is 6 people * 250 pounds/person = 1500 pounds.
The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds, so the plane can hold an additional 6000 pounds - 1500 pounds = 4500 pounds.
Since each bag weighs 50 pounds, the plane can hold 4500 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 90 more bags.

The total weight of the luggage that the 6 people can carry is \(6 \times 5 \times 50 = 1500\) pounds. The plane can hold 6000 pounds in total. The remaining weight the plane can hold is \(6000 - 1500 = 4500\) pounds. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds, the number of additional bags the plane can hold is \(4500 / 50 = 90\).

The total weight of the luggage is calculated as follows:

6 people * 5 bags/person * 50 pounds/bag = 1500 pounds

The airplane can hold a total of 6000 pounds, so the remaining capacity is:

6000 pounds - 1500 pounds = 4500 pounds

Each bag weighs 50 pounds, so the number of additional bags the plane can hold is:

4500 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 90 bags

To determine how many more bags the plane can hold, first calculate the total weight of the luggage the 6 people already have:

1. Each person has 5 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds.
2. So, each person has \(5 \times 50 = 250\) pounds of luggage.
3. There are 6 people, so the total luggage weight initially is \(6 \times 250 = 1500\) pounds.

The airplane's total luggage capacity is 6000 pounds. Therefore, the remaining capacity for luggage is:

4. \(6000 - 1500 = 4500\) pounds.

Since each bag weighs 50 pounds, the number of additional bags the plane can hold is:

5. \(4500 \div 50 = 90\).

So, the plane can hold 90 more bags at maximum weight.

Each person has 5 bags and each bag weighs 50 pounds, so each person's luggage weighs 5 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 250 pounds.

With 6 people, the total luggage weight would be 6 people * 250 pounds/person = 1500 pounds.

The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds, so the remaining capacity is 6000 pounds - 1500 pounds = 4500 pounds.

Since each bag weighs 50 pounds, the number of additional bags the plane can hold is 4500 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 90 bags.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each of the 6 people has 5 bags of luggage.
2. Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
3. Therefore, the total weight of luggage for each person is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) pounds.
4. For all 6 people, the total luggage weight is \(6 \times 250 = 1500\) pounds.
5. The airplane's total luggage capacity is 6000 pounds.
6. The remaining luggage capacity that can be added to the airplane is \(6000 - 1500 = 4500\) pounds.

The question asks how many more bags at maximum weight the plane can hold. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds, we divide the remaining capacity by the weight of one bag:
\[4500 \div 50 = 90\]

Therefore, the plane can hold 90 more bags at maximum weight.

To determine how many more bags at maximum weight the plane can hold, let's break down the problem:

1. Calculate the total luggage weight for all 6 people:
   - Each person has 5 bags.
   - Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
   - Total bags per person = 5 bags.
   - Total bags for 6 people = 6 × 5 = 30 bags.

2. Calculate the total luggage weight for all 30 bags:
   - Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
   - Total weight for 30 bags = 30 × 50 = 1500 pounds.

3. Determine the remaining luggage capacity of the airplane:
   - Total luggage capacity of the airplane = 6000 pounds.
   - Remaining capacity = Total capacity - Total luggage weight.
   - Remaining capacity = 6000 - 1500 = 4500 pounds.

4. Calculate how many more bags can be added with the remaining capacity:
   - Each additional bag weighs 50 pounds.
   - Number of additional bags = Remaining capacity / Weight per bag.
   - Number of additional bags = 4500 / 50 = 90 bags.

Hence, the plane can hold 90 more bags at maximum weight.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the luggage that the 6 people are bringing. Each bag weighs 50 pounds, and there are 6 people.

\[
\text{Total weight of luggage} = 6 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bags/person} \times 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 1500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds. To find out how many more pounds the airplane can hold, we subtract the total weight of the luggage the passengers are bringing from the airplane's maximum carrying capacity.

\[
\text{Remaining capacity} = 6000 \text{ pounds} - 1500 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since each bag weighs 50 pounds, to find out how many more bags can be added to the plane, we divide the remaining capacity by the weight of each bag.

\[
\text{Number of additional bags} = \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 90 \text{ bags}
\]

To determine how many more bags at maximum weight the plane can hold, we need to first calculate the total weight of the luggage already on the plane and then find out how much more weight the plane can hold.

1. Calculate the total weight of the luggage already on the plane.
   Each person has 5 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds.
   Therefore, the total weight for each person is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) pounds.
   Since there are 6 people, the total weight of the luggage is \(6 \times 250 = 1500\) pounds.

2. Determine how much more weight the plane can hold.
   The plane can hold a total of 6000 pounds.
   The remaining weight capacity is \(6000 - 1500 = 4500\) pounds.

3. Calculate how many more bags at maximum weight the plane can hold.
   Each additional bag weighs 50 pounds, so the number of additional bags that can be carried is \(4500 \div 50 = 90\).

Thus, the plane can hold 90 more bags at the maximum weight.

To determine how many more bags the plane can hold at maximum weight, we need to calculate the total weight of the luggage currently on the plane and then find out how much additional weight the plane can still hold.

First, calculate the total number of bags on the plane:
\[ 6 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bags per person} = 30 \text{ bags} \]

Next, calculate the total weight of these 30 bags:
\[ 30 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 1500 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, determine how much more weight the plane can hold:
\[ 6000 \text{ pounds} - 1500 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each bag weighs 50 pounds, the number of additional bags the plane can hold is:
\[ \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds per bag}} = 90 \text{ bags} \]

So, the plane can hold 90 more bags at maximum weight.

To determine how many more bags at the maximum weight the plane can hold, we first need to calculate the total weight of the luggage already on the plane.

Each person has 5 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, each person's luggage weighs:
\[5 \text{ bags/person} \times 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 250 \text{ pounds/person}\]

Since there are 6 people, the total weight of the luggage is:
\[6 \text{ people} \times 250 \text{ pounds/person} = 1500 \text{ pounds}\]

The airplane can hold a total of 6000 pounds of luggage. After accounting for the 1500 pounds already on the plane, the remaining capacity is:
\[6000 \text{ pounds} - 1500 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds}\]

Since each bag still weighs 50 pounds, the number of additional bags the plane can hold is:
\[4500 \text{ pounds} \div 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 90 \text{ bags}\]

Therefore, the airplane can hold 90 more bags at their maximum weight.
