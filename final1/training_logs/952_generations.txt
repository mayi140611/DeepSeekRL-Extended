#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
The grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes. Each bag contains 60 coals, so a total of \(3 \times 60 = 180\) coals were burned. Since the grill burns fifteen coals every twenty minutes, for 180 coals, it will take \(180 \div 15 = 12\) sets of twenty minutes to burn all the coals. Therefore, the grill ran for \(12 \times 20 = 240\) minutes, or 4 hours.

The grill burns fifteen coals per twenty minutes. Each bag contains sixty coals, which means three bags contain \(3 \times 60 = 180\) coals.

To find out how long the grill ran, we first need to determine how long it took to burn all 180 coals. Since the grill burns fifteen coals per twenty minutes, it would take \(180 \div 15 = 12\) sets of twenty minutes to burn all the coals.

\(12 \times 20 = 240\) minutes.

Therefore, the grill ran for 240 minutes or 4 hours.

Each bag of coal contains 60 coals, so three bags contain \(3 \times 60 = 180\) coals. The grill burns fifteen coals every twenty minutes. To find out how long the grill runs, we need to determine how many sets of fifteen coals are in 180 coals. We divide 180 by 15 to get the number of twenty-minute intervals, which is \(180 \div 15 = 12\) intervals. Since each interval is twenty minutes long, the total time the grill ran is \(12 \times 20 = 240\) minutes. Therefore, the grill ran for 240 minutes or 4 hours.

To determine how long the grill ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of coals burned.
2. Determine how long the grill burns for a given number of coals.

First, each bag contains 60 coals, and there are three bags, so the total number of coals is:
\[ 60 \text{ coals/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 180 \text{ coals} \]

Next, the grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes. To find out how long the grill runs for a total of 180 coals, we divide the total number of coals by the number of coals burned per twenty minutes:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ coals}}{15 \text{ coals/20 minutes}} = 12 \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the grill ran for 240 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of coals burned and the total time they burned.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of coals burned:
   Each bag contains 60 coals, and there were three bags.
   Total coals burned = 60 coals/bag * 3 bags = 180 coals

2. The grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes. So, to burn 180 coals, we need to find out how many 20-minute intervals are in 180 coals.

   Coals burned = 15 coals/interval
   Therefore, the total time in minutes = 180 coals / 15 coals/interval = 12 intervals

   Since each interval is 20 minutes, the total time the grill ran is:
   Total time = 12 intervals * 20 minutes/interval = 240 minutes

   Now, let's convert this total time into hours:
   Total time in hours = Total time in minutes / 60 = 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Thus, the grill ran for 4 hours.

To determine how long the grill ran, we first need to calculate the total number of coals burned. Each bag contains 60 coals, and there are three bags, so the total number of coals is:
\[ 60 \text{ coals/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 180 \text{ coals} \]

Next, we know that the grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes. Therefore, to find out how long it took to burn all 180 coals, we can use the ratio of coals burned per unit time:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ coals}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{180 \text{ coals}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180 \times 20}{15} \]
\[ x = 320 \]

So, the grill ran for 320 minutes.

The grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes. Since a bag contains 60 coals, each bag contains 4 sets of 15 coals because \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \).

If one bag burns for 20 minutes, then 4 bags will burn for \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) minutes.

Thus, the grill ran for 80 minutes to burn through three bags of coals.

To determine how long the grill ran, we first need to understand the rate at which the coals are burned. The grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes. 

Each bag contains 60 coals. Therefore, three bags would contain:
\[ 60 \text{ coals/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 180 \text{ coals} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to burn 180 coals at the rate of fifteen coals burning every twenty minutes. We can set up the following proportion:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ coals}}{15 \text{ coals}} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/coals}} \]

Simplifying the proportion:
\[ \frac{180}{15} = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ 12 = 6 \]

The proportion is consistent, confirming the rate and total coal consumption. Therefore, the grill ran for 120 minutes.

First, we need to determine the total number of coals burned. Since each bag contains 60 coals and three bags were used, the total number of coals is:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 60 \text{ coals per bag} = 180 \text{ coals} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of twenty minutes are in the total time it took to burn all the coals. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of coals by the rate at which the coals burn:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ coals}}{15 \text{ coals per twenty minutes}} = 12 \text{ sets of twenty minutes} \]

Each set of twenty minutes equates to twenty minutes, so the total time the grill ran is:
\[ 12 \text{ sets} \times 20 \text{ minutes per set} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert minutes into hours:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the grill ran for 4 hours.

The grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes. Each bag contains 60 coals, so 3 bags contain \(3 \times 60 = 180\) coals. The grill burns 180 coals in total. Since it burns 15 coals every 20 minutes, it burns the 180 coals over \( \frac{180}{15} = 12 \) sessions of 20 minutes each. 

So, the grill runs for 12 sessions of 20 minutes each, which totals \( 12 \times 20 = 240 \) minutes.

To determine how long the grill ran, we need to calculate the total number of coals burned and then figure out how long it takes to burn that many coals.

First, calculate the total number of coals: \(3 \text{ bags} \times 60 \text{ coals/bag} = 180 \text{ coals}\).

Next, determine the rate at which coals are burned: 15 coals for every 20 minutes.

We can find how long it takes to burn 180 coals by dividing the total number of coals by the rate:
\[
\frac{180 \text{ coals}}{15 \text{ coals/20 minutes}} = 120 \text{ minutes}.

To determine how long the grill ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of coals burned.
2. Determine the burning rate of coals.
3. Use the given information to find the total time.

The grill burned three bags of coal, and each bag contains 60 coals. So, the total number of coals burned is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) coals.

The grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coal burning is \(15 \text{ coals} / 20 \text{ minutes} = 0.75 \text{ coals per minute}\).

Since we need to find out how long it took to burn 180 coals at a rate of 0.75 coals per minute, we can calculate the total time required as follows:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{180 \text{ coals}}{0.75 \text{ coals per minute}} = 240 \text{ minutes}
