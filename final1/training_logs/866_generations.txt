###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Matthew, the baker, arrives at work early every morning to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes for the day.  It usually takes Matthew 1 hour to assemble ingredients, 1.5 hours to bake the cakes, and another 1 hour to decorate each cake with cinnamon sprinkles.  One day, Matthew's oven failed to reach the correct temperature and it took twice as long for the cakes to bake as they usually take.  On that day, how long did it take, in hours, for Matthew to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes?

To determine the total time Matthew took to make his caramel-apple coffee cakes on the day the oven failed, we need to calculate the baking time in that particular day and then add the usual times for assembly and decoration.

1. **Assembling Ingredients**: Matthew takes 1 hour to assemble the ingredients.
2. **Baking the Cakes on a Regular Day**: It normally takes 1.5 hours to bake the cakes. On the day of failure, the baking time was doubled, so it took \(1.5 \times 2 = 3\) hours to bake the cakes.
3. **Decorating Each Cake**: Matthew takes 1 hour to decorate each cake.

The total time on a normal day:
\[ 1 \text{ hour (assembling)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (baking)} + 1 \text{ hour (decorating)} = 3.5 \text{ hours} \]

On the day the oven failed, the baking time was:
\[ 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding up the times for that day:
\[ 1 \text{ hour (assembling)} + 3 \text{ hours (baking)} + 1 \text{ hour (decorating)} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, on the day the oven failed, it took Matthew 5 hours to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Matthew takes on a normal day and compare it to the day when the oven failed to reach the correct temperature.

On a normal day:
- Matthew spends 1 hour assembly.
- Matthew spends 1.5 hours baking.
- Matthew spends 1 hour decorating.
- Therefore, a normal day's total time is \(1 + 1.5 + 1 = 3.5\) hours.

On the day when the oven failed, the baking time doubled to \(1.5 \times 2 = 3\) hours.

So, adding the extra baking time:
- Total time on that special day is \(3 (assembly) + 3 (double baking) + 1 (decorating) = 7\) hours.

To determine how long it took Matthew to make his caramel-apple coffee cakes on the day his oven failed, we need to break down the process and account for the extended baking time due to the faulty oven.

1. **Assembling Ingredients:** This step always takes 1 hour.
2. **Baking Time:** The original baking time is given as 1.5 hours.
3. **Decorating:** This step always takes 1 hour.

On the day of the failure, the baking time was doubled since the oven took twice as long to reach the correct temperature. Therefore, the baking time was \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 3 \text{ hours}\).

Adding up all the time taken on that day:
- Assembling ingredients: 1 hour
- Baking time: 3 hours
- Decorating: 1 hour

Total time = 1 hour + 3 hours + 1 hour = 5 hours.

Thus, it took Matthew 5 hours to make his caramel-apple coffee cakes on the day of the oven failure.

To determine the total time Matthew took to make the cakes on the day when the oven failed, we need to consider the additional time due to the oven failure.

First, we calculate the total usual time Matthew took without any issues:
- Assembly time: 1 hour
- Baking time: 1.5 hours
- Decoration time: 1 hour

Total usual time = 1 hour + 1.5 hours + 1 hour = 3.5 hours

On the day when the oven failed, the baking time doubled:
- Normal baking time: 1.5 hours
- Failed baking time: 1.5 hours * 2 = 3 hours

Now we add up the time taken on the day with the oven failure:
- Assembly time: 1 hour
- Failed baking time: 3 hours
- Decoration time: 1 hour

Total time on the day with the oven failure = 1 hour + 3 hours + 1 hour = 5 hours

Therefore, the total time it took Matthew to make the cakes on that day is 5 hours.

First, we need to determine the regular time it takes for Matthew to make each part of the process:

- Assembling ingredients: 1 hour
- Baking the cakes: 1.5 hours
- Decorating each cake: 1 hour

Multiplying these times together gives the regular total:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3.5 \text{ hours} \]

However, on the day in question, Matthew's oven failed and the cakes took twice as long to bake as usual. Since it took 1.5 hours to bake in the regular scenario, when the oven malfunctioned, it took:
\[ 2 \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
to bake.

Now, combining the regular time with the baking time on the problematic day, we get:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 3 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it took Matthew 5 hours to make his caramel-apple coffee cakes on that day.

First, we need to determine the regular time it takes Matthew to make the cakes. This includes assembling ingredients (1 hour), baking the cakes (1.5 hours), and decorating each cake with cinnamon sprinkles (1 hour). Adding these times together, we get:

1 hour (assembly) + 1.5 hours (baking) + 1 hour (decorating) = 3.5 hours

On the day Matthew's oven failed, the baking time increased to twice the regular time. So, the baking time is:

2 * 1.5 hours = 3 hours

We now add the time for assembly, the extended baking time, and decorating:

3.5 hours (regular baking time) + 3 hours (extended baking time) + 1 hour (decorating) = 7.5 hours

Therefore, it took Matthew 7.5 hours to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes on that day.

To determine the total time it took Matthew to make his caramel-apple coffee cakes on the day his oven malfunctioned, we need to account for the additional time it took for baking due to the malfunction. Here's the breakdown:

1. The usual time to assemble ingredients is 1 hour.
2. The usual time to bake the cakes is 1.5 hours.
3. The usual time to decorate each cake with cinnamon sprinkles is 1 hour.
4. Since the oven's problem doubled the time it takes to bake the cakes, the baking time becomes \(1.5 \times 2 = 3\) hours.

Adding all these times together, the total time taken on the malfunctioned day is:
\[ \text{Assembling ingredients} = 1 \text{ hour} \]
\[ \text{Baking} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Decorating cakes} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the total time is:
\[ 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time taken to make the cakes on that day is \(5\) hours.

First, let's determine the usual time it takes Matthew to make the caramel-apple coffee cakes. Matthew spends 1 hour assembling ingredients, 1.5 hours baking, and 1 hour decorating.

\[
1 \text{ (assembly)} + 1.5 \text{ (baking)} + 1 \text{ (decorating)} = 3.5 \text{ hours}
\]

On the day when the oven failed, it took twice as long to bake the cakes. Since the baking time is 1.5 hours normally, it takes:

\[
2 \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Including the other components of the usual baking time (assembly and decorating), the total baking time for that day becomes:

\[
3.5 \text{ hours usual time} + 3 \text{ hours actual baking} = 6.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Then, we add the 1 hour needed for decorating:

\[
6.5 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour of decoration} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, on this day, it took Matthew 7.5 hours to make the cakes.

First, let's determine the normal baking time for Matthew. According to the problem, the normal baking time is 1.5 hours. However, since the oven failed to reach the correct temperature, the cakes baked twice as long as usual. Therefore, the baking time would be:

\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it took on the day the oven failed. This includes the time to assemble ingredients (1 hour), the normal baking time (1.5 hours), and the doubled baking time (3 hours). Adding these together, we get:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

To determine the total time it takes for Matthew to make his caramel-apple coffee cakes on the day the oven failed, we need to account for the extended baking time.

1. The usual total time to make the cakes is composed of:
   - 1 hour to assemble ingredients
   - 1.5 hours to bake the cakes
   - 1 hour to decorate the cakes

   Total time for assembly: 1 hour
   Total time for baking: 1.5 hours
   Total time for decoration: 1 hour

   So, the usual total time is:
   \( 1 + 1.5 + 1 = 3.5 \) hours

2. On the day the oven failed, the baking time took twice as long as usual:
   Usual baking time: 1.5 hours
   Extended baking time: \( 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \) hours

3. So, the total time on that day is:
   - Assembly time: 1 hour
   - Extended baking time: 3 hours
   - Decoration time: 1 hour

   Total time on that day is:
   \( 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 \) hours

Therefore, it took Matthew 5 hours to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes on the day the oven failed.

To determine how long it took Matthew to make his cakes on the day his oven failed, we need to account for the additional time taken due to the malfunction. Normally, it takes him 1 hour to assemble ingredients, 1.5 hours to bake the cakes, and 1 hour to decorate each cake with cinnamon sprinkles. On the specific day, the baking time increased by 1 hour (since twice as long to bake the cakes as usual).

So, the normal total time is:
\[1 \text{ hour (assembly)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (baking)} + 1 \text{ hour (decorating)} = 3.5 \text{ hours}\]

Due to the oven malfunction, the baking time increased by 1 hour:
\[1.5 \text{ hours (normal baking time)} + 1 \text{ hour (increased baking time)} = 2.5 \text{ hours}\]

Adding the time for mixing ingredients and decorating:
\[1 \text{ hour (assembly)} + 2.5 \text{ hours (increased baking)} + 1 \text{ hour (decorating)} = 4.5 \text{ hours}\]

Thus, Matthew took 4.5 hours on that day to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes.

First, let's calculate the usual time Matthew spends making each caramel-apple coffee cake. It takes Matthew 1 hour to assemble ingredients, 1.5 hours to bake the cakes, and 1 hour to decorate them. So, in total, it takes him 1 + 1.5 + 1 = 3.5 hours to make each cake.

However, on the day when Matthew's oven fails, it takes twice as long to bake the cakes. Therefore, for baking on that day, it takes 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours instead of the usual 1.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time Matthew spent on the day when his oven failed. He still spends 1 hour assembling ingredients and 1 hour decorating the cakes. So, adding up the total time, we get 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 hours.

But remember, we're looking for the total time spent on one cake. So, if Matthew made one cake on this day, the total time spent would be 5 hours.

First, we need to determine the usual baking time for the cakes, which is 1.5 hours. On this particular day, the cakes took twice as long to bake, so the baking time became \(1.5 \times 2 = 3\) hours.

Next, we calculate the total time needed for a single cake. Including the assembly time, the usual bake time, and the decorating time, it takes \(1 + 1.5 + 1 = 3.5\) hours for one cake. 

On this particular day, Matthew had to decorate each of the cakes, so he still took 3 hours baking time. However, with two cakes, the total preparation time would be \(3.5 \times 2 = 7\) hours.

The decoration time for the second cake was \(3 + 1 = 4\) hours as it took twice as long to decorate the second cake. Adding the 2 hours from decorating the first cake, the total preparation time for both cakes was \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

So, the total time Matthew took to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes on that particular day was the assembling time plus the baking and decorating times, totaling \(2 \times 3.5\) hours.

Therefore, \(2 \times 3.5 = 7\) hours.

2. On the failed day, the baking time was twice the normal time, so it became \( 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \) hours.
3. The assembly and decoration times remained the same as usual: 1 hour each.

Now, let's sum up the baking time with the failed oven and the standard times for assembly and decoration:

\[ 1 \text{ hour (assembly)} + 3 \text{ hours (baking)} + 1 \text{ hour (decoration)} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

First, we need to determine the time Matthew spends on baking the cakes on the day his oven failed. Since it took twice as long to bake the cakes as it usually does, we can calculate the time spent baking by multiplying the usual baking time by 2:

\( \text{Usual baking time} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \)
\( \text{Baking time on failed oven} = 2 \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \)

On this day, Matthew also spent an additional 1 hour assembling ingredients and decorating each cake with cinnamon sprinkles. So, we add up all the times:

\( \text{Total time on failed oven} = \text{Assembling time} + \text{Baking time on failed oven} + \text{Decorating time} \)
\( \text{Total time on failed oven} = 1 \text{ hour} + 3 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} \)
