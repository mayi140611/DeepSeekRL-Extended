To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step. First, we need to find out how tall Carter is. Since Carter is twice as tall as his dog, and the dog is 24" tall, Carter's height is 2 * 24" = 48". Next, we need to find out Betty's height. Since Betty is 12" shorter than Carter, Betty's height is 48" - 12" = 36". To convert Carter's height from inches to feet, we need to remember that 1 foot = 12 inches. So, Carter's height in feet is 48" / 12 = 4 feet. Now, we need to find out Betty's height in feet. Since Betty's height in inches is 36", we convert this to feet using the same method: 36" / 12 = 3 feet. Finally, we can compare the heights of Carter and Betty. Carter is 4 feet tall, and Betty is 3 feet tall, so Betty is shorter than Carter.

To find Betty's height, first calculate Carter's height. Since Carter is twice as tall as his 24" tall dog, Carter is:
\[ 24" \times 2 = 48" \]

Next, we know that Betty is 12" shorter than Carter. So calculate Betty's height:
\[ 48" - 12" = 36" \]

Finally, convert Betty's height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
\[ 36" \div 12 = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Betty is 3 feet tall.

Carter is twice as tall as his 24” tall dog, so Carter is 2 * 24" = 48" tall. Betty is 12" shorter than Carter, so Betty is 48" - 12" = 36" tall. To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12, so Betty is 36" / 12 = 3 feet tall.

To determine Betty's height in feet, we first need to find Carter's height and then subtract 12 inches from that to find Betty's height.

1. Carter is twice as tall as his dog, which is 24 inches. So, Carter's height is:
\[ 2 \times 24 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

2. Betty is 12 inches shorter than Carter. So, Betty's height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} - 12 \text{ inches} = 36 \text{ inches} \]

3. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Betty's height from inches to feet by dividing by 12:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Betty is 3 feet tall.

To determine Betty's height, we first need to calculate Carter's height. Since Carter is twice as tall as his 24” tall dog, his height is \(2 \times 24\" = 48\"\).

Next, we calculate Carter's height by subtracting 12 inches (since Betty is 12 inches shorter than Carter):

\[ \text{Carter's height} - 12\" = 48\" - 12\" = 36\" \]

Now, to convert Carter's height from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

\[ 36\" \div 12 = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Betty is 3 feet tall.

To find Betty's height, we first need to determine Carter's height based on the height of his dog.

Since Carter is twice as tall as his 24” tall dog, we can calculate Carter's height as follows:
Carter's height = 2 * 24" = 48"

Next, we need to find Betty's height. Betty is 12 inches shorter than Carter, so:
Betty's height = Carter's height - 12" = 48" - 12" = 36"

To convert the height from inches to feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches), we divide Betty's height by 12:
Betty's height in feet = 36" / 12 = 3 feet

Therefore, Betty is 3 feet tall.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Carter's height:** 
   Carter is twice as tall as his dog, which is 24 inches. So, Carter's height is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) inches.

2. **Determine Betty's height:**
   Betty is 12 inches shorter than Carter. So, Betty's height is \(48 - 12 = 36\) inches.

3. **Convert Carter's height to feet:**
   Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert Carter's height to feet by dividing by 12. So, Carter's height in feet is \(\frac{48}{12} = 4\) feet.

4. **Convert Betty's height to feet:**
   Similarly, Betty's height is already in inches, but to get her height in feet, we divide by 12. So, Betty's height in feet is \(\frac{36}{12} = 3\) feet.

Therefore, Betty is 3 feet tall.

<reasoning>
Let's denote Carter's height as \( C \).

Carter is twice as tall as his 24” dog, so Carter's height \( C = 2 \times 24 = 48" \).

Betty is 12" shorter than Carter, so Betty's height \( B = C - 12 = 48 - 12 = 36" \).

To convert Carter's height from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches} \).
Thus, Carter's height in feet is \( \frac{48}{12} = 4 \text{ feet} \). 

Therefore, Betty's height is also 4 feet.

To find out how tall Betty is in feet, let's start by calculating Carter's height in inches.

Carter is twice as tall as his dog, and the dog is 24 inches tall.

\[ \text{Carter's height} = 2 \times \text{Dog's height} = 2 \times 24 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate Betty's height in inches. Betty is 12 inches shorter than Carter.

\[ \text{Betty's height in inches} = \text{Carter's height} - 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches} - 12 \text{ inches} = 36 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to convert Betty's height from inches to feet, we use the fact that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Betty's height in feet} = \frac{\text{Betty's height in inches}}{12} = \frac{36 \text{ inches}}{12} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Betty is 3 feet tall.

To determine Betty's height in feet, we'll follow these steps:

1. First, find Carter's height. Since Carter is twice as tall as his dog, we calculate:

2. Next, find Betty's height. Betty is 12" shorter than Carter:
   Betty's height in inches = 48" - 12" = 36"

3. Since height is typically measured in feet, we convert Betty's height from inches to feet by dividing by 12:
   Betty's height in feet = 36" / 12 = 3 feet

Therefore, Betty is 3 feet tall.
