First, let's find the price of the bed. The bed is 10 times the price of the bed frame. Since the bed frame costs $75, the bed costs:
\[ 10 \times 75 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost before the discount. The total cost for both the bed and the bed frame is:
\[ 75 + 750 = 825 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means James pays 80% of the original total cost. So, the discounted price is:
\[ 825 \times 0.80 = 660 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, James pays $660 for everything.

To determine how much James pays for everything, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the bed.
2. Find the total price before the discount.
3. Apply the 20% discount to find the final price.

First, we know the bed frame costs $75.

Next, we calculate the cost of the bed. Since the bed is 10 times the price of the bed frame, we multiply the bed frame's price by 10:

\[ 75 \times 10 = 750 \]

So, the bed costs $750.

Now, we find the total price before the discount by adding the cost of the bed frame and the bed:

\[ 75 + 750 = 825 \]

The total price is $825.

Since James gets a 20% discount, we first calculate 20% of $825:

\[ 825 \times 0.20 = 165 \]

Next, we subtract this discount from the total price to find the final price:

\[ 825 - 165 = 660 \]

So, James pays $660 for everything.

To find the total cost James pays for the bed and bed frame, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the bed.
2. Find the total cost before the discount.
3. Apply the 20% discount to get the final price.

Step 1: Calculate the price of the bed.
The bed is 10 times the price of the bed frame.
Bed frame = $75
Bed = 10 * $75 = $750

Step 2: Find the total cost before the discount.
Total cost before discount = Bed frame + Bed
Total cost before discount = $75 + $750 = $825

Step 3: Apply the 20% discount.
Discount = 20% of $825 = 0.20 * $825 = $165
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost after discount = $825 - $165 = $660

Therefore, James pays $660 for everything.

First, let's calculate the price of the bed.

The bed is 10 times the price of the bed frame. Since the bed frame is $75, the bed will cost:

\[ \text{Bed price} = 10 \times 75 = 750 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, James gets a 20% discount on the total price of the bed and bed frame.

The total price without discount is the sum of the bed frame and bed prices:

\[ \text{Total price without discount} = 75 + 750 = 825 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the discount, which is 20% of the total price:

\[ \text{Discount} = 0.20 \times 825 = 165 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total price to find out the final amount James pays:

\[ \text{Final amount} = 825 - 165 = 660 \, \text{dollars} \]

To determine how much James pays for the bed and bed frame after the 20% discount, we first need to calculate the price of the bed.

The bed frame costs $75. The bed is 10 times the price of the bed frame, so the bed costs:
\[ 10 \times 75 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount:
\[ 75 \text{ (bed frame)} + 750 \text{ (bed)} = 825 \text{ dollars} \]

James gets a 20% discount on the total price. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $825:
\[ 0.20 \times 825 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total price to find out how much James pays:

Let's calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Calculate the price of the bed:**
   The bed is 10 times the price of the bed frame. The bed frame costs $75.
   \[
   \text{Price of the bed} = 10 \times 75 = 750
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   Add the price of the bed frame and the price of the bed.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 75 + 750 = 825
   \]

3. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   A 20% discount means James pays 80% of the total cost (100% - 20% = 80%).
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 825 \times 0.20 = 165
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 825 - 165 = 660
   \]

So, James pays $660 for everything.

To find out how much James pays for the bed and bed frame with the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the bed.
2. Calculate the total price before the discount.
3. Calculate the discount amount.
4. Calculate the total price after the discount.

The bed frame costs $75.
The bed costs 10 times the price of the bed frame, so the bed costs $75 * 10 = $750.
The total price before the discount is the sum of the bed frame and the bed, which is $75 + $750 = $825.

The discount is 20% off, so the discount amount is $825 * 20% = $825 * 0.20 = $165.

The total price James pays after the discount is the total price before the discount minus the discount amount, which is $825 - $165 = $660.

First, we need to determine the price of the bed. Since the bed is 10 times the price of the bed frame, we calculate the bed's price as follows:
\[ \text{Bed Price} = 10 \times \text{Bed Frame Price} \]
\[ \text{Bed Price} = 10 \times 75 \]
\[ \text{Bed Price} = 750 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the bed and the bed frame. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ \text{Total Cost Before Discount} = \text{Bed Price} + \text{Bed Frame Price} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost Before Discount} = 750 + 75 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost Before Discount} = 825 \]

Now, we calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 0.20 \times \text{Total Cost Before Discount} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 0.20 \times 825 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 165 \]

We subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to find the final amount James pays:
\[ \text{Final Amount} = \text{Total Cost Before Discount} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Amount} = 825 - 165 \]

To find out how much James pays, let's first find the price of the bed. Since the bed is 10 times the price of the bed frame, the bed costs $75 * 10 = $750. The total cost before the discount would be the cost of the bed frame and the bed, which is $75 + $750 = $825. Then, we can apply the 20% discount he gets for buying the deal, which means he pays 100% - 20% = 80% of the total price. So, the final price he pays would be $825 * 80% = $660.
