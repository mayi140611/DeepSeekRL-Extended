system
To find out the total number of trees on Randy's farm, we need to first calculate the number of coconut trees. We know that Randy has 60 mango trees, so we can find half of that number and then subtract 5 to find the number of coconut trees.

First, calculate half of the mango trees:
\[ \text{Half of mango trees} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, subtract 5 from that number to find the coconut trees:
\[ \text{Coconut trees} = 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Now, add the number of mango trees to the number of coconut trees to find the total number of trees on the farm:
\[ \text{Total trees} = \text{Mango trees} + \text{Coconut trees} = 60 + 25 = 85 \]

Therefore, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm.

To determine the total number of trees on Randy's farm, let's first calculate the number of coconut trees. 

Given that Randy has 60 mango trees, we can find half this number to determine the number of coconut trees. 

\[ \text{Half of 60 trees} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

The problem states that Randy has 5 less than this half, so:

\[ \text{Number of coconut trees} = \text{Half of 60} - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Now, to find the total number of trees on the farm, we add the number of mango trees to the number of coconut trees:

\[ \text{Total number of trees} = \text{Number of mango trees} + \text{Number of coconut trees} = 60 + 25 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total number of trees on Randy's farm is 85.

To determine the total number of trees on Randy's farm, we need to calculate the number of coconut trees first and then add them to the number of mango trees.

1. **Calculate the number of coconut trees:**
   - Randy has 60 mango trees.
   - The number of coconut trees is given as 5 less than half of the number of mango trees.

   First, find half of the number of mango trees:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

   Then, subtract 5 from this value to find the number of coconut trees:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

   So, Randy has 25 coconut trees.

2. **Calculate the total number of trees:**
   - The total number of trees on the farm is the sum of the mango trees and the coconut trees:
   \[
   60 \text{ (mango trees)} + 25 \text{ (coconut trees)} = 85
   \]

Therefore, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm.

To find the total number of trees Randy has on his farm, we need to first determine the number of coconut trees. We know that he has 60 mango trees, and he has 5 less than half as many coconut trees. 

Half of the mango trees is 60 / 2 = 30. 

So, the number of coconut trees is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, to find the total number of trees, we add the number of mango trees and coconut trees: 60 (mango trees) + 25 (coconut trees) = 85 trees.

Therefore, Randy has 85 trees in all on his farm.

To determine the total number of trees on Randy's farm, we need to calculate the number of coconut trees and then add it to the number of mango trees.

First, we identify the number of mango trees, which is given as 60. So, the number of mango trees is:
\[ \text{Number of mango trees} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find the number of coconut trees. According to the problem, the number of coconut trees is 5 less than half the number of mango trees. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ \text{Number of coconut trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of mango trees} - 5 \]
Substituting the number of mango trees, we get:
\[ \text{Number of coconut trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of mango trees and the number of coconut trees to find the total number of trees on Randy's farm:
\[ \text{Total number of trees} = \text{Number of mango trees} + \text{Number of coconut trees} = 60 + 25 = 85 \]

Thus, the total number of trees on Randy's farm is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]

To find out the total number of trees Randy has on his farm, we first need to determine the number of coconut trees.

Given: 
- Number of mango trees = 60
- Number of coconut trees = \((\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of mango trees}) - 5\)

First, calculate half of the number of mango trees:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
\]

Next, subtract 5 from this result to find the number of coconut trees:
\[
30 - 5 = 25
\]

Now, add the number of mango trees and the number of coconut trees to find the total number of trees:
\[
60 + 25 = 85
\]

So, the total number of trees Randy has on his farm is 85.

To find the total number of trees on Randy's farm, we first need to calculate the number of coconut trees. 

Half of the mango trees is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \) trees. 

Randy has 5 less than this amount, which is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \) coconut trees.

Now, we add the number of mango trees and coconut trees to find the total number of trees on Randy's farm:

Mango trees + Coconut trees = Total trees
\( 60 + 25 = 85 \) trees

Therefore, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm.

To determine the total number of trees on Randy's farm, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of mango trees Randy has.
2. Calculate the number of coconut trees Randy has.
3. Add the number of mango trees and coconut trees to find the total number of trees.

First, we know that Randy has 60 mango trees. This is given directly in the problem.

Next, we need to calculate the number of coconut trees. The problem states that Randy has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. To find the number of coconut trees, we start by determining half the number of mango trees:

\[
\text{Number of coconut trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
\]

However, the problem states that Randy has 5 less than this amount, so we subtract 5 from 30:

\[
\text{Number of coconut trees} = 30 - 5 = 25
\]

Now, we add the number of mango trees and coconut trees to find the total number of trees:

\[
\text{Total number of trees} = 60 + 25 = 85
\]

Therefore, the total number of trees on Randy's farm is \boxed{85}.

To determine the total number of trees on Randy's farm, we first need to find out how many coconut trees he has.

The problem states that Randy has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. We can express this as:
\[
\text{Number of coconut trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of mango trees} - 5
\]

Given that the number of mango trees is 60, we substitute this value into the equation:

First, calculate half of 60:

\]

Next, subtract 5 from 30:
\[
30 - 5 = 25
\]

So, Randy has 25 coconut trees.

Now, we add the number of mango trees and coconut trees to find the total number of trees on Randy's farm:
\[
\text{Total number of trees} = \text{Number of mango trees} + \text{Number of coconut trees}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of trees} = 60 + 25 = 85
\]

Therefore, the total number of trees on Randy's farm is:

To find out how many trees Randy has in all on his farm, we need to first calculate the number of coconut trees. Since he has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees, we can express this mathematically as:

\( \text{number of coconut trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{number of mango trees} - 5 \)

We know that Randy has 60 mango trees, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

\( \text{number of coconut trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 - 5 \)

Now we can solve for the number of coconut trees:

\( \text{number of coconut trees} = 30 - 5 \)
\( \text{number of coconut trees} = 25 \)

Now that we know Randy has 25 coconut trees, we can add the number of mango trees and coconut trees to find the total number of trees on his farm:

\( \text{total number of trees} = \text{number of mango trees} + \text{number of coconut trees} \)
\( \text{total number of trees} = 60 + 25 \)
\( \text{total number of trees} = 85 \)

Therefore, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm.
