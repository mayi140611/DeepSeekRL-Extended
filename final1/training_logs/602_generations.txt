#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Alyssa collected 30 cans and Abigail collected 43 cans, which totals 30 + 43 = 73 cans.

They need to collect 100 cans for their project. So, they still need to collect 100 - 73 = 27 more cans.

To determine how many more empty cans Alyssa and Abigail need to collect, we need to first find out the total number of cans they have already collected and then subtract that from the total required.

1. Calculate the total number of cans collected:
   \[
   \text{Total cans collected} = \text{Cans collected by Alyssa} + \text{Cans collected by Abigail} = 30 + 43
   \]
   \[
   30 + 43 = 73
   \]

2. Determine how many more cans they need to collect:
   \[
   \text{Cans still needed} = \text{Total cans required} - \text{Cans already collected} = 100 - 73
   \]
   \[
   100 - 73 = 27
   \]

So, Alyssa and Abigail still need to collect 27 more empty cans.

Together, Alyssa and Abigail have collected \( 30 + 43 = 73 \) cans.

They need to collect a total of 100 cans, so they still need \( 100 - 73 = 27 \) cans.

Alyssa has already collected 30 cans, and Abigail has 43 cans. To find out how many more they need to collect, we add Alyssaâ€™s and Abigail's cans together and subtract the total from their goal of 100 cans.

Let's do the calculations:

Total cans already collected by Alyssa and Abigail = Alyssa's cans + Abigail's cans
                                           = 30 + 43
                                           = 73 cans

Now, subtract this total from their goal:

100 cans (goal) - 73 cans (already collected) = 27 cans

Therefore, they need to collect 27 more empty cans.

To find out how many more empty cans Alyssa and Abigail need to collect, we need to subtract the total number of cans they have already collected from the total number of cans they need to collect.

Alyssa has collected 30 cans, and Abigail has collected 43 cans. So, together they have collected 30 + 43 = 73 cans.

They need to collect a total of 100 cans, so the number of additional cans they need to collect is 100 - 73 = 27 cans.

system
To determine how many more empty cans Alyssa and Abigail need to collect, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cans collected so far by adding the number of cans Alyssa and Abigail have collected.
2. Subtract the total number of cans collected from the total number of cans they need to collect.

First, let's find the total number of cans collected so far:
\[ 30 \text{ ( Alyssa's cans)} + 43 \text{ (Abigail's cans)} = 73 \text{ cans} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more cans are required to reach their goal of 100 cans:
\[ 100 \text{ (total needed)} - 73 \text{ (total collected)} = 27 \text{ cans} \]

Therefore, Alyssa and Abigail need to collect 27 more empty cans.

To find out how many more empty cans Alyssa and Abigail need to collect, we need to subtract the number of cans they have already collected from the total number they need to collect.

Total number of cans needed = 100
Number of cans Alyssa collected = 30
Number of cans Abigail collected = 43

Number of cans left to collect = Total number of cans needed - Sum of cans collected by Alyssa and Abigail

Number of cans left to collect = 100 - (30 + 43)
Number of cans left to collect = 100 - 73
Number of cans left to collect = 27

Alyssa and Abigail should collect 27 more empty cans.

To find out how many more empty cans Alyssa and Abigail need to collect, we first need to calculate how many cans they have already collected together.

Alyssa collected 30 cans.
Abigail collected 43 cans.

Total cans collected so far = Alyssa's cans + Abigail's cans
= 30 cans + 43 cans
= 73 cans

They need to collect a total of 100 cans for their project. So, to find out how many more they need to collect, we subtract the number of cans they have already collected from the total:

Number of cans needed - Cans already collected = Cans still needed
= 100 cans - 73 cans
= 27 cans

Therefore, Alyssa and Abigail need to collect 27 more empty cans.

To solve this, first find the total cans they have collected already by adding the cans collected by Alyssa and Abigail: 

\[
\text{Total collected so far} = 30 + 43 = 73
\]

Next, to find out how many more cans they need to collect to reach their goal of 100 cans, subtract the total collected so far from their goal:

\[
\text{Cans needed} = 100 - 73 = 27
\]

So, Alyssa and Abigail should collect **27 more cans** to reach their goal.

To find out how many more empty cans Alyssa and Abigail need to collect, we first need to determine the total number of cans they already have collected. Add Alyssa's and Abigail's collected cans:

Alyssa's collected cans: 30
Abigail's collected cans: 43

Total collected cans = Alyssa's cans + Abigail's cans
Total collected cans = 30 + 43
Total collected cans = 73

They need a total of 100 empty cans for their project, so we need to find the difference between the total required and the total collected so far:

Total needed: 100 cans
Total collected: 73 cans

Cans needed to collect = Total needed - Total collected
Cans needed to collect = 100 - 73
Cans needed to collect = 27

Therefore, Alyssa and Abigail need to collect 27 more empty cans.
