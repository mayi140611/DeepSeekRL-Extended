To find out how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we first need to determine the total amount of iced tea and lemonade used for one drink. One drink consists of \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup of iced tea and \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) cups of lemonade, which can be written as \( 1.25 \) cups of lemonade. Therefore, a total of \( \frac{1}{4} + 1.25 = 1.55 \) cups of drink for one drink.

Since the pitcher holds 18 total cups of this drink, we can calculate the number of drinks and then the amount of lemonade. 

First, let's find out how many drinks fit into 18 cups:

\[ \text{Number of drinks} = \frac{18}{1.55} \]

\[ = 11.64 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a drink, Abigail can make 11 full drinks, which is the largest whole number of drinks that fits within 18 cups.

Next, we find out how much lemonade is used for 11 drinks:

\[ \text{Total lemonade} = 11 \times 1.25 \]

\[ = 13.75 \]

Therefore, there are 13.75 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.

To determine how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we first need to find out the total amount of liquid in one drink in cups. The recipe calls for 1/4 cup of iced tea and 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade. First, let's add these amounts together to find the total liquid in one drink:

1/4 cup of iced tea + 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade = 1/4 + 1 + 1/4 = 2 + 1/4 = 2 1/4 cups of liquid in one drink.

Next, we know that Abigail fills the pitcher with 18 total cups of this drink. To find out how much lemonade is in the pitcher, we multiply the amount of lemonade per drink by the total number of drinks:

2 1/4 cups per drink × 18 drinks = 2.25 cups per drink × 18 drinks = 40.5 cups of lemonade.

Therefore, there are 40.5 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the ratio of iced tea to lemonade in one drink. The recipe specifies that for each drink, we need 1/4 cup of iced tea and 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade.

First, let's convert 1 and 1/4 into a fraction of a whole:
\[ 1 \frac{1}{4} = 1 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \]

Now, let’s find the total amount of lemonade per drink:
\[ \frac{5}{4} \text{ cups of lemonade} \]

Since we need a total of 18 cups of this drink, we can multiply the amount of lemonade per drink by the number of cups:
\[ 18 \text{ cups} \times \frac{5}{4} \]

To calculate this, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 18 \div 4 = 4.5 \]
\[ 4.5 \times 5 = 22.5 \]

Thus, the total amount of lemonade in the pitcher is:
\[ \boxed{22.5} \] cups.

To find out how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we first need to determine the total number of drinks made. 

Each drink uses:
- 1/4 cup of iced tea
- 1 1/4 cups of lemonade

Adding these together, we get:
1/4 cup + 1 1/4 cups = 1 + 1/2 cups

So, each drink uses 1.5 cups in total.

If 18 total cups make one drink, then the number of drinks in the pitcher is:
18 cups ÷ 1.5 cups per drink = 12 drinks

Since each drink uses 1 1/4 cups of lemonade in total, then for 12 drinks, the total cups of lemonade is:
12 drinks × 1 1/4 cups per drink = 12 × 1.25 cups

Now let's calculate that multiplication:
12 × 1.25 = 15 cups

Therefore, there are 15 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.

To determine how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we need to first figure out how much lemonade abigail uses for each drink. The recipe calls for 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade per drink, which can be written as \(1.25\) cups.

If she fills a pitcher with 18 total cups of the drink, the number of drinks she can make from the pitcher is the total amount of the drink (18 cups) divided by the amount of drink each recipe makes. Since each recipe makes \(\frac{1}{4}\) cup of tea and \(1.25\) cups of lemonade, each recipe totals \(\frac{1}{4} + 1.25\) cups.

Therefore, we divide the total amount of the drink in the pitcher by the total amount per recipe:
\[18 \div \left(\frac{1}{4} + 1.25\right).\]

First, let's convert \(1.25\) to a fraction:
\[1.25 = \frac{5}{4}.\]

So, we have:
\[\frac{1}{4} + \frac{5}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}.\]

Now, we perform the division:
\[18 \div \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times \frac{2}{3} = 12.\]

This tells us that Abigail can make 12 complete recipes in the pitcher. Since each recipe uses \(1.25\) cups of lemonade, the total amount of lemonade in the pitcher is:
\[12 \times 1.25 = 15.\]

Therefore, there are 15 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.

Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. First, we need to determine how many total cups of the drink Abigail made from her pitcher.
2. We know the pitcher is filled with 18 total cups of drink.
3. Each drink requires 1/4 cup of iced tea and 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade.
4. To find out how many drinks Abigail made, we divide the total cups of drink by the amount of drink each requires: 18 / 2 = 9 drinks (since 1/4 cup + 1 and 1/4 cup = 1 cup).
5. Now that we know each drink is 1 cup, we can calculate the total amount of lemonade needed. Each drink requires 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade: 9 * 1 and 1/4 = 9 and 9/4 = 11 and 3/4 cups.
6. This means there is 11 and 3/4 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.

Therefore, the reasoning leads us to conclude that 11 and 3/4 cups of lemonade are in the pitcher.

To find out how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we first need to determine the total amount of drink made.

The recipe uses:
- \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup of iced tea
- \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) cups of lemonade

First, convert \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) to a fraction for easier calculation:
- \( 1 \frac{1}{4} = 1 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \)

Now, add the amounts of iced tea and lemonade:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{5}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \]

So, each drink contains \( 1.5 \) cups of the drink mix.

Next, we need to find out how many 1.5-unit drinks can be made with 18 cups of the drink mix. To do this, divide the total cups by the amount per drink:
\[ \text{Number of drinks} = \frac{18}{1.5} = 12 \]

Since each drink contains \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) cups of lemonade, the total amount of lemonade is:
\[ 12 \times 1 \frac{1}{4} = 12 \times 1.25 = 15 \]

Thus, there are \( 15 \) cups of lemonade in the pitcher.

To find out how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we need to calculate the total amount of the drink made from the pitcher and then subtract the amount of iced tea from that total.

Given:
- The recipe uses \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup of iced tea and \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) cup of lemonade per drink.
- There are 18 total cups in the pitcher.

First, convert \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) to an improper fraction:
\[ 1 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \]

Now, let \( x \) be the number of drinks made with 18 total cups. Each drink contains \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{5}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2} \) cups of the drink.

The total cups of the drink made from 18 cups is then:
\[ 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

This sum should equal the number of drinks multiplied by the total cups per drink:
\[ 27 = x \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ 27 = \frac{3x}{2} \]

To find \( x \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{3} \):
\[ x = 27 \times \frac{2}{3} = 18 \]

Now, calculate the total amount of lemonade in the pitcher:
\[ 18 \times \frac{5}{4} = \frac{90}{4} = 22.5 \]

So, there are 22.5 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.

To find out how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we first need to calculate how many full servings of the drink are in 18 cups.

The recipe makes one drink using:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup of iced tea} \text{ + } \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup of lemonade} \]

First, let's calculate the total volume of one drink:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{16} \]

\[ = \frac{4}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{5}{16} \text{ cups} \]

Now, to find out how many full servings are in 18 cups:

\[ \text{Number of full servings} = \frac{18}{\frac{5}{16}} \]

\[ = 18 \times \frac{16}{5} \]

\[ = \frac{288}{5} \]

\[ = 57.6 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving includes \(\frac{1}{4}\) cup of lemonade, for 57.6 servings, the total amount of lemonade is:

\[ 57.6 \times \frac{1}{4} \]

\[ = 14.4 \text{ cups of lemonade} \]

So, there are 14.4 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.

To determine how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we can start by calculating the total amount of the drink that one pitcher contains. Since one pitcher consists of one drink, and each drink is made with \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup of iced tea and \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) cups of lemonade, we first need to find the total amount of iced tea in one drink:

\[ \text{Total iced tea in one drink} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of lemonade in one drink:

\[ \text{Total lemonade in one drink} = 1 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ cups} \]

Now we add the total amounts of both ingredients to find the total amount of the drink in one pitcher:

\[ \text{Total drink in one pitcher} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup} \right) + \left( \frac{5}{4} \text{ cups} \right) = \frac{1 + 5}{4} \text{ cups} = \frac{6}{4} \text{ cups} = 1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ cups} \]

Since the pitcher contains 18 total cups of this drink, we can set up the following equation to find the number of cups of lemonade in the pitcher:

\[ 1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ cups per pitcher} = 18 \text{ cups in total} \]

Next, we isolate the term containing the number of cups of lemonade:

\[ \text{Number of cups of lemonade} = 18 \text{ cups} - 1.5 \text{ cups} = 16.5 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, there are 16.5 cups of lemonade in the 18 total cups of the drink in the pitcher.

Now, since each drink uses \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup of iced tea, the total amount of iced tea in the pitcher is:

\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3 \text{ cups} \]

In order to find the total amount of lemonade in the pitcher, we subtract the total amount of iced tea from the total amount of drink:

To find out how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we first need to determine the total amount of the drink made from one batch and then calculate how many batches can be made with 18 total cups.

Since each drink requires \(\frac{1}{4}\) cup of iced tea and \(1 \frac{1}{4}\) cups of lemonade, we calculate the total ingredients for one drink:

\[ \text{Total for one drink} = \frac{1}{4} + 1 \frac{1}{4} \]

First, convert \(1 \frac{1}{4}\) to an improper fraction:

\[ 1 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{5}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1 \frac{2}{4} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ 1 \frac{2}{4} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \]

So, each batch of the drink is \(\frac{3}{2}\) cups. 

Next, we calculate how many batches can be made with 18 cups of the drink:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{18}{\frac{3}{2}} = 18 \times \frac{2}{3} = 12 \]

Now, we need to find out how much lemonade is in 12 batches. Since each batch uses \(1 \frac{1}{4}\) or \(\frac{5}{4}\) cups of lemonade:

\[ \text{Lemonade per batch} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ cups} \]

For 12 batches:

\[ \text{Total lemonade} = 12 \times \frac{5}{4} = 12 \times 1.25 = 15 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, there are 15 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.
