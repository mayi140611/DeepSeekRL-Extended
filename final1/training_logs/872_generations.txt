<reasoning>
To determine how many people joined in the final third verse, we can follow these steps:

1. In the first verse, half of the 30 singers sang. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) singers sang in the first verse.
2. The number of singers who did not join in the first verse is \( 30 - 15 = 15 \).
3. In the second verse, a third of the remaining 15 singers joined. So, \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) singers joined in the second verse.
4. The total number of singers who joined in the first two verses is \( 15 + 5 = 20 \).
5. Since the whole choir sang together, the remaining singers are \( 30 - 20 = 10 \) singers.

Therefore, 10 people joined in the final third verse.

Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. In the first verse, half of the 30 singers sang. That's \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) singers.
2. This leaves \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) singers remaining.
3. In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers joined in. That's \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) singers.
4. This leaves \( 15 - 5 = 10 \) singers remaining from the original group.

So, the final verse was sung by the remaining 10 singers.

Therefore, 10 people joined in the final third verse.

<reasoning>
Initially, the choir consists of 30 singers. In the first verse, half of the 30 singers sang, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) singers. 

In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers joined in. The remaining singers after the first verse are \( 30 - 15 = 15 \). A third of these 15 singers join, which is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) singers.

So, after the first two verses, only 5 new singers join in the final third verse.

The total number of new singers who sang in the final third verse is 5.

Therefore, the total number of people who sang together in the final third verse is the remaining singers from the first two verses plus the new singers from the final verse, which is \( 30 - 15 - 5 = 10 \) singers.

So, 10 new singers joined in the final third verse.

Let's calculate step by step:

1. In the first verse, half of the 30 singers sang:
   \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) singers.

After the first verse, there are 30 - 15 = 15 singers left.

2. In the second verse, a third of the remaining 15 singers joined:
   \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) singers.

After the second verse, there are 15 - 5 = 10 singers left.

So, in the final third verse, the whole choir of 30 people sang together.

Therefore, the final answer is 30 singers joined in the final third verse.

In the first verse, half of the 30 singers sang. This means 30 / 2 = 15 singers sang in the first verse. 
In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers joined in. There were 30 - 15 = 15 singers remaining after the first verse. So, 15 / 3 = 5 singers joined in the second verse. 
In total, 15 + 5 = 20 singers were singing in the first two verses.
To find out how many people joined in the final third verse, we need to subtract the total number of singers that sang in the first two verses from the total number of singers in the choir. 
So, 30 - 20 = 10 people joined in the final third verse.

In the first verse, half of the 30 singers sang. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) singers joined. This left 30 - 15 = 15 singers remaining.

In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers (15) joined in. So, \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) singers joined. Now, the total number of singers is 30 (from the first verse) + 5 (from the second verse) = 35.

So for the third verse, the whole choir sang together, making 35 singers. This means \( 35 - 30 = 5 \) people joined in the third verse.

Therefore, 5 people joined in the final third verse.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First verse: Half of the 30 singers sang. 
   Number of singers who sang in the first verse = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

2. Remaining singers after the first verse:
   Total singers initially - singers who sang in verse 1 = \( 30 - 15 = 15 \)

3. Second verse: A third of the remaining singers joined in.
   Number of new singers who joined the second verse = \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \)

4. Total singers who sang in the second verse:
   Singers from the first verse + new singers from the second verse = \( 15 + 5 = 20 \)

5. Third verse: All 30 singers sang together.
   Number of singers who joined in the third verse = 30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, 10 people joined in the final third verse that the whole choir sang together.

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Determine how many singers sang in the first verse.
2. Calculate how many singers remained after the first verse.
3. Find out how many singers joined in the second verse.
4. Calculate how many singers joined in the final third verse.

First, the total number of singers is 30. In the first verse, half of them sang, so:
\[ \text{Singers in the first verse} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

After the first verse, 15 singers sang, leaving 15 singers remaining:
\[ \text{Singers remaining} = 30 - 15 = 15 \]

In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers joined in:
\[ \text{Singers in the second verse} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

After the second verse, 5 singers joined, leaving:
\[ \text{Singers remaining} = 15 - 5 = 10 \]

In the final third verse, the whole choir sang together, so all 10 remaining singers joined:
\[ \text{Total number of singers in the final verse} = 10 \]

So, the number of people who joined in the final third verse that the whole choir sang together is 10.

<reasoning>
Initially, 30 singers were in the choir. In the first verse, half of them sang, which means \(30 / 2 = 15\) singers sang and the rest remained silent, so \(30 - 15 = 15\) singers did not sing.

In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers joined in, which means \(15 / 3 = 5\) additional singers sang. So in the second verse, \(15 + 5 = 20\) singers sang.

The total number of singers who sang in the first two verses is \(15 + 20 = 35\). The choir was initially composed of 30 people, so 5 people were not included in the first two verses.

In the final third verse, the entire choir sang together, so no new singers joined this time. The number of people joining the final third verse is 5.

Therefore, 5 people joined in the final third verse.

Let's determine the number of singers who joined in the first verse. Since half of the 30 singers sang in the first verse:
\[
\frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ singers}
\]

In the second verse, one third of the remaining singers (which is \(30 - 15 = 15\)) joined in:
\[
\frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ singers}
\]

So, the total number of singers in the first and second verses is:
\[
15 + 5 = 20 \text{ singers}
\]

Thus, the number of singers who still needed to join in the third verse to make up the entire choir (30 singers) is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10 \text{ singers}
\]

Therefore, 10 people joined in the final third verse.

Initially, there are 30 singers in the choir. In the first verse, half of them sang, so that leaves 30/2 = 15 singers remaining. In the second verse, a third of these remaining singers joined in, so 15/3 = 5 singers joined. Therefore, there are 15 - 5 = 10 singers remaining.

In the final verse, the whole choir sang together. This would mean that all 10 remaining singers and all the original 15 singers who sang in the first verse joined, making a total of 10 + 15 = 25 singers singing in the final verse.

So, 25 people joined in the final verse.

<reasoning>
First, we need to find out how many singers sang in the first verse. Since half of the 30 singers sang, we calculate:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, 15 singers sang in the first verse.

Next, we need to determine how many singers remained after the first verse. Subtracting the singers who sang in the first verse from the total gives us:

\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers joined in. So we calculate:

\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

Thus, 5 new singers joined in the second verse, bringing the total number of singers for the second verse to:

\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Now, in the final third verse, the whole choir sang together. Since there were originally 30 singers and 20 of them sang in the second verse, the remaining singers for the final third verse are:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, 10 people joined in the final third verse.
