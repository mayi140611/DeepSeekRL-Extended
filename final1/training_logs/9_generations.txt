system
To calculate Tina's total earnings, we need to first determine her regular hours and overtime hours.

Regular hours: 8 hours/day * 5 days = 40 hours
Overtime hours: 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours

Now we calculate her overtime pay:
Overtime pay = 2 hours * ($18.00 + $9.00) = 2 hours * $27.00 = $54.00

Next we calculate her regular pay:
Regular pay = 40 hours * $18.00 = $720.00

Lastly, we add both her regular and overtime pay to determine her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $720.00 + $54.00 = $774.00

Therefore, the answer is 774.

First, calculate the amount Tina earns for the first 8 hours:
$$18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 144 \text{ dollars}$$

Next, calculate the amount she earns for the overtime hours:
$$18 \text{ dollars/hour} + \frac{1}{2}(18 \text{ dollars/hour}) = 27 \text{ dollars/hour}$$

Then, calculate the amount she earns for the 2 hours of overtime:
$$27 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ dollars}$$

Finally, add the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to calculate the total amount she earns:
$$144 \text{ dollars} + 54 \text{ dollars} = 198 \text{ dollars}$$

Therefore, the answer is 198.

To calculate the total amount of money Tina makes, we need to consider her regular pay for the first 8 hours and her overtime pay for the additional 2 hours.

First, let's calculate the regular pay:
Regular pay = $18 per hour * 8 hours = $144

Next, let's calculate the overtime pay:
Regular pay = $18 per hour * 8 hours = $144
Overtime pay = $18 per hour + 1/2 * $18 per hour = $18 + $9 = $27 per hour for overtime
Overtime pay for 2 hours = $27 per hour * 2 hours = $54

Now, let's add the regular pay and the overtime pay to get the total amount:
Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $144 + $54 = $198

Tina makes $198 in total from working 10 hours every day for 5 days.

First, we need to determine the overtime rate which is calculated as the hourly wage plus half the hourly wage, which is $18 + ($18 / 2) = $18 + $9 = $27 per hour.

Next, we calculate the regular and overtime pay for a single day. Regular pay for one day is $18 per hour * 8 hours = $144. Overtime pay for one day is $27 per hour * 2 hours = $54. Therefore, the total pay for one day is $144 + $54 = $198. 

Finally, we calculate the total pay for 5 days by multiplying the daily pay by the number of days: $198 per day * 5 days = $990.

Therefore, we can conclude that Tina makes $990.

To calculate Tina's earnings, we need to consider the number of regular and overtime hours she works.

First, let's determine if any of her hours are overtime. Tina's regular shift is 8 hours, and she works 10 hours, which means she has 2 overtime hours.

Regular hours: 8 hours
Overtime hours: 2 hours

Now, we calculate her earnings:

Regular earnings: 8 hours * $18/hour = $144
Overtime earnings: 2 hours * ($18/hour + 1/2 * $18/hour) = 2 hours * ($18/hour + $9/hour) = 2 hours * $27/hour = $54

Total earnings: Regular earnings + Overtime earnings = $144 + $54 = $198

To determine how much money Tina makes, we need to calculate her earnings for each day and then multiply by the number of days she works.

First, let's calculate her earnings for one day:
- Tina works 10 hours a day.
- She is eligible for overtime because she works more than 8 hours.
- Overtime pay is her hourly wage + 1/2 her hourly wage, which is \(18 + \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 18 + 9 = 27\) dollars per hour.

So, for one day, her earnings are:
- Regular pay for 8 hours: \(8 \times 18 = 144\) dollars.
- Overtime pay for the additional 2 hours: \(2 \times 27 = 54\) dollars.
- Total earnings for one day: \(144 + 54 = 198\) dollars.

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her daily earnings by the number of days she works:
- She works 10 hours per day for 5 days, so the total hours worked in a week is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) hours.
- Her weekly earning is \(50 \times 198 = 9900\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tina makes in a week is \(\boxed{9900}\) dollars.

To determine how much money Tina makes in a week, we need to break down her earnings by hours and overtime.

First, calculate her regular hourly wage and overtime wage:
- Regular hourly wage: $18.00
- Overtime hourly wage: $18.00 + $18.00 / 2 = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00

Next, determine how many hours she works at each wage rate:
- Regular hours: 8 hours per day
- Overtime hours: 10 hours every day - 8 hours = 2 hours

Now, calculate her earnings:
- Earnings from regular hours: 8 hours * $18.00/hour = $144.00 per day
- Earnings from overtime hours: 2 hours * $27.00/hour = $54.00 per day

Next, calculate her weekly earnings:
- Weekly earnings: (Regular hours * Regular wage) + (Overtime hours * Overtime wage)
- Weekly earnings = (8 hours * $18.00/hour) + (2 hours * $27.00/hour)
- Weekly earnings = $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00

Therefore, the answer is $198.00.

To calculate Tina's earnings from working 10 hours, we first need to determine that days work:

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hour(s) } \times  \text{hourly rate} = 8 \times 18 \]

\[ \text{Overtime pay} = 2 \text{ hour(s) } \times (hourly rate + 1/2 hourly rate) \]

We then add the total earnings for regular and overtime hours to get the grand total:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Regular pay} + \text{Overtime pay} \]

Now we calculate the numbers:

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \times 18 = 144 \]

\[ \text{Overtime pay} = 2 \times (18 + 0.5) = 2 \times 18.5 = 37 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 144 + 37 = \$181 \]

To calculate Tina's total earnings, we need to separate her regular pay and her overtime pay.

### Regular Pay:
- Hours worked per day: 10 hours
- Regular pay rate: $18.00

Regular pay for one day = 10 hours * $18.00/hour = $180.00

### Overtime Pay:
1. Overtime hours per day: 2 hours (since 10 - 8 = 2)
2. Overtime pay rate: $18.00 + 1/2 * $18.00 = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00

Overtime pay for one day = 2 hours * $27.00/hour = $54.00

### Total Pay:
Regular pay for 5 days + Overtime pay for 5 days
= $180.00 (5 days) + $54.00 (5 days) = $234.00

So, Tina makes a total of $234.00.

First, we need to calculate Tina's regular pay for working 8 hours at $18.00 per hour for 8 hours.

Regular pay = Regular hours * Hourly wage
Regular pay = 8 * $18.00
Regular pay = $144.00

Next, we calculate her overtime pay. Tina works a total of 10 hours, so she has 2 hours of overtime.

Overtime pay = Overtime hours * (Hourly wage + 1/2 * Hourly wage)
Overtime pay = 2 * ($18.00 + 1/2 * $18.00)
Overtime pay = 2 * ($18.00 + $9.00)
Overtime pay = 2 * $27.00
Overtime pay = $54.00

Now, we add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total pay for a day.

Total pay for a day = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Total pay for a day = $144.00 + $54.00
Total pay for a day = $198.00

Finally, we calculate her total pay for 5 days.

Total pay for 5 days = Total pay for a day * 5
Total pay for 5 days = $198.00 * 5
Total pay for 5 days = $990.00

Therefore, Tina makes $990.00 in total for a 5-day workweek.

To calculate Tina's earnings, we need to consider her regular hours and her overtime hours. Her regular rate is $18.00 per hour, and her overtime rate is $18.00 + 1/2 * $18.00.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in a day:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Regular hours} + \text{Overtime hours} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 8 + 2 \times \text{Overtime hours} \]
where \(\text{Overtime hours}\) are hours worked more than 8.

Next, we can calculate her overtime hours needed for 10 hours of work:
\[ \text{Overtime hours} = \text{Total hours} - 8 \]

Now, let's calculate her overtime pay rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 18.00 + 0.5 \times 18.00 \]

Finally, let's calculate her earnings for the 5-day week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Overtime rate} \]

Let's plug these formulas into our problem:
\[ \text{Total hours} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Overtime hours} = 10 - 8 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 18.00 + 0.5 \times 18.00 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 10 \times \text{Overtime rate} \]

Let's calculate the overtime rate first, then multiply by the total hours worked to get the total earnings.
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 18.00 + 0.5 \times 18.00 \]
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 18.00 + 0.5 \times 18.00 \]
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 18.00 + 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 27.00 \]

Thus, her total earnings for the 5-day week are:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 10 \times 27.00 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$270.00 \]

Therefore, the final answer is \$270.00.

First, we need to calculate Tina's regular and overtime wages. For the first 8 hours, she earns the regular wage, which is $18.00 an hour. For the next 2 hours (since she works 10 hours total), she earns overtime wages, which are her hourly wage plus half her hourly wage, i.e., $18.00 + ($18.00 / 2).

After calculating both parts, we can sum them to find the total amount she earns.

Regular wage for 8 hours: 8 hours × $18.00/hour = $144.00
Overtime wages for 2 hours: 2 hours × ($18.00 + $9.00) = $2 × $27.00 = $54.00

To calculate Tina's total earnings, we need to consider her regular and overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation**: For the first 8 hours, she earns her regular wage.
   - Regular wage per hour = $18.00
   - Regular hours = 8
   - Regular pay = 8 hours * $18.00/hour = $144.00

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation**: For the hours worked beyond the 8th hour, she earns her regular wage plus 1/2 her regular wage.
   - Overtime wage per hour = $18.00 + ($18.00 * 1/2) = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00
   - Overtime hours = 10 - 8 = 2 hours
   - Overtime pay = 2 hours * $27.00/hour = $54.00

3. **Total Pay Calculation**: Sum of regular pay and overtime pay.
   - Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00

Therefore, based on the given information, Tina would make $198.00 in total.

Reasoning:

To determine how much money Tina makes, we need to calculate her earnings both for regular hours and overtime hours. Regular hours are any hours worked within the standard 8-hour shift. Overtime hours are any hours worked beyond the 8, which are paid at a rate of her regular wage plus 1/2 of her regular wage.

Calculating:
- Regular hours: 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours
- Overtime hours: 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours

Total regular hours: 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours
Total overtime hours: 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours

Regular earnings: 40 hours * $18.00/hour = $720.00
Overtime earnings: 2 hours * ($18.00 + $9.00) = 2 hours * $27.00/hour

Total earnings: $720.00 + ($27.00 * 2) = $720.00 + $54.00

Tina makes a total of $774.00.

To calculate how much Tina makes in total, we need to consider both her regular hours and her overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:** Tina works her regular hours at her base salary.
2. **Overtime Hours:** Any hours worked beyond 8 hours are considered overtime and are paid at her base rate plus half of her base rate.

First, let's calculate her regular earnings:

- Tina works 8 hours as regular.
- Regular pay rate = $18.00/hour.

Regular earnings:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$18.00/\text{hour} = \$144.00 \]

Next, let's calculate her overtime earnings. She works 2 hours of overtime (10 hours total - 8 hours regular).

- Overtime rate is calculated as her base pay plus half of her base pay.
- Overtime pay rate = \( \$18.00 + \frac{\$18.00}{2} \).

To find half of her base pay:
\[ \frac{\$18.00}{2} = \$9.00 \]

So, the overtime pay rate is:
\[ \$18.00 + \$9.00 = \$27.00 \]

Overtime earnings:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$27.00/\text{hour} = \$54.00 \]

Now, add her regular and overtime earnings to find the total earnings:
\[ Regular \ earnings + Overtime \ earnings = \$144.00 + \$54.00 = \$198.00 \]

Therefore, Tina makes a total of \$198.00.

To determine how much money Tina makes, we need to calculate her pay for 5 days based on her shift durations.

1. Calculate her daily pay excluding overtime:
   - Tina works 10 hours per day.
   - Her regular pay rate is $18.00 per hour.
   - Her regular pay for 10 hours is \(10 \text{ hours} \times \$18.00/\text{hour} = \$180.00\).

2. Determine the overtime pay:
   - Since she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime.
   - Overtime pay is \(1/2\) her regular hourly wage plus her regular hourly wage.
   - Overtime pay rate = \((1/2) \times \$18.00 + \$18.00 = \$9.00 + \$18.00 = \$27.00\) per hour.

3. Calculate her overtime pay for 10 hours:
   - Overtime hours = \(10 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}\).
   - Overtime pay = \(2 \text{ hours} \times \$27.00/\text{hour} = \$54.00\).

4. Calculate her total pay for 5 days:
   - Total pay for daily pay: \(10 \text{ hours} \times \$18.00/\text{hour} = \$180.00\).
   - Total pay for overtime: \(2 \text{ hours} \times \$27.00/\text{hour} = \$54.00\).
   - Total pay for 5 days = Total pay for daily pay + Total pay for overtime.
   - Total pay for 5 days = \(\$180.00 + \$54.00 = \$234.00\).

Therefore, Tina makes \(\$234.00\) in total for 5 days.
