###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Lao is farming chickens. He can sell each chicken for $1.50. A bag of chicken feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2. Each chicken will need 2 pounds of feed from the time it hatches to the time he sells it. If he makes $65 profit from selling chickens, how many did he sell?

system
Let's break down the problem:

1. Lao earns $1.50 per chicken.
2. To calculate the total profit, we need to find out how much feed each chicken needs and then calculate the total cost of the feed for one chicken.
3. Each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed, and a bag weighs 20 pounds, so each chicken will use one bag of feed.
4. Each bag of feed costs $2.
5. Additionally, Lao makes $1.50 from selling each chicken, so we need to subtract this profit from the total profit to find out how much was spent on chicken feed: $65 - ($1.50 * 65) = $65 - $97.50 = $15.
6. Since each chicken uses one bag of feed, that means he used one bag of feed per chicken. Therefore, he used $15 worth of feed per chicken.
7. Now we can calculate the number of chickens he sold by dividing the total profit spent on feed by the cost of feed per chicken: 15 dollars / $2 per bag per chicken = 7.5 chickens.

Since he can't sell half a chicken, that means he sold 7 chickens.

To determine how many chickens Lao sold, we need to calculate the profit generated from each chicken and then find out how many chickens made up the total profit.

1. Calculate the profit per chicken:
   - Selling price: $1.50 per chicken
   - Cost of feed: 20 pounds * $2/20 pounds = $2
   - Profit per chicken: $1.50 - $2 = -$0.50

   Since the profit is negative, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement or calculations. However, assuming the problem is correctly stated, let's re-evaluate the profit and the total cost.

2. Let's assume the problem meant to say each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed, and the cost of feed is $1 per 20 pounds (which would be more reasonable).
   - Cost of feed: 20 pounds * $1/20 pounds = $1

3. Now, calculate the profit per chicken:
   - Selling price: $1.50 per chicken
   - Cost of feed: $1
   - Profit per chicken: $1.50 - $1 = $0.50

4. Lao makes a profit of $65 from selling chickens.
   - Number of chickens sold = $65 / $0.50 = 130

5. If each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed, then the total feed needed for 130 chickens is 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

6. The cost of 260 pounds of feed is:
   - 260 pounds * $1/20 pounds = $13

7. Therefore, the total cost for producing 130 chickens and selling them is $13.
   - Total revenue = number of chickens * selling price = 130 * $1.50 = $195

8. Since the total cost and revenue are equal ($13 + $65 = $78), it is clear that the problem statement needs to be corrected.

9. Based on the corrected assumptions and calculations:
   - Number of chickens sold = 130

To determine how many chickens Lao sold, we need to consider both the revenue from selling the chickens and the cost of the feed.

1. **Revenue from selling chickens:**
   - Each chicken sells for $1.50.
   - The total revenue is given as $65.

2. **Cost of feed:**
   - Each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed.
   - Each bag of feed weighs 20 pounds but costs $2.
   - The cost per pound of feed is $2 / 20 pounds = $0.10 per pound.
   - Since each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed, the cost for 2 pounds of feed per chicken is $0.10 * 2 = $0.20 per chicken.

3. **Profit from selling chickens:**
   - The profit per chicken is the selling price minus the cost of feed.
   - Selling price of each chicken = $1.50
   - Cost of feed for each chicken = $0.20
   - Profit per chicken = $1.50 - $0.20 = $1.30

4. **Number of chickens sold:**
   - Total profit = $65
   - Profit per chicken = $1.30
   - Number of chickens sold = Total profit / Profit per chicken = $65 / $1.30 = 50

So, Lao sold 50 chickens.

Let's calculate the profit per chicken first:

Profit per chicken = Price per chicken - (Cost per bag of feed * Number of chickens per bag / Number of chickens per bag)

The cost per bag of feed is $2 and each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed, which takes 2 * 20 = 40 pounds of feed per chicken to be fully fed. On average, a chicken needs to grow 40 pounds of feed to be fully fed, which means it takes it 10 days of feed, one bag, and one chicken.

Profit per chicken = $1.50 - ($2 / 10) = $1.50 - $0.20 = $1.30

Now, we need to find out how many chickens Lao sold to make $65 profit. We can use the formula:

Number of chickens = Profit / Profit per chicken

Number of chickens = $65 / $1.30 ≈ 50

So, Lao sold about 50 chickens to make $65 profit.

To determine how many chickens Lao sold, we need to calculate the profit from the chicken feed and the profit from selling the chickens.

First, calculate the profit from selling chickens:
- Lao sells each chicken for $1.50.
- He made a total profit of $65 from selling chickens.
Thus, the number of chickens sold = Total profit from selling chickens / Profit per chicken = $65 / $1.50 = 43.33. Since he cannot sell a fraction of a chicken, he sold 43 chickens.

Next, calculate the total amount of chicken feed needed. Each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed from hatching to the time it is sold.
- Number of chickens = 43.
- Each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed.
Therefore, total feed needed = Number of chickens * Feed per chicken = 43 * 2 = 86 pounds.

Now, calculate the total cost of the feed:
- Each bag of feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2.
- Total feed needed = 86 pounds.
The number of bags needed = Total feed / Feed per bag = 86 / 20 = 4.3. Since he cannot buy a fraction of a bag, he needs to buy 5 bags of feed.

Therefore, Lao bought 5 bags of feed at a cost of 5 * $2 = $10.

Finally, calculate the profit from selling the chickens:
- Profit per chicken = $1.50.
- Lao sold 43 chickens.
Thus, total profit from chickens = 43 * $1.50 = $64.50.

Check if the total profit matches the given profit:
- Total profit from selling chickens = $64.50.
- Total cost of feed = $10.
Therefore, the total cost of feed should be subtracted from the total profit to check the consistency.
- $64.50 - $10 = $54.50.

There is a discrepancy of $0.50 ($65 - $64.50), possibly due to rounding errors, but it matches the consistency of the problem's context.

Lao sold 43 chickens.

To find out how many chickens Lao sold, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost per chicken for feed:

- Each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed.
- A bag of feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2.
- So, each chicken’s feed costs \( \frac{2}{20} = \$0.10 \).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling each chicken:

- Each chicken is sold for $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the profit per chicken:

- Profit per chicken = Selling price - Feed cost
- Profit per chicken = $1.50 - $0.10
- Profit per chicken = $1.40

With a total profit of $65, we can now find out how many chickens were sold:

- Total profit / Profit per chicken = Number of chickens sold
- 65 / 1.40 = 46.428571

Lao can only sell whole chickens, so we round down to the nearest whole number:

- Number of chickens sold = 46

To determine how many chickens Lao sold to make a profit of $65, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract the cost of the feed.

First, let's find the revenue from selling the chickens. He sells each chicken for $1.50, and we need to determine how many chickens he sold to make a $65 profit.

Let the number of chickens sold be \( x \). The revenue from selling the chickens is:
\[ 1.50x \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the feed. Each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed, and Lao has 20 pounds of feed per bag. Since each bag costs $2, the cost of the feed per chicken is:
\[ \frac{2}{20} \times 2 = 0.20 \text{ dollars per chicken} \]

The total cost of the feed for \( x \) chickens is:
\[ 0.20x \text{ dollars} \]

Lao's total cost is the cost of the feed plus the cost of selling the chickens:
\[ 2 + 0.20x \]

Lao's total revenue is the revenue from selling the chickens:
\[ 1.50x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 1.50x - (2 + 0.20x) = 1.50x - 2 - 0.20x = 1.30x - 2 \]

We know that the profit is $65:
\[ 1.30x - 2 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 1.30x - 2 = 65 \]
\[ 1.30x = 67 \]
\[ x = \frac{67}{1.30} \]
\[ x = 51.5384615 \]

Since the number of chickens must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[ x = 51 \]

So, Lao sold 51 chickens.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Profit per chicken**: 
   - He sells each chicken for $1.50.
   - The cost of feed for each chicken is $2 for the first 20 pounds (20 - 2 pounds per chicken = 18 pounds).
   - The total feed required is 38 pounds (18 pounds for feeding plus 2 pounds at hatching).
   - Cost of 38 pounds of feed is (38/20)*$2 = $3.80.
   - Net profit per chicken = $1.50 - $3.80 = -$2.30. Since he's incurring a loss on each chicken, we'll consider this as a negative profit.

2. **Profit per chicken as a percentage of cost:**
   - Net profit per chicken = -$2.30 (negative profit).
   - Cost per chicken = $2 (feed cost) 
   - Profit as a percentage = -$2.30 / $2 * 100% = -115%.

3. **Total profit from all chickens:**
   - Total profit from all chickens = $65
   - Total number of chickens sold = Total profit / (Net profit per chicken as a percentage of cost) 
   - Total number of chickens sold = $65 / (-115%) * 100 = $65 / -1 = 0

4. **Profit calculation for each non-sold chicken:**
   - For non-sold chickens, the cost of feed remains the same ($2 per chicken).
   - Each chicken needs feed for 18 pounds.
   - Total feed cost for non-sold chickens = $2 * (Total number of non-sold chickens).
   - Net profit for each non-sold chicken = -$2 * (Total number of non-sold chickens).
   - For non-sold chickens to break even, net profit must equal zero.
   - -$2 * (Total number of non-sold chickens) - $2 = $0.
   - Solving for the number of non-sold chickens: (Total number of non-sold chickens) = -$2 / -2 = 1.

5. **Total number of chickens sold:**
   - Total number of chickens = Total number of non-sold chickens (1) + Number of sold chickens.
   - Total number of chickens = 1 + 46 = 47

Therefore, Lao sold 47 chickens.

3. Each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed.
4. Lao makes a profit of $65 from selling chickens.
5. We need to find out how many chickens he sold.

First, let's calculate the profit per chicken meal (2 pounds of feed):
\( \text{Feed cost per chicken meal} = \frac{\$2}{20 \text{ pounds}} = \$0.10 \text{ per pound} \)
\( \text{Revenue per chicken meal} = \$1.50 \)
\( \text{Cost per chicken meal} = \frac{\$0.10}{2 \text{ pounds}} = \$0.05 \text{ per pound} \)

Now, let's calculate the profit per chicken meal:
\( \text{Profit per chicken meal} = \$1.50 - \$0.05 = \$1.45 \)

Lao makes a profit of $65. So, to find out how many chickens he sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per chicken meal:
\( \text{Number of chickens sold} = \frac{\$65}{\$1.45 \text{ per chicken meal}} = 45 \)

So, Lao sold 45 chickens.

To determine how many chickens Lao sold, we first calculate his total revenue from selling the chickens. Since he makes $65 profit and each chicken is sold for $1.50, the revenue from selling the chickens is:
\[ 65 \div 1.50 = 43.3333 \]
Since he can't sell a fraction of a chicken, he sold 43 chickens.

Next, we need to determine the cost of feeding the chickens. Each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed, and if he sells the chicken after 12 weeks (from hatching to the sale price), he would need:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds} \]
Since a bag of feed weighs 20 pounds, he needs:
\[ 24 \div 20 = 1.2 \]
bags of feed, costing:
\[ 1.2 \times 2 = 2.4 \text{ dollars} \]
This means he spent $2.40 on feed. Since he makes $1.50 for each chicken sold, he makes:
\[ 43 \times 1.50 = 64.5 \text{ dollars} \]
Since he only spent $2.40 on feed, his profit from selling the chickens and not the feed costs is:
\[ 64.5 - 2.4 = 62.1 \text{ dollars} \]
However, the problem states he makes $65 profit, so he must have sold the chickens for $65, not just $64.50. Therefore, he must have sold more than 43 chickens. The number of additional chickens he sold is:
\[ 65 - 64.5 = 0.5 \]
Since he can't sell half a chicken, he must have sold 0.5 more chickens, meaning he sold 44 chickens.

First, let's calculate the cost of feed for one chicken. Since each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed and costs $2 per 20 pounds, the cost of feed for one chicken is $1 (because 20 pounds divided by 20 pounds equals $1 per chicken).

Next, let's calculate the cost of feed for all the chickens. Since there are 100 chickens (as the cost is $65 profit divided by the profit per chicken), the total cost of feed for all the chickens is $100 (100 chickens times $1 per chicken).

Now, let's determine the total revenue from selling the chickens. Since each chicken is sold for $1.50, the total revenue from selling all the chickens is $150 (100 chickens times $1.50 per chicken).

To find the number of chickens sold, we subtract the total cost of feed from the total revenue:
$150 (total revenue) - $100 (total cost of feed) = $50.

Since each chicken costs $1 to feed, the number of chickens sold is $50. Therefore, Lao sold 50 chickens.

To determine how many chickens Lao sold, we need to calculate his total revenue, subtract the cost of the feed, and then solve for the number of chickens sold.

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the chickens:**
   - He sells each chicken for $1.50.
   - Let's denote the number of chickens sold as \( x \).
   - Total revenue = \( 1.50 \times x \).

2. **Determine the total feed cost:**
   - Each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed.
   - A bag of feed weighs 20 pounds.
   - The number of chickens is equal to the number of bags of feed used, which is \( \frac{x}{10} \) because each bag feeds 10 chickens (since \( x \) chickens need \( \frac{x}{10} \) bags of feed).
   - Each bag costs $2.
   - Total feed cost = \( 2 \times \frac{x}{10} = 0.20x \).

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Given the profit is $65, we can write the equation:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to figure out the profit per chicken:
   Profit per chicken = $1.50

2) Chickens need 2 pounds of feed each. At $2 per bag of 20 pounds, the cost of feed for one chicken is:
   Cost of feed per chicken = $2 / 20 pounds * 2 pounds = $0.20

3) The profit per chicken (selling price - cost of feed) is:
   Profit per chicken = $1.50 - $0.20 = $1.30

4) Lao makes a total profit of $65 from selling chickens. To find out how many chickens he sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per chicken:

To determine how many chickens Lao sold, we first need to calculate the profit per chicken. Each chicken sold results in a profit of $1.50.

Next, we need to calculate the profit related to feed cost. Each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed, and each bag of feed costs $2. Therefore, the profit from feed for each chicken is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds of feed} \times \$2 \text{ per bag} = \$4 \text{ profit per chicken for feed} \]

Now, we need to set up an equation to find the number of chickens \( x \). The profit from selling the chickens is the selling price of each chicken times the number of chickens sold, minus the cost of the feed. The equation is:
