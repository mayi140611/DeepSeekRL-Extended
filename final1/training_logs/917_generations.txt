To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of recyclable cans and bottles consumed by the guests.

1. For soda cans:
   - Half of the 90 guests drank soda.
   - Therefore, the number of guests who drank soda is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45 \).
   - Since each guest who drank soda consumed 1 can, the number of soda cans collected is 45.

2. For sparkling water bottles:
   - One-third of the 90 guests drank sparkling water.
   - Therefore, the number of guests who drank sparkling water is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).
   - Since each guest who drank sparkling water consumed 1 bottle, the number of sparkling water bottles collected is 30.

3. For juice bottles:
   - Four-fifths of the juice bottles were consumed.
   - Since each guest who drank juice consumed 1 juice bottle, the number of juice bottles consumed is \( \frac{4}{5} \times 50 = 40 \).
   - Since each juice bottle is recyclable, the number of recyclable juice bottles collected is 40.

Adding these together gives us the total number of recyclable cans and bottles collected:
   - Soda cans: 45
   - Sparkling water bottles: 30
   - Recyclable juice bottles: 40
   - Total: 45 + 30 + 40 = 115

So, the total number of recyclable cans and bottles collected is 115.

First, let's determine how many guests drank each type of beverage:

- The number of guests who drank soda is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45 \).
- The number of guests who drank sparkling water is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).
- The number of guests who drank juice is \( \frac{4}{5} \times 90 = 72 \).

Next, we calculate the number of each type of recyclable container used:

- The number of soda cans used is \( 45 \times 1 = 45 \).
- The number of plastic bottles of sparkling water used is \( 30 \times 1 = 30 \).
- The number of glass bottles of juice used is \( 72 \times 1 = 72 \).

Now, we add these numbers to find the total number of recyclable containers collected:

- Total containers = soda containers + sparkling water bottles + juice bottles
- Total containers = \( 45 + 30 + 72 = 147 \).

So, the total number of recyclable cans and bottles collected is 147.

To determine the number of recyclable cans and bottles collected, we first need to calculate the number of guests who drank each type of beverage and then find out how many cans and bottles were used for each.

1. Calculate the number of guests who drank soda:
   \[
   \text{Number of guests who drank soda} = \frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45
   \]
   Since each soda can weighs 16 ounces, and there are 90 people, we assume 90 cans were consumed. If we had 50 cans, then 45/50 * 90 = 81 cans were used in total.

2. Calculate the number of guests who drank sparkling water:
   \[
   \text{Number of guests who drank sparkling water} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 plastic bottles of sparkling water were consumed. If we had 50 bottles, we can assume 50 bottles were used.

3. Calculate the number of guests who drank juice:
   \[
   \text{Number of guests who drank juice} = \frac{4}{5} \times 90 = 72
   \]
   So, 72 glass bottles of juice were consumed. If we had 50 bottles, then 50 bottles were used.

Now, we can calculate the total number of recyclable cans and bottles:

- Total soda cans used: 81 (from guests who drank soda)
- Total sparkling water bottles used: 50 (from guests who drank sparkling water)
- Total juice bottles used: 50 (from guests who drank juice)

Total recyclable cans and bottles collected:
\[
81 + 50 + 50 = 181
\]

First, we need to determine how many guests drank each type of beverage. We know that one-half of the guests drank soda, one-third drank sparkling water, and four-fifths of the juices were consumed. Since the total number of guests at the picnic is 90:

1. Number of guests who drank soda = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45 \)
2. Number of guests who drank sparkling water = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \)
3. Number of guests who drank juice = \( \frac{4}{5} \times 90 = 72 \)

Next, we need to calculate how many cans and bottles of each type were consumed. Since there were 50 cans and 50 bottles of each type, the total consumed cans and bottles for each beverage are:

1. Cans of soda = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 90 \times 50 = 4500 \)
2. Bottles of sparkling water = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 \times 50 = 1500 \)
3. Bottles of juice = \( \frac{4}{5} \times 90 \times 50 = 3600 \)

Finally, we add the consumed cans and bottles from each type to get the total number of recyclable cans and bottles collected:

1. Total recyclable cans and bottles = \( 4500 + 1500 + 3600 = 9600 \)

To find out how many recyclable cans and bottles were collected, we need to determine how many guests drank soda, sparkling water, and juice, and then multiply by the number of cans and bottles consumed based on their type.

For soda, the number of guests who drank soda is half of the total number of guests, which is \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \). Since each guest drinks one can of soda, the total number of soda cans collected is \( 45 \).

For sparkling water, the number of guests who drank sparkling water is a third of the total number of guests, which is \( \frac{90}{3} = 30 \). Since each guest drinks one bottle of sparkling water, the total number of sparkling water bottles collected is \( 30 \).

For juice, the number of guests who drank juice is four-fifths of the total number of guests, which is \( \frac{90 \times 4}{5} = 72 \). Since each guest drinks one glass of juice, the total number of juice bottles collected is \( 72 \).

Adding these amounts together, we get the total number of recyclable cans and bottles collected:

Total = Soda cans + Sparkling water bottles + Juice bottles
Total = 45 + 30 + 72 = 147

Therefore, the total number of recyclable cans and bottles collected is 147.

To find out how many recyclable cans and bottles were collected, we need to calculate the number of each type of beverage that was drunk by the guests.

For soda:
- One-half of 90 guests drank soda, so 90/2 = 45 guests drank soda.
- Since there were 50 soda cans, 45 guests drank soda, meaning 45 cans were consumed.
- Therefore, 45 recyclable cans were collected from soda.

For sparkling water:
- One-third of 90 guests drank sparkling water, so 90/3 = 30 guests drank sparkling water.
- Since there were 50 plastic bottles, 30 guests drank sparkling water, meaning 30 bottles were consumed.
- Therefore, 30 recyclable bottles were collected from sparkling water.

For juice:
- Four-fifths of the juices were consumed, so 50/5 = 10 glass bottles of juice were consumed.
- Therefore, 10 recyclable glass bottles were collected from juice.

Adding up all the recyclables, we get:
- 45 cans from soda
- 30 bottles from sparkling water
- 10 bottles from juice

   - Total bottles: 50
   - One-third of the guests drank sparkling water.
   - Number of guests who drank sparkling water: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \)
   - Sparkling water bottles collected: \( \frac{30}{90} \times 50 = \frac{30 \times 50}{90} = \frac{1500}{90} = \frac{50}{3} = 16 \) (approximately 16 bottles)

3. **Juice:**
   - Total bottles: 50
   - Four-fifths of the juices were consumed.
   - Number of juice bottles consumed: \( \frac{4}{5} \times 50 = 40 \)
   - Juice bottles collected: \( \frac{40}{90} \times 50 = \frac{40 \times 50}{90} = \frac{2000}{90} = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22 \) (approximately 22 bottles)

In total, the recyclable cans and bottles collected are:

To find out the total number of recyclable cans and bottles collected, we need to calculate the number of each beverage consumed and then sum these values.

1. **Soda**: 
   - Total soda cans = 50
   - Guests who drank soda = 1/2 of 90, which is 45
   - Therefore, the number of soda cans consumed = 45

2. **Sparkling Water**:
   - Total plastic bottles of sparkling water = 50
   - Guests who drank sparkling water = 1/3 of 90, which is 30
   - Therefore, the number of plastic bottles of sparkling water consumed = 30

3. **Juice**:
   - Total glass bottles of juice = 50
   - Guests who drank juice = 4/5 of 90, which is 72
   - Therefore, the number of glass bottles of juice consumed = 72

Now, we sum the consumed beverages:
   - Total Recyclable Cans and Bottles = Soda cans + Plastic bottles of sparkling water + Glass bottles of juice
