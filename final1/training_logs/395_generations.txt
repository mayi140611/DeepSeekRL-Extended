###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Utopia National Park hosted 30,000 elephants on Friday night. The next morning, there was a 4-hour elephant exodus out of the park, at a constant rate of 2,880 elephants/hour. Over the next 7-hour period, new elephants entered the park at a constant rate. If the final number of elephants in the park was 28,980, at what rate did the new elephants enter the park?

To determine the rate at which new elephants entered the park, we first need to calculate the net change in the number of elephants over the given periods.

1. **Initial number of elephants**: 30,000.
2. **Number of elephants exiled**: 4 hours * 2,880 elephants/hour = 11,520 elephants.
3. **Number of elephants left after exodus**: 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 elephants.

Next, the park gains new elephants over the next 7-hour period:

4. **Final number of elephants**: 28,980.
5. **Number of elephants added**: Final number - Number left after exodus = 28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500 elephants.

We know the rate at which the new elephants entered the park (since the net influx equals the difference in the number of elephants):

6. **Rate of new elephants entering**: 10,500 elephants / 7 hours = 1,500 elephants/hour.

Initially, there were 30,000 elephants in the park. A 4-hour exodus resulted in the park having:

\[ 30,000 - 2,880 \times 4 = 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \]

elephants left the park. Therefore, the number of new elephants that entered the park over the next 7-hour period is:

\[ 28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500 \]

Since the new elephants entered at a constant rate, the rate at which the new elephants entered the park is:

\[ \frac{10,500 \text{ elephants}}{7 \text{ hours}} = 1,500 \text{ elephants/hour} \]

The total number of elephants that left the park in 4 hours is \(4 \times 2,880 = 11,520\). The initial number of elephants minus the number that left is \(30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480\). The final number of elephants is 28,980, so the number of new elephants that entered the park is \(28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500\). This number of new elephants entered over 7 hours, so the rate at which new elephants entered the park is \(10,500 \div 7 = 1,500\) elephants/hour.

Initially, there are 30,000 elephants in Utopia National Park. Over the next morning, 4 hours later, 2,880 elephants exit the park at a constant rate of 2,880 elephants/hour. The remaining number of elephants after the exodus is:
\[ 30000 - (2880 \times 4) = 30000 - 11520 = 18480. \]
This means that 18,480 elephants entered the park the following day. Over a period of 7 hours, the number of new elephants that entered is:
\[ \frac{18480}{7} = 2640. \]
Therefore, the rate at which new elephants entered the park was 2640 elephants/hour.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Elephants**: Initially, the park had 30,000 elephants.
2. **Exodus of Elephants**: Over 4 hours, 2,880 elephants left the park at a constant rate of 2,880 elephants/hour.
   - The number of elephants that left in 4 hours is \( 2,880 \times 4 = 11,520 \).
   - Therefore, the number of elephants remaining after the exodus is \( 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \).
3. **Entrance of New Elephants**: It took 7 hours for new elephants to enter the park.
   - Let the rate of new elephants entering the park be \( x \) elephants/hour.
   - Over 7 hours, the number of new elephants entering the park is \( 7x \).
   - After 7 hours, the total number of elephants in the park is the initial number plus the number of new elephants entering, which is \( 18,480 + 7x \).
4. **Final Number of Elephants**: According to the problem, the final number of elephants in the park was 28,980.
   - Therefore, we have the equation: \( 18,480 + 7x = 28,980 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 18,480 + 7x = 28,980 \]
\[ 7x = 28,980 - 18,480 \]
\[ 7x = 10,500 \]
\[ x = \frac{10,500}{7} \]
\[ x = 1,500 \]

So, the rate at which new elephants entered the park is 1,500 elephants/hour.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Friday night, there were 30,000 elephants in the park. There was a 4-hour exodus of elephants at a rate of 2,880 elephants per hour. So, the total number of elephants that left the park during this period was:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} \times 2,880 \text{ elephants/hour} = 11,520 \text{ elephants}
   \]
   After the exodus, the number of elephants remaining in the park was:
   \[
   30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \text{ elephants}
   \]

2. The new elephants entered the park over the next 7 hours. The final number of elephants in the park was 28,980, so the number of new elephants that entered the park is:
   \[
   28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500 \text{ elephants}
   \]

3. Since the new elephants entered over 7 hours, the rate at which these new elephants entered the park can be calculated as:

To find the rate at which new elephants entered the park, we first need to determine how many elephants left and how many entered the park over the given period.

1. Calculate the number of elephants that left the park:
\[ \text{Elephants left} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 2880 \, \text{elephants/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 11520 \, \text{elephants} \]

2. Calculate the number of elephants that entered the park over the next 7 hours:
\[ \text{Number of elephants entered} = \text{Final number} - \text{Initial number} = 28980 - 30000 = -920 \, \text{elephants} \]

3. Correct the calculation for elephants entered:
\[ \text{Number of elephants entered} = \text{Final number} + \text{Elephants left} = 28980 + 11520 = 40500 \, \text{elephants} \]

4. Calculate the rate of new elephants entering the park:
\[ \text{Rate of new elephants entering} = \frac{\text{Number of elephants entered}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{40500 \, \text{elephants}}{7 \, \text{hours}} \approx 5785.71 \, \text{elephants/hour} \]

To find the rate at which the new elephants entered the park, we need to calculate how many elephants left and how many entered over the given timeframe, then determine the rate based on the final number of elephants.

1. Calculate the number of elephants that left the park during the 4-hour exodus. This is 4 hours * 2,880 elephants/hour = 11,520 elephants.
2. The final number of elephants in the park is 28,980, and initially there were 30,000 elephants. So, the number of elephants entering minus the number of elephants leaving should equal the final number of elephants: 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 elephants entering.
3. The rate at which the new elephants entered the park is the number of elephants entering divided by the number of hours: 18,480 elephants / 7 hours = 2,640 elephants/hour.

</reasoning>
<answer>
2640
</answer>
<reasoning>
To determine the rate at which new elephants entered the park, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. The initial number of elephants in the park is 30,000.
2. Over a 4-hour period, 11,520 elephants left the park.

Next, we need to find out how many new elephants entered the park during the same period. First, we calculate the net change in the number of elephants after 4 hours of the 4-hour exodus:

\[ 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \]

This net change represents the number of new elephants that entered the park during that 4-hour period. After 4 hours, the final count of elephants in the park is given as 28,980. To find the number of elephants that entered the park after these 4 hours, we subtract the initial number of elephants from the final count:

\[ 28,980 - 30,000 = -1020 \]

Since the net change in the number of elephants over these 4 hours was negative, it implies that during this period, elephants were leaving the park rather than entering. Therefore, we need to correct our approach. The correct interpretation is that new elephants entered the park to make up for the 11,520 elephants who left the park. 

So, the number of new elephants that entered the park is:

\[ 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \]

Now, we know the number of elephants entering the park over the next 7-hour period is 18,480. To find the rate of the new elephants entering the park, we divide the number of elephants by the number of hours:

\[ \frac{18,480 \text{ elephants}}{7 \text{ hours}} = 2,640 \text{ elephants/hour} \]

Thus, the rate at which the new elephants entered the park is 2,640 elephants/hour.

The initial number of elephants is 30,000. During the 4-hour period, 2,880 elephants left the park. So the number of elephants left after these 4 hours is \(30,000 - 2,880 = 27,120\).

The next 7-hour period, new elephants enter the park. Let \(x\) be the rate at which new elephants enter the park in elephants per hour. So after the 7-hour period, the number of elephants in the park is \(27,120 + 7x\).

According to the problem, the final number of elephants is 28,980. So we can set up the equation:
\[27,120 + 7x = 28,980\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[7x = 28,980 - 27,120\]
\[7x = 1,860\]
\[x = \frac{1,860}{7} = 265.7142857...\]

So, the new elephants enter the park at a rate of approximately 265.71 elephants per hour.

265.71
</answer>
<reasoning>
We start with the initial number of elephants, 30,000. Over the 4-hour period, 2,880 elephants leave the park, leaving 27,120 elephants. The new elephants entering the park over the next 7 hours resulted in the final number of elephants being 28,980. Therefore, the number of new elephants entering the park is:
\[28,980 - 27,120 = 1,860\]

Since these new elephants entered over a 7-hour period at a constant rate, we divide the total number of new elephants by the number of hours:
\[ \frac{1,860}{7} \approx 265.7142857\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the rate of new elephants entering the park is 266 elephants per hour.

To find the rate at which new elephants entered the park, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of elephants that left the park during the 4-hour exodus.
2. Subtract the number of elephants that left from the initial number to find out how many arrived.
3. Calculate the rate at which new elephants entered the park over the next 7-hour period.

Let's start with step 1. The rate of the exodus is 2,880 elephants per hour, and it lasts for 4 hours:
\[ 2880 \times 4 = 11520 \text{ elephants} \]
So, 11,520 elephants left the park.

Next, for step 2, we subtract the number of elephants that left from the initial number to find the number of new elephants that arrived:
\[ 30000 - 11520 = 18480 \text{ elephants} \]

Finally, for step 3, we calculate the rate at which new elephants entered the park over the next 7-hour period. We know the number of new elephants that arrived and the number of hours they arrived over, so the rate is:
\[ \frac{18480 \text{ elephants}}{7 \text{ hours}} = 2640 \text{ elephants/hour} \]

The exodus of elephants took 4 hours at a rate of 2,880 elephants/hour, so the total number of elephants that left the park was:

\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 2,880 \text{ elephants/hour} = 11,520 \text{ elephants} \]

The final number of elephants in the park was 28,980, so the difference between the initial number of elephants and the final number is:

\[ 30,000 - 28,980 = 1,020 \text{ elephants} \]

This means that during the 7-hour period when new elephants entered the park, the total number of elephants that entered was:

\[ 1,020 \text{ elephants} + 11,520 \text{ elephants (that left)} = 12,540 \text{ elephants} \]

Since the new elephants entered during 7 hours, the rate at which new elephants entered the park was:

From Friday night to morning, the total number of elephants in the park was 30,000. During the 4-hour exodus, the number of elephants decreased by \(4 \times 2880 = 11520\) elephants. Therefore, the number of elephants before the exodus was \(30000 - 11520 = 18480\).

This means that over the next 7 hours, 18480 - 28980 = -10,500 elephants entered the park. However, since this is a theoretical calculation of what would happen, we need to consider the possibility that some of these elephants had not entered by morning. Therefore, the elephants that entered the park during the 7 hours could be:

\[11520 + |10500| - 18480 = 11520 + 10500 - 18480 = 3120\]

To find the rate at which the new elephants entered the park, we divide the number of elephants that entered by the number of hours they were in the park:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3120}{7} = 445.7142857 \approx 446 \text{ elephants/hour} \]

However, 445.7142857 is not a whole number, so we must reconsider the calculation. The correct approach is to realize that the number of new elephants that entered the park must be equal to the deficit in the elephant count, which is 10,500, over the 7 hours. Thus:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{10500}{7} = 1500 \text{ elephants/hour} \]

To determine the rate at which the new elephants entered the park, we need to find out how many elephants entered the park from Friday night to the next morning and then subtract the number of elephants that left the park. Finally, we will add this to the initial number of elephants to find out the final population.

First, calculate the number of elephants that left the park from Friday night to the next morning:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 2,880 \text{ elephants/hour} = 11,520 \text{ elephants} \]

The initial number of elephants is 30,000. After the exodus, the number of elephants in the park is:
\[ 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \text{ elephants} \]

Let \( r \) be the rate at which new elephants entered the park. Over the next 7 hours, the number of elephants entering the park is:
\[ 7r = 28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500 \text{ elephants} \]

To find \( r \), solve the equation:

The initial number of elephants in the park was 30,000. After the exodus, the number of elephants left the park:

\[ 30,000 \text{ elephants} - 11,520 \text{ elephants} = 18,480 \text{ elephants} \]

The final number of elephants in the park was 28,980. Let \( r \) be the rate at which new elephants entered the park. Over the next 7-hour period, the number of elephants that entered the park was:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times r \text{ elephants/hour} \]

So after these 7 hours, the number of elephants would be:

To determine the rate at which new elephants entered the park, we start by calculating the number of elephants that left the park during the 4-hour exodus. The rate of departure is 2,880 elephants per hour, so in 4 hours, the number of elephants that left is:

\[ 2880 \text{ elephants/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 11520 \text{ elephants} \]

The initial number of elephants in the park was 30,000. After 4 hours, the number of elephants that left the park was 11,520. Therefore, the number of elephants that entered the park during the next 7-hour period is:

\[ 30000 - 11520 = 18480 \]

Let \( R \) be the rate at which new elephants entered the park in elephants per hour. The number of elephants that entered the park in the next 7-hour period is:

\[ 7R \text{ elephants} \]

We know that the final number of elephants in the park is 28,980. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 18480 + 7R = 28980 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 7R = 28980 - 18480 \]
\[ 7R = 10500 \]
\[ R = \frac{10500}{7} \]
\[ R = 1500 \]

So, the rate at which new elephants entered the park is 1,500 elephants per hour.
