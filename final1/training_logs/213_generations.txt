system
Mike planted 50 seeds in the morning and twice as much in the afternoon, so he planted 50 * 2 = 100 seeds in the afternoon.
Ted planted 20 fewer seeds than Mike in the afternoon, so he planted 100 - 20 = 80 seeds in the afternoon.
In total, the two planted 50 + 100 + 80 = 230 tomato seeds.

Mike planted 50 tomato seeds in the morning and Ted planted twice as much as Mike, so Ted planted \(2 \times 50 = 100\) seeds in the morning. In the afternoon, Mike planted 60 seeds, and Ted planted 20 fewer, so Ted planted \(60 - 20 = 40\) seeds in the afternoon.

The total number of seeds Mike planted is \(50 + 60 = 110\) seeds. The total number of seeds Ted planted is \(100 + 40 = 140\) seeds.

Altogether, they planted \(110 + 140 = 250\) seeds.
