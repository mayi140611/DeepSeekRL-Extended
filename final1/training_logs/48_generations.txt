system
Let's denote the number of digits Carlos memorized as \( C \). According to the problem, Mina memorized six times as many digits of pi as Carlos. So, if Carlos memorized \( C \) digits, Mina memorized \( 6C \) digits. We are given that Mina memorized 24 digits, so we can write:

\[ 6C = 24 \]

To find \( C \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ C = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \]

So, Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi. The problem also states that Sam memorized six more digits of pi than Carlos. Therefore, Sam memorized \( C + 6 \) digits:

\[ \text{Sam's memorized digits} = 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Thus, Sam memorized \(\boxed{10}\) digits of pi.

system
Let \( C \) represent the number of digits Carlos memorized of pi.

According to the problem:
- Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos, so Sam memorized \( C + 6 \) digits.
- Mina memorized six times as many digits of pi as Carlos, so Mina memorized \( 6C \) digits.

Given that Mina memorized 24 digits of pi:

\[
6C = 24
\]

Solving for \( C \):

\[
C = \frac{24}{6} = 4
\]

Now we can find out how many digits Sam memorized:

\[
C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10
\]

Therefore, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.

To determine how many digits Sam memorized, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how many digits Carlos memorized. According to the problem, Mina memorized 6 times as many digits of pi as Carlos. If Mina memorized 24 digits, we can express this relationship as:

   \[
   6 \times \text{Carlos's digits} = 24
   \]

   Solving for Carlos's digits:

   \[
   \text{Carlos's digits} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
   \]

2. Now that we know Carlos memorized 4 digits, we can find out how many digits Sam memorized. The problem states that Sam memorized 6 more digits than Carlos. Therefore:

   \[
   \text{Sam's digits} = \text{Carlos's digits} + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10
   \]

So, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####


system
Let \( c \) represent the number of digits Carlos memorized.

According to the problem:

- Sam memorized six more digits of pi than Carlos: \( s = c + 6 \)
- Mina memorized six times as many digits of pi as Carlos: \( m = 6c \)
  Given that Mina memorized 24 digits of pi: \( m = 24 \)

Let's solve for \( c \) using the equation for Mina:

\[
6c = 24
\]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[
c = \frac{24}{6} = 4
\]

Now that we have \( c \), the number of digits Carlos memorized, we can find Sam's number of digits:

\[
s = c + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10
\]

Therefore, Sam memorized \(\boxed{10}\) digits of pi.

Let's denote the number of digits Carlos memorized as \( C \).

According to the problem, Mina memorized six times as many digits of pi as Carlos. This gives us the equation:

\[ 6C = 24 \]

To find \( C \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ C = 24 / 6 \]
\[ C = 4 \]

Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi.

Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos. So, Sam memorized:

\[ C + 6 \]

Substituting the value we found for \( C \):

\[ Sam = 4 + 6 \]
\[ Sam = 10 \]

Thus, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.

Let's denote the number of digits Carlos memorized as \( C \). According to the problem, Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos, so Sam memorized \( C + 6 \) digits. Mina memorized six times as many digits as Carlos, so Mina memorized \( 6C \) digits.

We are given that Mina memorized 24 digits of pi. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 6C = 24 \]

To find \( C \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ C = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \]

So, Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi. Since Sam memorized 6 more digits than Carlos, we can calculate the number of digits Sam memorized as follows:
\[ C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.

The answer is 10.

To solve this problem, let's define the number of digits Carlos memorized as \(C\).

According to the problem statement, Mina memorized six times as many digits of pi as Carlos. Hence, Mina memorized \(6C\) digits.

The problem also states that Mina memorized 24 digits of pi. Therefore, \(6C = 24\).

From this, we can solve for \(C\):

\[6C = 24\]
\[C = \frac{24}{6}\]
\[C = 4\]

Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi.

Now, let's find out how many digits Sam memorized. The problem states that Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos. Thus, Sam memorized \(C + 6\):

\[C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10\]

Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.

Therefore, the answer is \(10\).

To determine how many digits Sam memorized, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, establish the relationship between the digits of pi memorized by Carlos and Sam.
2. Set up an equation with Mina's memorized digits as the base.
3. Solve for Carlos's memorized digits.
4. Calculate how many digits Sam memorized based on Carlos's digits.

Given:
- Mina memorized 24 digits of $\pi$.
- Mina memorized six times as many digits of $\pi$ as Carlos.
- Sam memorized six more digits of $\pi$ than Carlos.

First, let's find out how many digits Carlos memorized:
\[ 24 \text{ digits of } \pi = 6 \text{ times the digits Carlos memorized} \]

Let \( C \) be the number of digits Carlos memorized. Then:
\[ 24 = 6C \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{24}{6} \]
\[ C = 4 \]

Carlos memorized 4 digits of $\pi$.

Next, determine how many digits Sam memorized by adding six extra digits to what Carlos memorized:
\[ \text{Digits Sam memorized} = C + 6 \]
\[ \text{Digits Sam memorized} = 4 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Digits Sam memorized} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sam memorized 10 digits of $\pi$.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Let's denote the number of digits Carlos memorized as $x$. According to the problem, Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos, so Sam memorized $x + 6$ digits. Mina memorized six times as many digits as Carlos, so Mina memorized $6x$ digits. We know that Mina memorized 24 digits of pi. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[6x = 24\]

Now, let's solve for $x$:

\[x = \frac{24}{6}\]
\[x = 4\]

Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi. Since Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos, we can find out how many Sam memorized by adding 6 to the number of digits Carlos memorized:

\[x + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10\]

Therefore, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.
