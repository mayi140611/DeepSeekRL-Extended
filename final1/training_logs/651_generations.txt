<reasoning>
Hawkeye charged his battery four times at a cost of $3.5 per charge, so the total cost of charging his battery is $3.5 x 4 = $14. His battery charging budget was $20, so the amount of money he was left with when he reached his aunt's place is $20 - $14 = $6.

To determine how much money Hawkeye was left with, we need to calculate the total cost of charging his battery and subtract it from his budget.

1. First, calculate the total cost of charging his battery:
   - Each charge costs $3.5
   - He charged his battery 4 times
   - Total cost = $3.5 × 4

2. Compute the total cost of the charges:
   \[
   3.5 \times 4 = 14
   \]

3. Subtract the total cost of the charges from his budget:
   - His budget was $20
   - He spent $14 on battery charges
   - Remaining budget = $20 - $14

4. Compute the remaining budget:
   \[
   20 - 14 = 6
   \]

Therefore, Hawkeye was left with $6 after reaching his aunt's place.

Reasoning:
1. Hawkeye charged his battery 4 times.
2. Each charge cost him $3.5.
3. Therefore, the total cost of charges = 4 × $3.5 = $14.
4. His total budget was $20.
5. Money left after charges = Total budget - Total cost of charges = $20 - $14 = $6.

First, we calculate the total cost of charging his battery four times. The cost per charge is $3.5, so \(4 \times 3.5 = 14\) dollars.

Hawkeye's total budget was $20. After spending $14 on charging his battery, the remaining amount is \(20 - 14 = 6\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money he was left with is $6.

First, calculate the total cost of charging the battery four times. The cost to charge the battery once is $3.5. Therefore, charging a battery four times would cost \( 4 \times 3.5 = 14 \) dollars. Hawkeye's battery charging budget was $20. Subtract the total cost of charging from his budget to find out how much money he was left with. 
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \] dollars.

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how much Hawkeye spent on charging his battery. Since he charged it four times at a rate of $3.5 per charge, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of charges by the cost per charge:

Total cost = Number of charges × Cost per charge
Total cost = 4 × $3.5

Next, we add the total cost to his initial budget to find out how much he spent in total:

Spent = Total cost + Initial budget
Spent = (4 × $3.5) + $20

Finally, we subtract the total spent from the initial budget to find out how much money he was left with:

Money left = Initial budget - Spent

To determine how much money Hawkeye was left with after charging his battery, we first calculate the total cost of charging the battery.

1. The cost per charge is $3.5.
2. Hawkeye charged his battery four times.

Total cost of charging = Cost per charge × Number of charges
Total cost of charging = $3.5 × 4
Total cost of charging = $14

Next, we subtract the total charging cost from the initial budget to find out how much money Hawkeye was left with.

3. Hawkeye's initial budget is $20.

Money left = Initial budget - Total cost of charging
Money left = $20 - $14
Money left = $6

Therefore, Hawkeye was left with $6 when he reached his aunt's place.

First, let's calculate the total cost of charging the battery. 

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per charge} \times \text{Number of charges}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3.5 \times 4 = 14
\]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the initial budget to find out how much money he has left.

\[
\text{Money left} = \text{Initial budget} - \text{Total cost}
\]

\[
\text{Money left} = 20 - 14 = 6

So, Hawkeye was left with $6 when he reached his aunt's place.

To calculate how much money Hawkeye was left with after charging his battery four times, we first need to find the total cost of charging his battery.

Cost per charge = $3.5
Number of charges = 4

Total cost = Cost per charge × Number of charges
Total cost = $3.5 × 4
Total cost = $14

Hawkeye's battery charging budget was $20. To find out how much money he was left with, we subtract the total cost of the charges from his budget.

Budget = $20
Total cost of charges = $14

Money left = Budget - Total cost of charges
Money left = $20 - $14
Money left = $6

Therefore, Hawkeye was left with $6 when he reached his aunt's place.

Hawkeye charged his battery four times, and each charge costs $3.5. So, the total cost for charging his battery is 4 * $3.5. He also had a $20 budget for charging his battery. To find out how much money he was left with, we subtract the total charging cost from his budget.

The total cost for charging his battery is 4 * $3.5 = $14.
The total money left after charging his battery is $20 - $14 = $6.

To calculate how much money Hawkeye was left with, we first need to find out how much he spent on charging his battery. We can do this by multiplying the cost of one charge ($3.5) by the number of charges (4).

Calculation: $3.5 x 4 = $14

Now that we know Hawkeye spent $14 on charges, we can subtract this amount from his total budget ($20) to find out how much money he had left.

Calculation: $20 - $14 = $6

Therefore, Hawkeye was left with $6 when he reached his aunt's place.
