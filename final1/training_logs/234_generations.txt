system
Mark spends $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25 in total. The cashier has a 1 quarter and a 1 dime which is $0.25 + $0.10. 6.25 - 0.35 = $5.90 change that Mark still needs. Mark gets 5.90 / 0.05 = 118 nickels in his change.

Mark spends $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25 in total.
The cashier gives 7.00 - 6.25 = $0.75 in change.
Since the cashier only has 1 quarter and 1 dime, there is a total of 25 + 10 = 35 cents of change.
Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, Mark gets 35/5 = 7 nickels in his change.

Mark spends $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25.
The total bill is $7.00, so Mark gets $7.00 - $6.25 = $0.75 in change.
He only has 1 quarter = $0.25 and 1 dime = $0.10 in the till.
The total coin value is $0.25 + $0.10 = $0.35.
So Mark gets $0.75 - $0.35 = $0.40.

Since each nickel is worth $0.05, Mark gets $0.40 / $0.05 = 8 nickels.

system
Mark spent $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25 on bread and cheese.

The cashier has 1 quarter ($0.25) and 1 dime ($0.10), which totals $0.35.

Therefore, the change Mark receives is $7.00 - $6.25 = $0.75.

Since the cashier only has nickels, Mark will get $0.75 in nickels.

To find out how many nickels Mark gets, we divide the total change by the value of a nickel, which is $0.05.

Thus, Mark gets $0.75 / $0.05 = 15 nickels.

The total cost of the bread and cheese is $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25. Mark gives the cashier $7.00, so the change is $7.00 - $6.25 = $0.75. The combination of a quarter (worth $0.25) and a dime (worth $0.10) equals $0.35, leaving $0.75 - $0.35 = $0.40 for nickels. Since each nickel is worth $0.05 and the total value is $0.40, Mark gets $0.40 / $0.05 = 8 nickels.

Mark spends $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25.
The cashier has 1 quarter and 1 dime in his till, which is equal to $0.25 + $0.10 = $0.35.
Therefore, Mark's change is $6.25 - $0.35 = $5.90.
Since the cashier has a bunch of nickels, we need to find out how many nickels equal $0.90.
Since 1 nickel is equal to $0.05, we divide $0.90 by $0.05, which gives us 18.
Therefore, Mark gets 18 nickels in his change.

Mark spends $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25 on bread and cheese.

He gives $7.00 to the cashier.

So, Mark is short by $7.00 - $6.25 = $0.75.

The cashier has a quarter and a dime, which make up $0.25 + $0.10 = $0.35.

Therefore, Mark is short by $0.75 - $0.35 = $0.40.

Since the cashier has nickels, which are worth $0.05 each, the number of nickels Mark is short by is $0.40 / $0.05 = 8 nickels.

To determine the number of nickels Mark receives in his change, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought. The cost of the loaf of bread is $4.20 and the cost of the cheese is $2.05. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[4.20 + 2.05 = 6.25\]

Mark paid with $7.00, so the change he should receive is:

\[7.00 - 6.25 = 0.75\]

The cashier has only one quarter and one dime in the till. Since $0.75 is equivalent to 75 cents, the cashier can only make $0.75 with a quarter and a dime. The value of a quarter is 25 cents and the value of a dime is 10 cents, so they cannot make the exact $0.75 with these coins. This means the cashier must have nickels to make the $0.75. Let's determine how many nickels are needed to make $0.75.

Each nickel is worth 5 cents. To get $0.75, we need to find out how many 5-cent nickels make $0.75:

\[0.75 \div 0.05 = 15\]

So, the cashier can make $0.75 with 15 nickels. The total value of the 15 nickels is:

\[15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ cents}\]

Since the cashier only has 1 quarter and 1 dime in the till, he can only use the quarters and dimes to make the $0.75 change, and he must use nickels to make up the remaining 5 cents. Therefore, the number of nickels Mark gets in his change is:

\[15\]

Mark spends $4.20 on bread and $2.05 on cheese, totaling $6.25. He gives the cashier $7.00. The change Mark gets is $7.00 - $6.25 = $0.75. The cashier only has 1 quarter (25 cents) and 1 dime (10 cents) available, so that accounts for $0.35. The remaining change is $0.75 - $0.35 = $0.40. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, Mark gets $0.40 / $0.05 = 8 nickels.
