<reasoning>
To determine how many people the vampire needs to suck each day to survive, we first need to find out how much blood he needs per day. The vampire needs 7 gallons of blood per week, and there are 7 days in a week. So, he needs 7/7 = 1 gallon of blood per day.

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, the vampire needs 1 * 8 = 8 pints of blood per day.

Now, if the vampire sucks 2 pints of blood per person, we can calculate the number of people he needs to suck each day by dividing the total pints he needs by the pints he sucks per person. That is, 8 / 2 = 4 people.

Therefore, the vampire needs to suck 4 people per day to survive.

First, we need to convert the weekly blood requirement into pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 7 gallons is equal to 7 x 8 = 56 pints. 
Next, we need to find out how many pints the vampire needs to feed each day. Since he feeds every day, we can divide the number of pints by 7 (the number of days in a week). So 56 pints / 7 days = 8 pints per day.
Therefore, the vampire needs to feed a total of 8 pints of blood per day.
Now, we know that the vampire sucks 2 pints of blood per person, so we can divide the number of pints by the number of pints per person to find out how many people he needs to feed. 
So, 8 pints / 2 pints per person = 4 people.

To determine how many people the vampire needs to suck each day to survive, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert gallons to pints**: 
   - There are 8 pints in a gallon.
   - Therefore, 7 gallons of blood = \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \) pints of blood.

2. **Calculate the total number of pints the vampire needs per week**:
   - The vampire needs 56 pints of blood in a week.

3. **Calculate the daily blood requirement**:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the vampire needs \( \frac{56}{7} = 8 \) pints of blood per day.

4. **Calculate the number of people the vampire needs to suck each day**:
   - The vampire sucks 2 pints of blood per person.
   - Therefore, the vampire needs \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) people per day.

5. **Account for the remaining person**:
   - We need to ensure that we account for a person who provides the blood required to survive.
   - This last person can contribute to the total consumption but is not strictly necessary from a survival perspective.

So, the vampire needs to suck blood from 4 people each day to survive.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of blood consumed by the vampire in terms of pints, since the vampire's blood consumption rate is given in pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, 7 gallons of blood would be equal to \(7 \times 8 = 56\) pints. 

We also know that the vampire sucks 2 pints of blood per person. Therefore, the number of people the vampire needs to suck each day would be \(56 \div 2 = 28\).

To find out how many people the vampire needs to suck each day, we have already calculated it as 28 people.

To solve this problem, we first need to convert the total weekly blood requirement from gallons to pints, as the blood consumption rate is given in pints.

We know that 1 gallon is equivalent to 8 pints. Therefore:
\[ \text{Total weekly blood requirement in pints} = 7 \text{ gallons/week} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 56 \text{ pints/week} \]

Now, we divide the total weekly blood requirement by the daily consumption to find out how many people he needs to suck each day:
\[ \text{People per day} = \frac{\text{Total weekly blood requirement in pints}}{\text{Pints per person per day}} = \frac{56 \text{ pints/week}}{7 \text{ pints/person/day}} = 8 \text{ people/day} \]

This means the vampire needs to suck the same amount of blood as 8 people over the course of a single day to maintain his survival. Thus, he needs to suck from 8 people each day.

To determine how many people the vampire needs to suck each day, we first need to calculate the total amount of blood he needs to suck in one week, and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

1. Convert gallons to pints: Since 1 gallon equals 8 pints, 7 gallons equals \(7 \times 8 = 56\) pints.
2. Calculate the number of pints per person: If he needs to suck 7 gallons (which is 56 pints) per week and he sucks 2 pints per person, then the number of people he needs to suck is \(56 \div 2 = 28\).
3. Determine the number of people he needs to suck each day: Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of people he needs to suck each day is \(28 \div 7 = 4\).

Therefore, the vampire needs to suck 4 people per day to survive.

To determine how many people the vampire needs to suck each day to survive, we need to first convert gallons to pints and then calculate the number of people based on his daily blood consumption rate.

1 gallon = 8 pints (since 1 gallon = 128 fluid ounces and 1 gallon = 4 quarts and 4 quarts = 8 pints)
Therefore, 7 gallons = 7 * 8 pints = 56 pints

The vampire drinks 2 pints of blood per person, so to find out how many people he needs to suck blood from to get 56 pints, we divide the total amount of blood needed by the amount of blood per person:
$$ \frac{56 \text{ pints}}{2 \text{ pints/person}} = 28 \text{ people} $$

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of people needed by the number of days in a week to find out how many people he needs to suck blood from each day:
$$ \frac{28 \text{ people}}{7 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ people/day} $$

Thus, the vampire needs to suck blood from 4 people each day to survive.

To solve this, first we need to understand the relationship between gallons, pints, and the consumption requirements of a vampire. We can start by converting gallons to pints.
1 gallon is equal to 8 pints.
So, 7 gallons is equal to 7 * 8 = 56 pints.
Next, we need to determine how many pints a vampire consumes per week.
Since the vampire sucks 2 pints of blood per person, the vampire consumes 2 * 7 = 14 pints of blood per week.
Now, to find out how many people the vampire needs to suck per day, we divide the total pints per week by 7.
So, the vampire needs to suck 14 / 7 = 2 people per day.

First, we need to convert gallons to pints since the vampire's blood requirement is given in pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 7 gallons is equal to 7 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 56 pints.

Next, since the vampire needs 2 pints of blood per person, we divide the total amount of blood required by the amount needed per person to find out how many people are needed: 56 pints / 2 pints/person = 28 people.

Finally, since we need to find out how many people the vampire needs to suck blood from each day, we subtract one for the person who was already satisfied (assuming the vampire doesn't need to suck blood from himself) to get 28 people - 1 = 27 people.

To determine how many people the vampire needs to suck each day to survive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pints of blood the vampire needs per week.
2. Convert the total number of pints of blood per week to a weekly pints consumption in gallons.
3. Calculate the number of gallons of blood the vampire needs per day.
4. Determine how many pints of blood the vampire needs to consume each day.
5. Convert the number of pints of blood per day into the number of people needed.

First, we know the vampire needs to suck 7 gallons of blood per week. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, the total number of pints of blood needed per week is:
\[ 7 \, \text{gallons/week} \times 8 \, \text{pints/gallon} = 56 \, \text{pints/week} \]

Next, we convert the total number of pints per week into pints per day by dividing by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{56 \, \text{pints/week}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 8 \, \text{pints/day} \]

Given that the vampire sucks 2 pints of blood per person, the number of people needed per day is:
\[ \frac{8 \, \text{pints/person/day}}{2 \, \text{pints/person}} = 4 \, \text{people/day} \]

So, the vampire needs to suck 4 people each day to survive.
