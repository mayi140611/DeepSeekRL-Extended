###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

At Snowflake Plastics, each employee gets 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year.  If Mark uses half his allotment of both types of days in a year, how many hours' worth of days does he have left if each day covers an 8-hour long workday?

system
Mark gets 10 sick days and 10 vacation days, so he has a total of 10 + 10 = 20 days available per year.
He uses half of each, so he uses 10/2 = 5 sick days and 10/2 = 5 vacation days.
The total number of days he has left is 20 - 5 - 5 = 10 days.
Since each day is 8 hours long, the total hours' worth of days he has left is 10 days * 8 hours/day = 80 hours.

system
To determine how many hours' worth of days Mark has left, we first calculate the total number of sick and vacation days he has initially:

Mark has 10 sick days and 10 vacation days, totaling 20 days per year.

Since Mark uses half of his allotted days, we calculate half of each:

Sick days used: \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) days.
Vacation days used: \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) days.

Now, we subtract the days Mark has used from the total days he receives:

Sick days left: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) days.
Vacation days left: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) days.

Each day covers an 8-hour workday, so for each day left, the hours covered are:

Sick days left in hours: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) hours.
Vacation days left in hours: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) hours.

Adding these together gives the total hours' worth of days left:

Total hours left: \( 40 + 40 = 80 \) hours.

Mark gets a total of 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year. Since Mark uses half of his allotment, he uses 10/2 = 5 sick days and 10/2 = 5 vacation days. In total, he uses 5 + 5 = 10 days. Each day covers 8 hours, so the total number of hours left is 10 * 8 = 80 hours.

Mark uses half his 10 sick days, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) sick days. He also uses half his 10 vacation days, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacation days. In total, he uses \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) days.

Each day covers an 8-hour workday, so 10 days would cover \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) hours.

Mark's total sick days and vacation days per year are 10 each, totaling 20 days per year. He uses half his allotment, so he uses \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) days. Therefore, he has \( 20 - 10 = 10 \) days left.

Each day covers an 8-hour long workday, so his remaining days cover \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) hours.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####


system
Mark has a total of 10 sick days and 10 vacation days, which adds up to 20 days per year. If he uses half of these days, he uses 10 days (half of the sick days) and 10 days (half of the vacation days). So, he uses a total of 20 days. Since each day covers an 8-hour workday, the total number of hours spent for those days is \(20 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 160 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, the hours' worth of days he has left is \(20 \text{ days} - 160 \text{ hours}\). However, we need to convert the days left into hours to answer this question. There are 24 hours in a day, so Mark has \(20 \times 24 = 480\) hours in days left.

Now, let's calculate that.

Mark uses half of his 10 sick days, which is 5 sick days. Mark also uses half of his 10 vacation days, which is 5 vacation days. So in total, Mark uses 5 sick days + 5 vacation days = 10 days.

Since each day is 8 hours long, Mark has 10 days * 8 hours/day = 80 hours' worth of days left.

Mark has a total of 10 sick days + 10 vacation days = 20 days per year.

Since he uses half his allotment, he uses 10 sick days / 2 = 5 sick days, and 10 vacation days / 2 = 5 vacation days.

So, he has 20 total days - 5 sick days - 5 vacation days = 10 remaining days.

If each day covers an 8-hour long workday, then 10 days * 8 hours/day = 80 hours' worth of days he has left.

To determine how many hours' worth of days Mark has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days Mark starts with:**
   - Mark gets 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year.
   - Total days: \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) days.

2. **Determine how many days Mark uses:**
   - Mark uses half of his allotment of both sick and vacation days.
   - Half of 10 sick days used: \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) sick days.
   - Half of 10 vacation days used: \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacation days.
   - Total days used: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) days.

3. **Calculate the number of days Mark has left:**
   - Total days: 20
   - Days used: 10
   - Days left: \( 20 - 10 = 10 \) days.

4. **Convert the remaining days into hours:**
   - Each day is an 8-hour workday.
   - Number of hours left: \( 10 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 80 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, Mark has 80 hours' worth of days left.

Mark has a total of 10 sick days + 10 vacation days = 20 days available for the year.

Since he uses half of his allocation for both types, he uses 10 days for sick days / 2 = 5 sick days and 10 days for vacation days / 2 = 5 vacation days.

If each day is an 8-hour workday, then the 5 sick days left are 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.
Similarly, the 5 vacation days left are 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Together, Mark has 40 hours from sick days + 40 hours from vacation days = 80 hours remaining.

Mark has 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year, which totals to 20 days. If he uses half his allotment, he uses 10 sick days and 10 vacation days, totalling 20 days (as mentioned above).

Thus, Mark's days left are 20 - 20 = 0 days.

Since each day covers an 8-hour long workday, with 0 days left it implies 0 hours.
