First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Joan is going to purchase. She is buying 2 containers of hummus, each costing $5, so the total cost for the hummus is 2 * $5 = $10. She is also buying chicken for $20, bacon for $10, and vegetables for $10. Adding these costs together, the total cost is $10 + $20 + $10 + $10 = $50. Joan also has $60 to spend, so her remaining money after purchasing the hummus, chicken, bacon, and vegetables would be $60 - $50 = $10. Each apple costs $2, so the number of apples she can purchase with her remaining money is $10 / $2 = 5.

Joan starts with $60 to spend. She spends $5 x 2 = $10 on hummus. She then adds the cost of the chicken, bacon, and vegetables, for a total of $20 + $10 + $10 = $40.

So far, she has spent $10 + $40 = $50. This leaves her with $60 - $50 = $10.

Joan is left with $10 to spend on apples, which cost $2 each. The number of apples she can purchase is $10 / $2 = 5 apples.

First, we calculate the total cost of the items Joan is purchasing except for the apples. She will spend $5 on each container of hummus for 2 containers, which totals to $10. The cost of chicken is $20, bacon is $10, and vegetables are $10, which sums up to $40. Adding the hummus, chicken, bacon, and vegetables, we get a total cost of $10 + $40 = $50. Joan started with $60, so with $50 spent, she has $10 left.

Now, Joan wants to purchase apples with the remaining money. Each apple costs $2, so we divide the remaining money by the price of one apple. $10 / $2 = 5 apples. Therefore, Joan can purchase 5 apples with her remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Joan is purchasing. The cost of 2 containers of hummus is 2 * $5 = $10. The cost of chicken is $20, bacon is $10, and vegetables is $10. So, the total cost of these items is $10 + $20 + $10 + $10 = $50.

Joan has $60 in total. The remaining amount after purchasing the items is $60 - $50 = $10.

Now, with the remaining $10, she wants to purchase apples, which are $2 each. To find out how many apples she can buy, we divide the remaining money by the price of one apple: $10 / $2 = 5.

Therefore, Joan can purchase 5 apples with her remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Joan is purchasing:
- 2 containers of hummus: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars
- Chicken: \(20\) dollars
- Bacon: \(10\) dollars
- Vegetables: \(10\) dollars

Total cost of these items: \(10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50\) dollars.

Joan has a total of \(60\) dollars. After purchasing these items, her remaining money will be \(60 - 50 = 10\) dollars.

Now, if apples cost \(2\) dollars each, the number of apples Joan can purchase is \(10 \div 2 = 5\) apples.

Therefore, with her remaining money, Joan can purchase \(5\) apples.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items Joan has already decided to purchase:
- 2 containers of hummus at $5 each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Chicken: $20
- Bacon: $10
- Vegetables: $10

Adding these costs together:
\[
10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50
\]

Joan has $60 to spend, so subtract the cost of these items from her total amount:
\[
60 - 50 = 10
\]

Now, Joan has $10 left to spend on apples. Each apple costs $2, so we can calculate how many apples she can buy with her remaining $10 by dividing $10 by $2:
\[
10 \div 2 = 5
\]

Therefore, Joan can purchase 5 apples with her remaining money.

First, let's calculate how much Joan has spent on the other items she is purchasing. She has purchased 2 containers of hummus for $5 each, which totals to $10. She is also purchasing chicken for $20, bacon for $10, and vegetables for $10, which totals to $40.

Now let's add up all these costs:
- Hummus: $10
- Chicken: $20
- Bacon: $10
- Vegetables: $10

$$10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50$$

Joan has already spent a total of $50 on the other items. She has a total of $60 to spend.

Now let's subtract the amount already spent from the total amount to find out how much money she has remaining:
$$60 - 50 = 10$$

So, Joan has $10 remaining to purchase apples. Each apple costs $2. To find out how many apples she can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one apple:
$$\frac{10}{2} = 5$$

Joan can purchase 5 apples with her remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Joan has already decided to purchase.

The cost of 2 containers of hummus is:
\[2 \text{ containers} \times \$5 \text{ per container} = \$10\]

The combined cost of chicken and bacon is:
\[ \$20 + \$10 = \$30\]

So, the total cost for these three items is:
\[ \$10 + \$30 = \$40\]

Now, Joan has $60 to spend, so we can determine how much is left for apples:
\[ \$60 - \$40 = \$20\]

If each apple costs $2, then the number of apples Joan can purchase is:
\[\frac{\$20}{\$2 \text{ per apple}} = 10 \text{ apples}\]

Therefore, with her remaining money, Joan can purchase 10 apples.

The cost of the bacon is \$10.

Joan has a total of \$60 to spend. After purchasing the listed items, she will have \( \$60 - \$50 = \$10 \) remaining.

Now, we need to determine how many apples she can purchase with this remaining money. Each apple costs \$2, so the number of apples she can purchase is \( \$10 \div \$2 = 5 \).

Joan has $60 in total. She is going to spend on 2 containers of hummus, each costing $5, which totals to $10. She is also going to spend $20 on chicken, $10 on bacon, and $10 on vegetables. Let's calculate the total cost of spices so we know how much is left for apples.

Total cost of hummus = $10
Total cost of chicken = $20
Total cost of bacon = $10
Total cost of vegetables = $10

Total spent so far = $10 + $20 + $10 + $10 = $50

Therefore, the remaining money for apples can be calculated as follows:

Remaining money = Total money - Total spent
                = $60 - $50
                = $10

Each apple costs $2, so the number of apples Joan can purchase can be calculated as follows:

Number of apples = Remaining money / Cost per apple
                = $10 / $2
                = 5

Therefore, Joan can purchase 5 apples with her remaining money.

Joan has a total of $60 to spend. Subtracting the total cost of the items ($45) from her total budget gives her remaining money: $60 - $45 = $15.

Apples cost $2 each. To find out how many apples she can purchase, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one apple: $15 รท $2 = 7.5. Since she cannot purchase half an apple, she would be able to purchase 7 apples.

To determine how many apples Joan can purchase, we first need to calculate her total expenses for the other items and then find out how much money she will have left for apples.

1. Calculating the cost of the hummus: She is buying 2 containers of hummus, priced at $5 each. So the total cost of hummus is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).
2. Adding the cost of chicken: She is buying chicken for $20.
3. Adding the cost of bacon: She is buying bacon for $10.
4. Adding the cost of vegetables: She is buying vegetables for $10.
5. Subtracting these amounts from her total budget: She starts with $60, so after these expenses, she will have \(60 - 10 - 20 - 10 - 10 = \$20\) left for apples.

Now, if apples are $2 each, we can find out how many apples she can purchase by dividing the remaining money by the price of one apple.
