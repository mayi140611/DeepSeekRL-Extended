<reasoning>
Let's denote Angelina's current age as \( A \) and Justin's current age as \( J \).

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. Angelina is 4 years older than Justin: \( A = J + 4 \)
2. In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old: \( A + 5 = 40 \)

In the second equation, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A + 5 = 40 \]
\[ A = 40 - 5 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now we know Angelina's current age is 35. Using the first equation, we can find Justin's age:
\[ 35 = J + 4 \]
\[ J = 35 - 4 \]
\[ J = 31 \]

So, Justin is currently 31 years old.

Let's denote Justin's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem:
1. Angelina is currently 4 years older than Justin, i.e., \( A = J + 4 \).
2. In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old, so her current age is \( A - 5 = 40 \).

Using these two pieces of information, we can set up the following equation:
\[ J + 4 = 40 - 5 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J + 4 = 35 \]
\[ J = 35 - 4 \]
\[ J = 31 \]

So, Justin is currently 31 years old.

Let's denote Justin's current age as \( J \).

According to the information given:
1. Angelina is currently 4 years older than Justin, so her current age is \( J + 4 \).
2. In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old. So, \( (J + 4) + 5 = 40 \).

From the second point, we can set up the following equation:
\[ J + 4 + 5 = 40 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ J + 9 = 40 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 40 - 9 \]
\[ J = 31 \]

So, Justin is currently 31 years old.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
Let's denote Justin's current age by \( J \) and Angelina's current age by \( A \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Angelina is 4 years older than Justin is now. This can be expressed as:
\[ A = J + 4 \]

2. In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old. This can be expressed as:
\[ A + 5 = 40 \]

First, we solve the second equation for \( A \):
\[ A + 5 = 40 \]
\[ A = 40 - 5 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now that we know Angelina's current age is 35, we can use the first equation to find Justin's current age:
\[ A = J + 4 \]
\[ 35 = J + 4 \]
\[ J = 35 - 4 \]
\[ J = 31 \]

So, Justin is currently 31 years old.

Angelina is currently 3 years older than Justin because 40 - 5 = 36 and 40 - 5 = 35 is not a valid age for Angelina. Angelina is currently one year older than Justin because 36 - 4 = 32 and 35 - 4 = 31 is not a valid age for Justin. Therefore, Angelina is currently 41 years old and Justin is 36 years old.

#### GENERATION 9 RESPONSE ####

<reasoning>
Let's denote Justin's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Angelina is currently 4 years older than Justin. So, if we add 4 years to Justin's age, it will be Angelina's current age. This means Angelina's current age is \( J + 4 \).

In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old. Therefore, her current age can also be calculated as \( 40 - 5 \).

Now we can set up an equation to find Justin's current age:

\[ J + 4 = 40 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ J + 4 = 35 \]

To solve for \( J \), we subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ J = 35 - 4 \]
\[ J = 31 \]

So, Justin is currently 31 years old.

Let's denote Justin's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Angelina is 4 years older than Justin is currently, so Angelinaâ€™s current age is \( J + 4 \).

In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old, which means Angelina's age 5 years from now is her current age plus 5 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (J + 4) + 5 = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ J + 9 = 40 \]

To find Justin's current age, we solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 40 - 9 \]

We know that in 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old. Therefore, her current age is \( 40 - 5 = 35 \) years old.

Angelina is 4 years older than Justin is now. If we let \( J \) be Justin's current age, then Angelina's current age can be expressed as \( J + 4 \). Since Angelina is currently 35 years old, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 4 = 35 \]
To find \( J \), we solve the equation by subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[ J = 35 - 4 = 31 \]

We start by establishing the current ages of Angelina and Justin, and then use the information about Angelina's future age to determine the current age of Justin. 

Let's denote Justin's current age as \( J \).
The information states that Angelina is currently 4 years older than Justin. So, if Justin is \( J \) years old, Angelina is \( J + 4 \) years old.

We are also told that in 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent Angelina's age in 5 years:

\[ J + 4 + 5 = 40 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ J + 9 = 40 \]

Now, we can solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 40 - 9 \]
\[ J = 31 \]

Thus, Justin is currently 31 years old.

Let's denote Justin's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Angelina is currently 4 years older than Justin. So, we can express Angelina's current age as \( J + 4 \).

In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old. This gives us the equation:
\[ J + 4 + 5 = 40 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ J + 9 = 40 \]

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ J = 31 \]

Let's denote Justin's current age as \( J \) and Angelina's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, Angelina is 4 years older than Justin is now, so we can write:

\[ A = J + 4 \]

In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ A + 5 = 40 \]

Since we already know that \( A = J + 4 \), we can substitute \( A \) in the equation above:

\[ (J + 4) + 5 = 40 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ J + 9 = 40 \]

To find \( J \), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

\[ J = 40 - 9 \]

\[ J = 31 \]

So, Justin is currently 31 years old.
