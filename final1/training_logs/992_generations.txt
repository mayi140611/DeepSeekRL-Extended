###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?

Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 

1. **Total EYES to be given out:** According to the problem, Oomyapeck eats the remaining eyes after giving two to his dog.
   - He eats 22 eyes.
   - Thus, 22 eyes are given out.

2. **Number of EYES to be given out:** Each eye is worth one unit of eyes.
   - Therefore, the total number of eyes given out is 22.

3. **Number of PEOPLE to eat the eyes:** There are three people: Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck.
   - We want to split these 22 eyes equally among the three.

4. **Eyes per person:** We calculate the number of eyes each person receives by dividing the total eyes by the number of people.
   - Eyes per person = Total Eyestotal number of people = 22 ÷ 3

5. **Result:** 
   - Each person will receive approximately 7. 3333 eyes.
   - But since they need whole fish, and we're told they'll split it equally, it must be 7 or 8, because they can't split an eye into fractions of a fish.

6. **Conclusion:** To have exactly 22 whole eyes distributed equally, one person would receive 7 eyes, another receives 6 eyes, and the third receives 9 to make 22.

Thus, to ensure each person gets an equal share and considering there can't be a fraction of fish, each of them will receive 7 fish from the initial fish count.

To determine how many fish Each of them will be given to eat, we need to find out the total number of fish eaten by the family and then divide that amount by three, since the three of them share the fish.

First, we determine how many eyes are eaten by Oomyapeck. Since he eats 22 eyes himself and gives two eyes to his dog, he eats a total of 22 + 2 = 24 eyes.

Next, we need to find out how many eyes are in each fish. We know that fish eyes are commonly around 10-12 eyes. So, each fish is likely to have around 11 eyes. 

Since they eat 24 eyes from one fish, we can calculate how many fish they eat in total by dividing the number of eyes by the number of eyes per fish:

Total fish eaten = 24 eyes / 11 eyes per fish ≈ 2.18 fish

This means they eat approximately 2 full fish and a little bit of the third one. Since they can't eat a fraction of a fish, we can consider the 2.18 fish to be 2 full fish and a third fish.

To find out how many fish Oomyapeck gets to eat, we need to calculate how many eyes he gets from the fish:

Oomyapeck's fish = 2 full fish * 11 eyes per fish + 1/3rd of the third fish * 11 eyes = 22 + 2 = 24 eyes

Now, we can divide the total number of fish they consume by three to find out how many fish each person gets:

Total fish eaten by family = 2 fish (2 full) + 1/3rd of a third fish (a third of 3 eyes per fish * 11 eyes per fish = 3.67 eyes)
Total fish eaten by family = 2 fish + 1 fish = 3 fish
Each person gets: 3 fish / 3 people = 1 fish per person

Therefore, each person, including Oomyapeck, gets to eat 1 fish.

The answer is that each of them will be given to eat 1 fish.

Let's start by determining how many eyes Oomyapeck eats. According to the problem, Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes. Since he gives two eyes to his dog, he must have eaten \(22 - 2 = 20\) eyes.

Since each eye represents a portion of the fish that Oomyapeck eats, it means that 20 portions of the fish were eaten. Because the fish was split equally between the three of them, each person received \( \frac{20}{3} \) portions of the fish.

However, since the problem doesn't indicate any other fishing effort or additional eyes being eaten, we can assume that the portions are divided purely based on the fish that were caught that day. Given that they split the fish equally and Oomyapeck ate 20 eyes, this calculation doesn't need adjustments based on additional eating.

Now, if each person gets the same proportions of the fish, and they split the fish equally among all three of them, each person would end up with approximately \(\frac{20}{3}\) portions. So, to find the exact number of fish they get, we need to consider the total amount of fish that actually exists.

Assuming each portion of fish eaten is a whole fish (as no fractional fish is mentioned), the total amount of fish is 20 fish. Since they split the fish equally, each person receives \( \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) fish.

Therefore, each person will be given 6.67 fish to eat.

1. Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day.
2. Oomyapeck gives two eyes to his dog, so he eats 22 - 2 = 20 eyes.
3. Oomyapeck eats the rest, which is 22 - 20 = 2 eyes.
4. Oomyapeck is given 2 eyes to eat. As his share is split equally between his parents, each child gets 1/3 of the 2 eyes. This means each parent receives a total of 2 / 3 eye.
5. The total number of fish caught by Ittymangnark each day is equal to the number of eyes his children and himself will eat. So, Ittymangnark got 1/3 fish, Kingnook got 1/3 fish, and Oomyapeck got 2/3 fish.
6. The fish caught by Ittymangnark, Kingnook and Oomyapeck add up to the sum of 1/3 + 1/3 + 2/3 = 4/3 fish which is equal to the total number of eyes caught by Ittymangnark each day.
7. So, the number of fish caught by Ittymangnark each day is equal to the number of eyes caught by Ittymangnark.
8. Since Oomyapeck eats 2 eyes and it's equal to 1 fish, he will have 2 fish to eat.
9. Each of Ittymangnark and Kingnook will have 2 fish to eat a day. Ittymangnark ate 22 fish in a day, so he was given 22 / 2 = 11 fish for each of his three days.

The total number of eyes Oomyapeck eats represents the total number of fish because each eye corresponds to a fish. Since Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, this means he eats 22 fish.

Each fish is split equally between Ittymangnark and Kingnook. Therefore, the total number of fish is:
\[ \text{Total fish} = \text{Number of eyes Oomyapeck eats} \times \text{Number of people} \]
\[ \text{Total fish} = 22 \text{ fish} \times 3 \text{ people} \]
\[ \text{Total fish} = 66 \text{ fish} \]

Since the 66 fish are split equally among the three, each person gets:
\[ \text{Fish per person} = \frac{\text{Total fish}}{\text{Number of people}} \]
\[ \text{Fish per person} = \frac{66}{3} \]
\[ \text{Fish per person} = 22 \text{ fish} \]

So, each of them will be given 22 fish to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day.

Let's denote the total number of fish as \( T \).

Since Ittymangnark catches enough fish for three of them (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck) to eat for the day, he splits the fish evenly between the three of them. So each person gets \( \frac{T}{3} \) fish.

After they split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes. Since each fish has 2 eyes, Oomyapeck gets \( 2 \times \frac{T}{3} \) eyes.

Oomyapeck gives two eyes to his dog, so he eats \( 22 \) eyes himself.

This means the total number of eyes eaten by Oomyapeck is:
\[ 2 \text{ (given to dog)} + 22 \text{ (eaten by Oomyapeck)} = 24 \text{ eyes} \]

Since each fish has 2 eyes, the total number of fish caught is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ eyes}}{2 \text{ eyes per fish}} = 12 \text{ fish} \]

Since the total number of fish caught is 12, and they split them evenly between the three of them, each person gets \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) fish.

So each person will be given 4 fish to eat in a day.

To determine how many fish each person will eat, we need to break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total number of eyes eaten by Oomyapeck:** 
   Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes.

2. **Eyes given to his dog:**
   Oomyapeck gives 2 eyes to his dog. 

3. **Eyes eaten by Oomyapeck:**
   Oomyapeck eats the remaining eyes. Therefore, the number of eyes Oomyapeck eats is:
   \[
   \text{Total eyes eaten minus eyes given to dog} = 22 - 2 = 20 \text{ eyes}
   \]

4. **Eyes received by Oomyapeck:**
   Each fish has 2 eyes. Therefore, the number of fish Oomyapeck received is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ eyes}}{2 \text{ eyes per fish}} = 10 \text{ fish}
   \]

5. **Total number of fish:**
   Ittymangnark and Kingnook together catch enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day. Let this total number of fish be \( F \). Since they split the fish equally, each of them would receive:
   \[
   \frac{F}{3} \text{ fish}
   \]

6. **Fish given to Oomyapeck:**
   Since Oomyapeck eats the fish he received, the number of fish given to Oomyapeck is the same as the number of fish he received.

Thus, each of them is given to eat:
\[
\frac{F}{3} \text{ fish}
\]

Given that the total number of fish \( F \) is \( 10 \):
\[
\frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ fish per person}
\]

However, it seems the question implies whole numbers of fish, so it may be misinterpreted or there might be another factor not considered. Assuming whole fish, the calculation should be with exact whole fish.

Hence, the exact number of fish each is given to eat can be checked with the given information:
- Ittymangnark ends with \(\frac{F}{3}\) fish.
- Kingnook ends with \(\frac{F}{3}\) fish.
- Oomyapeck has \( \frac{F}{3} \) fish.

Each of them would have:
\[ \frac{F}{3} \]

So, dividing the fish into equal parts.

Therefore, each of them receives \(\frac{F}{3}\).

Finally, since we assumed total fish \( F = 10 \), each one receives:
\[
\frac{10}{3} = 3 \frac{1}{3} \text{ fish}
\]

However, given whole fish, it should be rechecked or potentially reinterpreted. We consider \( \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33\).

Let's denote the number of fish each person eats as $F$.
Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes from the fish, and since he gives two eyes to his dog, he eats $22 - 2 = 20$ eyes.
Thus, the total number of eyes in each fish is 20, or $20 = \frac{2F}{3}$ because Ittymangnark and Kingnook take their share first, which is $\frac{2F}{3}$.
Therefore, $F = \frac{2 \times 3 \times 20}{2} = 60$.

Let's denote the total number of fish caught by Ittymangnark as a whole. Since they share the fish equally between the three of them, each person gets an equal share of the fish.

After sharing the fish, Oomyapeck keeps some eyes for himself and gives the rest to his dog. Since Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day, the remaining number of eyes given to the dog is:

22 (Eyes eaten by Oomyapeck) - 2 (Eyes given to the dog) = 20 eyes

Since each fish has 2 eyes, the total number of fish caught would be:

20 eyes (given to the dog) * 2 eyes per fish = 40 fish

Since the fish are shared equally, each person would get:

40 fish / 3 people = 13. 33 fish

Therefore, each person gets 13 fish if we consider the whole number part.

However, if we want to be more accurate, Let's assume that the additional "fish" that each person gets comes from the eyes eaten by the dog. In that case, the eye allocation would be like a percentage rather than an exact share, like:

13 fish + (22 eyes / 40) * 13 fish
= 13 fish + 0. 55 * 13 fish
= 13 fish + 7. 15 fish
= 20. 15 fish

Thus, Oomyapeck, given that he will likely eat more than the average consumption of the dog, will end up eating approximately 13 fish.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step. 

1. **Understanding Fish Distribution:**
   - Each day, Ittymangnark catches enough fish to provide for the three of them (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck).
   - This means they split the fish equally between the three of them, implying the total number of fish caught is divisible by 3.

2. **Eyes Given to Oomyapeck:**
   - After dividing the fish, Oomyapeck is given all of the eyes. 
   - Then Oomyapeck himself eats 22 eyes.
   - The remaining eyes must be given to his dog, which eats 0 eyes because there are no eyes left after Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes.

3. **Total Eyes:**
   - Since Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes and we know that the remaining eyes are given to the dog which eats 0 eyes, the entire number of eyes is exactly 22.
   
4. **Fish and Eyes Relationship:**
   - Since it's stated that eyes are equivalent to fish, we know that the number of eyes is equal to the number of fish.

5. **Equating Fish and Eyes:**
   - If Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes and the dog eats 0 eyes, then he must have received 22 fish.

6. **Cotribution of Fish and Eyes to Total:**
   - Since fish and eyes are interchangeable, the total number of fish caught is equal to the total number of fish eaten by the trio which is 22.

Given that They split the fish equally, we can divide the total fish from Oomyapeck's eyes into the three of them:

7. **Fish per Person:**
   - Since they split the fish, Oomyapeck receives:
   \[
   \frac{22}{3} = 7 \text{ fish per person for Oomyapeck}
   \]

As a result of this reasoning, the fish each person receives are:
- Oomyapeck: 7 fish

After this calculation and reasoning, we have:

Let's denote the total number of fish caught by Ittymangnark and Kingnook as \( F \). Since they split the fish equally, each person gets \( \frac{F}{3} \) fish initially.

After splitting, Oomyapeck receives \( \frac{F}{3} \) fish. According to the problem, Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes. Since he gives two eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself, the number of eyes he eats himself is:
\[ 22 - 2 = 20 \]

Since each eye corresponds to half a fish (assuming each eye is equally large), the total number of fish that Oomyapeck eats is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ fish} \]

This means that \( \frac{F}{3} = 40 \), so:
\[ F = 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ fish} \]

Since they split the fish equally, each person gets:

2. Since We call 22 eyes and each fish gives 2 eyes, the number of fish \( F \) can be calculated as:

However, the number of fish must be a whole number, and it's not logical to split a fish in half. Let's reevaluate: if we have 11 eyes per fish, then each person (including Kingnook) should receive 5 fish because they split the 11 eyes equally into two for the entire family. Therefore, we get:
\[ 5\text{ fish} / 3 \approx 1.67 \]

Similarly, Inittymangnark and Kingnook split the fish equally between the three of them. Since Oomyapeck eats half the eyes, he would be eating half the fish. Therefore, the total fish caught every day is equal to the number of eyes divided by 2, which is 40 fish.

Since this fish is caught by all three of them every day, they split it equally. So, each of them will get \(40 / 3 = 13\) fish (remainder 1).

Let's denote the number of fish each of them eats as \( x \).

Each fish Oomyapeck receives gives 2 eyes, and he gives 2 eyes to his dog. Therefore, Oomyapeck eats the remaining \( 2 - 2 = 0 \) eyes per fish.

Since Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day, the total number of fish given to them is \( 22 \).

Now, let's see how many fish each of them get:
- Since each fish gives 2 eyes, and Oomyapeck gets 2 eyes from each fish, the fish give each person \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) fish per person.
- Therefore, they will be given \( 22 \) fish in total, so each person will be given \( \frac{22}{3} = 7.33 \) fish. 

Since the number of fish they are given cannot be fractional in this situation, we can round this to the nearest whole number. However, since we are discussing fish and the context implies they might be whole fish, it would be more appropriate to say that each person gets exactly 7 fish, and there is an odd amount of eyes that needs to be accounted for.
