Half the people at the dinner party is 16 / 2 = 8 people.

8 people eat 1.5 rolls each, so they eat a total of 8 * 1.5 = 12 rolls.

The other 8 people eat 0.5 rolls each, so they eat a total of 8 * 0.5 = 4 rolls.

So in total, the people eat 12 + 4 = 16 rolls.

There are 40 available rolls, so 40 - 16 = 24 rolls are leftover.

Half the 16 people eat 1 1/2 rolls each, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times \frac{3}{2} = 12 \) rolls. The other half eat \( \frac{1}{2} \) each, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4 \) rolls. In total, they consume \( 12 + 4 = 16 \) rolls. So, the leftover rolls are \( 40 - 16 = 24 \).

Half the people at the dinner party is 16 / 2 = 8 people.
8 people eat 1 1/2 rolls each, which is 1.5 * 8 = 12 rolls.
1/2 a roll is eaten by the other half of the people, which is 8 / 2 * 0.5 = 2 rolls.
8 people eat 1.5 rolls and the other 8 people eats 0.5 rolls, 8 * 1.5 + 8 * 0.5 = 12 + 4 = 16 rolls are eaten.
There were 40 eaten rolls and 16 rolls that were eaten leaving 40 - 16 = 24 dinner rolls leftover.

To find out how many dinner rolls are leftover, let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by each group of people.
2. Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by all people.
3. Subtract the total number of rolls consumed from the number of rolls available.

Step 1: Half the people eat 1 1/2 rolls each, which is equivalent to 1.5 rolls. There are 16 people, so half of them is 8 people. Each of these 8 people eats 1.5 rolls, so the total number of rolls consumed by this group is:
8 * 1.5 = 12 rolls

The other half of the people eat 1/2 a roll each, which is equivalent to 0.5 rolls. Also, there are 16 people, so half of them is 8 people. Each of these 8 people eats 0.5 rolls, so the total number of rolls consumed by this group is:
8 * 0.5 = 4 rolls

Step 2: Add the rolls consumed by both groups to find the total number of rolls consumed:
12 + 4 = 16 rolls

Step 3: Subtract the total number of rolls consumed from the number of rolls available:
40 - 16 = 24 rolls

Therefore, there are 24 dinner rolls leftover.

Half of the 16 people is 8 people, so 8 people eat 1.5 rolls each. That would be 8 * 1.5 = 12 rolls.

The other half is 8 people as well, and each eats 0.5 rolls. That's 8 * 0.5 = 4 rolls.

Combined, that's 12 + 4 = 16 rolls eaten.

To determine the leftover dinner rolls, we first need to calculate how many people eat 1.5 rolls and how many eat 0.5 rolls. There are 16 people and they are divided into two equal groups of 8 people each.

1. Calculate the number of people who eat 1.5 rolls:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ people}
   \]
   Each of these 4 people eats \(1.5\) rolls:
   \[
   4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ rolls}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of people who eat 0.5 rolls:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ people}
   \]
   Each of these 4 people eats \(0.5\) rolls:
   \[
   4 \times 0.5 = 2 \text{ rolls}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of rolls consumed:
   \[
   6 \text{ rolls (from the first group)} + 2 \text{ rolls (from the second group)} = 8 \text{ rolls}
   \]

4. Determine the number of leftover rolls:
   \[
   40 \text{ total rolls} - 8 \text{ rolls consumed} = 32 \text{ rolls leftover}
   \]

Half the people at the dinner party is 16/2 = 8 people.
The first half of 8 people eats 1 1/2 dinner rolls each, which is 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 dinner rolls.
So, these people eat a total of 8 * 3 = 24 dinner rolls.
The other half of the 16 people eats 1/2 a roll each, which totals 8 * 0.5 = 4 dinner rolls.
To find out how many dinner rolls are leftover, subtract the total number consumed by the first half and the second half of the people from the total number of dinner rolls available. There are 24 + 4 = 28 dinner rolls.
There are 40 - 28 = 12 dinner rolls leftover.

To find out how many dinner rolls are leftover, we can follow these steps:

1. Half of the 16 people eat 1 and 1/2 rolls each:
   16 / 2 = 8 people
   8 * 1.5 = 12 dinner rolls

2. The other half eat 1/2 roll each:
   8 people
   8 * 0.5 = 4 dinner rolls

3. Total dinner rolls eaten:
   12 + 4 = 16 dinner rolls

4. Subtract the total eaten from the initial roll amount:
   40 rolls - 16 rolls = 24 dinner rolls leftover
