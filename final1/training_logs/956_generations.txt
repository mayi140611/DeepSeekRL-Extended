<reasoning>
Johnny TV makes 25 percent more movies than L&J Productions each year, so Johnny TV produces an additional 0.25 * 220 = 55 movies per year.
L&J Productions produces 220 movies in a year, and Johnny TV produces 55 more, so together they produce 220 + 55 = 275 movies per year.
In five years, the two production companies together produce 275 * 5 = 1375 movies.

Johnny TV produces 1.25 times as many movies as L&J Productions. So, Johnny TV produces \( 1.25 \times 220 = 275 \) movies in a year.

To find the total number of movies produced by both companies in five years, we calculate the total for one year and then multiply by 5.

Let's perform the calculations:
\( \text{Johnny TV annual movies} = 275 \times 5 = 1375 \)
\( \text{Total movies in one year} = 275 + 220 = 495 \)
\( \text{Total movies in five years} = 495 \times 5 = 2475 \)

Thus, the two production companies produce 2475 movies in five years combined.

To find out how many movies Johnny TV produces in a year, we calculate 25% of L&J Productions' movies and add it to their total. Then we multiply the total annual output by 5 to find the combined output over five years. 

First, Johnny TV makes 25% more movies than L&J Productions each year. To find this amount:
\[ \text{Johnny TV's extra movies} = 220 \times 0.25 \]

\[ \text{Johnny TV's extra movies} = 55 \]

So, Johnny TV produces:
\[ \text{Johnny TV total} = 220 + 55 = 275 \text{ movies per year} \]

Now, to find the combined output over 5 years:
\[ \text{Johnny TV total} = 5 \times 275 \]

\[ \text{Johnny TV total} = 1375 \text{ movies in 5 years} \]

\[ \text{L&J Productions total} = 5 \times 220 \]

\[ \text{L&J Productions total} = 1100 \text{ movies in 5 years} \]

Combined, the two production companies produce:
\[ \text{Total} = 1375 + 1100 \]

\[ \text{Total} = 2475 \text{ movies in 5 years} \]

Therefore, the final answer is 2475 movies.

To find out how many movies each company produces, we start by calculating the number of movies Johnny TV produces in a year. Johnny TV produces 25% more movies than L&J Productions, which means Johnny TV produces 125% of the movies L&J Productions makes. Since L&J Productions makes 220 movies per year, Johnny TV makes \( 125 \times 220 = 2750 \) movies per year. 

Next, to find the combined yearly production, we add the number of movies made by both companies: \( 2750 + 220 = 2970 \) movies per year.

Finally, to find the combined production over five years, we multiply the yearly production by 5: \( 2970 \times 5 = 14850 \).

So, the two production companies produce 14,850 movies combined in five years.

To determine the total number of movies produced by Johnny TV and L&J Productions in five years, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of movies Johnny TV makes in one year:
   Johnny TV makes 25% more movies than L&J Productions. Therefore, the number of movies Johnny TV makes in one year is \(25\% \times 220 + 220 = 0.25 \times 220 + 220 = 55 + 220 = 275\).

2. Calculate the number of movies each production company makes in five years:
   - L&J Productions makes 220 movies per year, so in five years, they make \(220 \times 5 = 1100\) movies.
   - Johnny TV makes 275 movies per year, so in five years, they make \(275 \times 5 = 1375\) movies.

3. Calculate the combined total number of movies produced by both companies in five years:

Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to calculate Johnny TV's annual production. Since Johnny TV makes 25 percent more movies than L&J Productions each year, we can calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Johnny TV's production per year} = \text{LJ Productions' production per year} + (0.25 \times \text{LJ Productions' production per year}) \]
\[ = 220 + (0.25 \times 220) \]
\[ = 220 + 55 \]
\[ = 275 \text{ movies} \]

Next, we calculate the total production of both companies over a 5-year period:
\[ \text{Johnny TV's total production in 5 years} = 5 \times 275 \]
\[ = 1375 \text{ movies} \]

\[ \text{LJ Productions' total production in 5 years} = 5 \times 220 \]
\[ = 1100 \text{ movies} \]

Finally, we add the totals to find the combined production:
\[ \text{Combined total production in 5 years} = 1375 + 1100 \]
\[ = 2475 \text{ movies} \]

So, the combined production of both companies over 5 years is 2475 movies.

To find out how many movies Johnny TV produces in a year, we need to calculate 25% more than L&J Productions' 220 movies.
25% of 220 movies is calculated as follows:
\( 25% = 0.25 \)
\( 25\% \times 220 = 0.25 \times 220 = 55 \)

Now add this to the original amount to get Johnny TV's production:
\( 220 + 55 = 275 \) movies per year.

Next, to find out how many movies the two companies produce in five years combined, we need to multiply their annual production numbers by 5.
L&J Productions produces 220 movies/year, so in 5 years:
\( 220 \times 5 = 1100 \)
Johnny TV produces 275 movies/year, so in 5 years:
\( 275 \times 5 = 1375 \)

To find the total number of movies produced in 5 years by both companies combined, we add their 5-year production numbers:
\( 1100 + 1375 = 2475 \)

So, the two production companies produce 2475 movies in total in five years combined.

1. Johnny TV makes 25 percent more movies than L&J Productions each year.
2. L&J Productions produces 220 movies in a year.
3. We need to calculate how many movies Johnny TV produces in a year and then combine the totals.

Let's determine the number of movies Johnny TV produces each year. Johnny TV makes 25 percent more movies than L&J Productions each year. 

1. First, calculate 25% of 220 movies:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 220 = \frac{25}{100} \times 220 = 0.25 \times 220 = 55

So Johnny TV produces 275 movies in a year.

Now we calculate the total number of movies both companies produce in five years:
1. L&J Productions produces 220 movies per year:
   \[
   220 \times 5 = 1100 \text{ movies}

To determine how many movies Johnny TV and L&J Productions produce in five years combined, we first need to calculate the number of movies Johnny TV produces in one year and then extend that to five years.

1. Johnny TV produces 25 percent more movies than L&J Productions each year. This means if L&J Productions produces \( L \) movies, Johnny TV produces \( L + 0.25L = 1.25L \) movies.
2. Given that L&J Productions produces 220 movies in a year, Johnny TV produces \( 1.25 \times 220 = 275 \) movies in a year.
3. To find out how many movies they produce in five years combined, we multiply the yearly totals by 5. So, \( 275 \times 5 = 1375 \) movies for Johnny TV and \( 220 \times 5 = 1100 \) movies for L&J Productions.
