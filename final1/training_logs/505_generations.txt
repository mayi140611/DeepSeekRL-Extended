###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Terese thinks that running various distances throughout the week can make one healthy.  On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles;  Tuesday, 3.8 miles; Wednesday, 3.6 miles; and on Thursday, 4.4 miles.  Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.

system
To find the average distance Terese runs on each day, we first need to calculate the total distance she runs over the four days. We do this by adding up the distances:

\[
4.2 \text{ miles} + 3.8 \text{ miles} + 3.6 \text{ miles} + 4.4 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
4.2 + 3.8 = 8.0
\]
\[
8.0 + 3.6 = 11.6
\]
\[
11.6 + 4.4 = 16.0
\]

So, Terese runs a total of 16.0 miles in the four days.

Next, we find the average by dividing the total distance by the number of days:

\[
\text{Average distance} = \frac{16.0 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ days}} = 4.0 \text{ miles per day}
\]

Therefore, the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs is 4.0 miles.

To find the average distance Terese runs, we need to add up the distances she ran each day and then divide by the number of days.

Let's add the distances:
4.2 miles (Monday) + 3.8 miles (Tuesday) + 3.6 miles (Wednesday) + 4.4 miles (Thursday) = 16 miles

Now, we divide the total distance by the number of days (4):
16 miles รท 4 days = 4 miles/day

The average distance Terese runs on each day she runs is 4 miles.

To find the average distance Terese runs on each day, we need to add up the distances from all the days and then divide by the number of days.

The distances run on each day are:
- Monday: 4.2 miles
- Tuesday: 3.8 miles
- Wednesday: 3.6 miles
- Thursday: 4.4 miles

First, we add up these distances:
4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles

Next, we divide the total distance by the number of days (which is 4 in this case):

16 miles รท 4 days = 4 miles/day

Therefore, the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs is 4 miles.

Monday: 4.2 miles
Tuesday: 3.8 miles

Total distance = 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles

Now, we divide this total by the number of days to find the average:

Average distance = Total distance / Number of days
Average distance = 16 miles / 4 days = 4 miles per day

So, Terese runs an average of 4 miles per day.

To determine the average distance Terese runs on each day, we first need to find the total distance she runs throughout the week and then divide that by the number of days she runs.

Total distance run = Monday's distance + Tuesday's distance + Wednesday's distance + Thursday's distance
Total distance run = 4.2 miles + 3.8 miles + 3.6 miles + 4.4 miles
Total distance run = 16 miles

Now, to find the average distance, we divide the total distance by the number of days (which is 4 in this case).

Average distance = Total distance run / Number of days
Average distance = 16 miles / 4
Average distance = 4 miles

So, the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs is 4 miles.

To find the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs, we first need to calculate the total distance she runs over the four days and then divide that by the number of days.

The total distance is the sum of the distances run on each day:
Total distance = 4.2 miles (Monday) + 3.8 miles (Tuesday) + 3.6 miles (Wednesday) + 4.4 miles (Thursday)

Total distance = 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4
Total distance = 16.2 miles

Now, we divide the total distance by the number of days (which is 4) to find the average distance per day:
Average distance = Total distance / Number of days
Average distance = 16.2 miles / 4
Average distance = 4.05 miles

The answer is 4.05 miles.

1. Calculate the total distance run over the four days.
2. Divide the total distance by the number of days (which is 4) to find the average.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance.
\[ 
\text{Total distance} = 4.2 \text{ miles} + 3.8 \text{ miles} + 3.6 \text{ miles} + 4.4 \text{ miles}

\[ 
11.6 + 4.4 = 16.0 \, \text{miles} 
\]

So, the total distance run over the four days is 16.0 miles.

Step 2: Divide the total distance by the number of days.
\[
\text{Average distance} = \frac{16.0 \, \text{miles}}{4 \, \text{days}}
