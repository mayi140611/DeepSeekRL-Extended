###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A trader made a profit of $960 after a week of sales. To raise $610 to pay for her next shipment of wares, she splits the profit in half and solicits donations from her family and friends. If she received a total donation of $310 and adds it to one-half of her profit, how much money did she make above her goal?

To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:

1. The trader makes a profit of $960.
2. She splits this profit in half, so half of the profit is $960 / 2 = $480.
3. She also received a total donation of $310 from her family and friends.
4. To raise $610, she adds one-half of her profit ($480) and the donations ($310).
   Therefore, the total amount raised is $480 + $310 = $790.
5. To find out how much money she made above her goal, we subtract her goal ($610) from the total amount raised ($790):
   $790 - $610 = $180.

To find how much profit the trader made above her goal, let's follow these steps:

1. First, we need to add the donations she received to one-half of her profit. She received a total donation of $310, which is half of $620, thus $310 / $620 = $0.50 per dollar. This means that she added $310 to her half of the profit.

2. Therefore, the total profit in dollars is $310 + $0.50 * $960 = $310 + $480 = $790

3. Next, we find how much above the goal of $610 she raised by subtracting the goal from the total profit: $790 - $610 = $180

4. So, the trader made $180 more than her goal of $610.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The trader starts with $960.
2. She splits the profit in half: $$960 / 2 = $480$.
3. She receives a total donation of $310.
4. Adding the donation to half of her profit gives: $480 + $310 = $790$.
5. Her goal is to raise $610, so the amount she made above her goal is: $790 - $610 = $180$.

First, we need to find out how much money the trader made above her goal by adding the donations she received to one-half of her profit. The trader made a profit of $960 and she received a total donation of $310. After splitting the profit in half, she has $480. Adding the donations to this half-profit, she has $480 + $310 = $790. Her goal was to raise $610, so she made $790 - $610 = $180 above her goal.

The trader initially made a profit of $960. She splits this profit in half, which results in $960 / 2 = $480. She also received a total donation of $310 from her family and friends. Adding this amount to half of her profit, we get $480 + $310 = $790.

To find out how much money she made above her goal, we subtract her goal ($610) from the total amount ($790). This gives us $790 - $610 = $180.

Therefore, she made $180 above her goal.

The trader makes a profit of $960. She splits this in half to get $480. She then receives an additional $310 in donations. The total amount of money she has is $480 (half of the profit) + $310 (donations) = $790. Her goal is to raise $610. The amount of money she has above her goal is $790 - $610 = $180.

The trader made a profit of $960. She splits this profit in half, which means she has $960 / 2 = $480. She also received a total donation of $310 from her family and friends. To raise $610, she needs to add her half of the profit and the donation to her goal. So, she needs $610 + $480 + $310 = $1400 in total. She has already reached her goal by making $1400 - $610 = $790.

To find out how much money she made above her goal, we subtract her goal from the total amount she has managed to raise. So, she made $790 - $610 = $180 above her goal.

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate one-half of the trader's profit.
2. Add the total donation received to this half.
3. Subtract the total goal from this sum to find out how much money she made above her goal.

Step 1: One-half of the trader's profit is $960 / 2 = $480.

Step 2: Adding the total donation received to this half gives $480 + $310 = $790.

Step 3: Subtracting the total goal from this sum gives $790 - $610 = $180.

Therefore, the trader made $180 above her goal.

The trader initially made a profit of $960. To raise $610, she splits the profit in half, which means she would need two-thirds of $960. This amount is calculated as:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 960 = 640
\]

However, it is given that she needs exactly $610, which means she needs less than two-thirds of $960. 

She then receives a total donation of $310. Adding this to the half of her profit, the total amount of money she ends up with is:

\[
640 + 310 = 950
\]

Now, to find out how much money she made above her goal of $610, we subtract the goal from the total amount:

\[
950 - 610 = 340
\]

Therefore, the trader made $340 above her goal.

To raise $610 to pay for her next shipment of wares, she needs to have at least $610 + $480 (half of her profit) + $310 (donation) = $1400.

The trader initially made a profit of $960. She splits this profit in half, so the half profit is $960 / 2 = $480. She also received a donation of $310. To find out how much money she made above her goal, we add the half profit and the donation to her profit and then subtract her goal. 

Half profit: $480
Donation: $310
Profit: $960
Goal: $610
Amount made: ($480 + $310 + $960) - $610 = $1750 - $610 = $1140

Therefore, the trader made $1140 above her goal.

The trader initially makes a profit of $960, but she needs to raise $610. So, she needs to make an additional $610 - $960 / 2 = $310 to reach her goal.

She receives a donation of $310 from her family and friends. Adding this to one-half of her profit, we get:

1/2 * $960 + $310 = $480 + $310 = $790.

First, we need to determine how much half of the trader's profit is. Since her total profit was $960, half of that would be $960 / 2 = $480. Next, we add the donated amount of $310 to this half of the profit, giving us $480 + $310 = $790.

Her goal was to raise $610, so to find out how much money she made above her goal, we subtract her goal from the total amount she collected: $790 - $610 = $180.
