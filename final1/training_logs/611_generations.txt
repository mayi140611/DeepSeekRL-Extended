system
To find the percentage of green bottle caps, we first need to determine how many green caps Ali has. Since he has a total of 125 bottle caps and 50 of them are red, we subtract the number of red caps from the total to find the number of green caps:

\[
\text{Number of green caps} = 125 - 50 = 75
\]

Next, to find the percentage of green caps, we divide the number of green caps by the total number of caps and then multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage of green caps} = \left(\frac{75}{125}\right) \times 100
\]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[
\frac{75}{125} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Now, multiplying by 100 to convert to percentage:

\[
\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \times 100 = 60\%
\]

So, 60% of the bottle caps are green.

To find the percentage of green caps, we first need to determine how many green caps Ali has. We know that Ali has a total of 125 bottle caps and 50 of them are red. Therefore, the number of green caps is:

\[ \text{Green caps} = 125 - 50 = 75 \]

Next, to find the percentage of green caps, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of green caps}}{\text{Total number of caps}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the known values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{75}{125} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( 0.6 \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of caps that are green is 60%.

To find the percentage of green caps, we first need to determine how many green caps Ali has. We know the total number of caps and the number of red caps.

The total number of caps = 125
Number of red caps = 50

So, the number of green caps = Total caps - Red caps
Number of green caps = 125 - 50 = 75

Now, to find the percentage of green caps, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of green caps}}{\text{Total number of caps}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{75}{125} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{3}{5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = 0.6 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of green caps is 60%.

To find the percentage of green bottle caps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of green bottle caps by subtracting the number of red bottle caps from the total number of bottle caps.
2. Use the formula to calculate the percentage of green caps: 
   \[
   \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of green caps}}{\text{Total number of caps}} \right) \times 100
   \]

Let's do the calculation:

1. Number of green caps = Total caps - Red caps
   Number of green caps = 125 - 50 = 75

2. Percentage of green caps = \(\left( \frac{75}{125} \right) \times 100\)

Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{75}{125} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]

So:
   \[
   \left( \frac{3}{5} \right) \times 100 = 60\%
   \]

Therefore, 60% of the bottle caps are green.

We know that Ali has a total of 125 bottle caps. Out of these, 50 are red caps. Therefore, the remaining caps must be green. To find the number of green caps, we subtract the number of red caps from the total number of caps:
\[ \text{Green caps} = \text{Total caps} - \text{Red caps} = 125 - 50 \]

Once we have the number of green caps, we can calculate the percentage of caps that are green using the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of green caps}}{\text{Total caps}} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's start by determining the total number of green bottle caps that Ali has. We know that the total number of bottle caps is 125, and out of these, 50 are red. Therefore, the number of green bottle caps is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of green bottle caps} = \text{Total number of bottle caps} - \text{Number of red bottle caps} = 125 - 50 = 75
\]

Next, we calculate the percentage of caps that are green. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[
\text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of green bottle caps}}{\text{Total number of bottle caps}} \right) \times 100

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{75}{125} \right) \times 100
\]

We simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{75}{125} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Now, we multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

\[
\left( \frac{3}{5} \right) \times 100 = 60
\]

So, 60% of the bottle caps are green.

To determine the percentage of green caps, we first need to find out how many green caps Ali has. Since the total number of caps is 125 and Ali has 50 red caps, we can find the number of green caps by subtracting the number of red caps from the total:

\[ \text{Number of green caps} = 125 - 50 = 75 \]

Next, to find the percentage of green caps, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of green caps}}{\text{Total number of caps}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{75}{125} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{3}{5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = 0.6 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = 60\% \]

Now, let's summarize this in reasoning:
1. We found the number of green caps by subtracting the number of red caps from the total number of caps.
2. We then calculated the percentage of green caps using the total number of caps as the denominator.
3. We computed the final percentage, which is 60%.

To determine the percentage of green bottle caps Ali has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the total number of green caps**: 
   - Ali has a total of 125 bottle caps.
   - He has 50 red caps.
   - Therefore, the number of green caps is \( 125 - 50 = 75 \).

2. **Calculate the percentage of green caps**:
   - The formula to calculate percentage is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of green caps}}{\text{Total number of caps}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{75}{125} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{75}{125} = \frac{3}{5}
     \]
   - Convert the fraction to a percentage:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
     \]
     \[
     0.6 \times 100 = 60\%

To find the percentage of green bottle caps, we first need to determine how many green caps Ali has by subtracting the number of red caps from the total number of caps. Then we can calculate the percentage of green caps.

Let's break this down:

1. Total number of caps = 125
2. Number of red caps = 50

Number of green caps = Total number of caps - Number of red caps
Number of green caps = 125 - 50 = 75

Now, to find the percentage of green caps:

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of green caps}}{\text{Total number of caps}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = \left( \frac{75}{125} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = 0.6 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of green caps} = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of Ali's bottle caps are green.
