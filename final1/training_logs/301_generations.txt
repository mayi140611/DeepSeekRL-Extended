###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

240 sixth-grade students were asked about the number of novels they read per month. 1/6 of students read three or more novels, 35% of students read two novels, 5/12 of students read one novel, and the rest of the students do not read anything. Calculate the number of students who do not read novels.

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's first calculate the number of students in each category:

- Students reading three or more novels: \( \frac{1}{6} \times 240 = 40 \)
- Students reading two novels: \( 35\% \times 240 = 0.35 \times 240 = 84 \)
- Students reading one novel: \( \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = 100 \)
- Students not reading novels: \( 240 - (40 + 84 + 100) = 240 - 224 = 16 \)

So, 16 students do not read novels.

First, let's calculate the total number of students who read three or more novels. 1/6 of the students read three or more novels, so:

\[ \text{Students reading 3 or more novels} = \frac{1}{6} \times 240 = 40 \]

Next, we find out how many students read two novels, which is 35% of the total:

\[ \text{Students reading 2 novels} = 35\% \times 240 = 0.35 \times 240 = 84 \]

Then, we calculate how many students read one novel, which is 5/12 of the total:

\[ \text{Students reading 1 novel} = \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = 100 \]

Now, we add up all the students who read novels:

\[ \text{Total students reading novels} = 40 + 84 + 100 = 224 \]

Finally, to find the number of students who do not read novels, we subtract the total number of students reading novels from the total number of students asked:

\[ \text{Students not reading novels} = 240 - 224 = 16 \]

Let's break this down:

1/6 of 240 students read three or more novels:
\( \frac{1}{6} \times 240 = 40 \) students

35% of 240 students read two novels:
\( 0.35 \times 240 = 84 \) students

5/12 of 240 students read one novel:
\( \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = 100 \) students

Now let's add up these groups:
\( 40 + 84 + 100 = 224 \) students

Since we started with 240 students, we subtract the 224 students who read novels to find out how many don't:
\( 240 - 224 = 16 \) students

Therefore, 16 students do not read any novels.

To find the number of students who do not read novels, let's follow the reasoning step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of students who read three or more novels:**
   \[ \text{Number of students reading three or more novels} = \frac{1}{6} \times 240 = 40 \]

2. **Calculate the number of students who read two novels:**
   \[ \text{Number of students reading two novels} = 35\% \times 240 = 0.35 \times 240 = 84 \]

3. **Calculate the number of students who read one novel:**
   \[ \text{Number of students reading one novel} = \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = 100 \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students who read between one and three novels:**
   \[ \text{Total students reading one to three novels} = 40 + 84 + 100 = 224 \]

5. **Calculate the number of students who do not read anything:**
   Since the total number of students is 240:
   \[ \text{Number of students not reading anything} = 240 - 224 = 16 \]

**Answer:** 16 students do not read novels.

To find the number of students who do not read novels, we need to subtract the number of students who read novels from the total number of students.

1/6 * 240 = 40 students read three or more novels.
35% * 240 = 84 students read two novels.
5/12 * 240 = 100 students read one novel.

Now, we add the number of students who read three or more, two, one, and zero novels:
40 + 84 + 100 + 40 = 264 students

Finally, we subtract this from the total number of students to find out how many do not read any novels:
240 - 264 = -24

This result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as you cannot have a negative number of students. Let's re-evaluate the percentages since they are not directly related to the total number of students. However, it seems the percentages are incorrect for the given breakdown.

We'll calculate the number of students based on the given breakdown, and then subtract from the total.

One novel: 5/12 * 240 = 100 students
Two novels: 35% * 240 = 84 students
Three or more novels: 1/6 * 240 = 40 students

Now, let's calculate the number of students who do not read novels by subtracting the total number of students who do read from the total number of students:

240 - (100 + 84 + 40) = 240 - 224 = 16 students

So, 16 students do not read novels.

The total number of students is 240.

The students who read three or more novels is \(1/6 \times 240 = 40\).

The students who read two novels is \(35\% \times 240 = 0.35 \times 240 = 84\).

The students who read one novel is \(5/12 \times 240 = 100\).

Now, to find the number of students who do not read novels, we subtract the sum of students who do read novels from the total number of students.

Thus,
\[240 - (40 + 84 + 100) = 240 - 224 = 16\]

Therefore, the answer is 16.

To calculate the number of students who do not read novels, we first need to determine the number of students in each group.

1. **Students who read three or more novels:**
\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 240 = 40 \]

2. **Students who read two novels:**
\[ 35\% \times 240 = 0.35 \times 240 = 84 \]

3. **Students who read one novel:**
\[ \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = \frac{25}{12} \times 24 = 25 \times 2 = 50 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who read novels by summing up the number of students in each group:

\[ 40 + 84 + 50 = 174 \]

Finally, we subtract this sum from the total number of students to find the number of students who do not read novels:

\[ 240 - 174 = 66 \]

So, the number of students who do not read novels is 66.
