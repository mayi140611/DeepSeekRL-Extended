Let's break down the transactions:

1. Earl owes Fred $28. So Earl's balance is reduced by $28.
2. Fred owes Greg $32. So Fred's balance is reduced by $32.
3. Greg owes Earl $40. So Greg's balance is reduced by $40.

After paying off all the debts, Earl's new balance will be his original balance minus what he owes Fred and Greg minus what Fred owes Greg.

Earl's original balance is $90. After paying Earl his debt to Fred, Earl will have:
$$90 - 28 = 62$$

After Fred pays Earl his debt, Earl's balance will be increased by $32 (since Fred owes $32).

After paying Greg his debt, Earl's balance will be reduced by $40, making it:
$$62 + 32 - 40 = 54$$
Now, let's calculate Greg's balance.

Fred's original balance is $48. After Fred pays Greg his debt, Greg's balance will be:
$$48 + 32 = 80$$
Now Greg owes Earl $40, so Greg's balance will be reduced by $40, making it:
$$80 - 40 = 40$$

When all debts are paid, Greg and Earl will have together:
$$80 + 54 = 134$$

So, Greg and Earl will have $134 together.

Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial amounts**:
   - Earl: $90
   - Fred: $48
   - Greg: $36

2. **Debts and Payments**:
   - Earl owes Fred $28.
   - Fred owes Greg $32.
   - Greg owes Earl $40.

3. **First payment**:
   - Earl pays Fred $28.
     - Earl: $90 - $28 = $62
     - Fred: $48 + $28 = $76
     - Greg: $36 (no impact)

4. **Second payment**:
   - Fred pays Greg $32.
     - Earl: $62 (no change)
     - Fred: $76 - $32 = $44
     - Greg: $36 + $32 = $68

5. **Third payment**:
   - Greg pays Earl $40.
     - Earl: $62 + $40 = $102
     - Fred: $44 (no change)
     - Greg: $68 - $40 = $28

6. **Final amounts**:
   - Earl: $102
   - Greg: $28

7. **Total amount Greg and Earl have together**:
   - Greg + Earl = $28 + $102 = $130

First, we need to determine the final amounts each person has after all debts are settled.

Earl owes Fred $28, so Earl will have $90 - $28 = $62 after paying off the debt.
Fred owes Greg $32, so Fred will have $48 - $32 = $16 after paying off the debt.
Greg owes Earl $40, so Greg will have $36 - $40 = -$4 (which means he still owes Earl $4 after the debts are settled, but we are asked for how much Greg and Earl will have together, not Greg's final amount).

Now both Earl and Greg owe each other $4. So Greg will owe Earl $4 and Earl will owe Greg $4.

Therefore, when all debts are paid, Greg and Earl will together have $62 (Earl's amount after paying off Fred) + $0 (since Greg owes $0) = $62.

But because Greg owes Earl $4 and Earl owes Greg $4, we need to subtract $4 from the total:

$62 - $4 = $58.

So Greg and Earl will together have $58 after all debts are paid.

First, let's calculate how much each person owes and is owed after all debts are paid.

Earl owes Fred $28, so Earl still owes Fred $28. Fred owes Greg $32, so Fred is owed $32 by Greg. Greg owes Earl $40, so Greg is owed $40 by Earl. The amounts are now updated as follows:
- Earl owes Fred $28
- Fred owes Greg $32
- Greg owes Earl $40

Now, let's calculate what each person has left after these transactions.

Initially, Earl has $90, Fred has $48, and Greg has $36.
- After Earl owes Fred $28, Earl has $90 - $28 = $62
- Fred has $48 + $28 = $76
- Greg has $36 + $40 = $76

So, after all debts are paid, Greg has $76 and Earl has $62. Together, Greg and Earl have $76 + $62 = $138.

Earl owes Fred $28 and Fred owes Greg $32. This means the total debt between Earl and Fred is $28, and the total debt between Fred and Greg is $32.

First, let's calculate the total debt between Earl and Fred, then add Fred's balance to this: $76 (28 from Earl's debt to Fred - 48 from Fred's balance).

Now, we know that Fred owes Greg $32. Since all debts are settled, this debt should be subtracted from Fred's total debt: $44 (48 - 32).

Finally, we'll add this balance to Fred's initial amount: $44 + $48 = $92.

So, when all debts are paid, Greg will have $36 and Earl will have $92; together they will have $128.

Let's start by identifying the debts and how they will be paid.

Earl owes Fred $28, so Earl will give Fred $28.
Fred owes Greg $32, so Fred will give Greg $32.
Greg owes Earl $40, so Greg will give Earl $40.

Now, let's calculate the final amounts with the debts paid:

- Earl's final amount: Starting amount + $28 - $40 (earlier debt to Greg) = $90 + $28 - $40 = $78
- Fred's final amount: Starting amount + $32 = $48 + $32 = $80
- Greg's final amount: Starting amount + $40 = $36 + $40 = $76

When all debts are paid, the total amount of money that Greg and Earl will have together is:
$78 (Earl) + $76 (Greg) = $154

Initially, the debts are as follows:
- Earl owes Fred $28.
- Fred owes Greg $32.
- Greg owes Earl $40.

When all debts are paid:
1. Fred pays Earl $28, so Fred's remaining debt to Greg becomes $32 - $28 = $4.
2. Greg pays Earl $40, so Greg's remaining debt to Fred becomes $32 + $40 = $72.

After all debts are paid, Earl's total will be $90 + $72 = $162.
Fred's total will be $48 - $28 = $20.
Greg's total will be $36 + $40 = $76.

Adding Greg's and Earl's totals together:
$76 + $162 = $238.

So, when all debts are paid, Greg and Earl will have a total of $238 together.

Initially, the amounts of money each person has are as follows:
- Earl: $90
- Fred: $48
- Greg: $36

Now we account for debts that are owed:
- Earl owes Fred $28.
- Fred owes Greg $32.
- Greg owes Earl $40.

To find out how much money will be exchanged when all debts are paid, we first determine the net debts of each person:
- Earl has $90 and owes $28 to Fred, so Earl's net debt is $90 - $28 = $62.
- Fred has $48 and owes $32 to Greg, so Fred's net debt is $48 - $32 = $16.
- Greg had $36 and owes $40 to Earl, so Greg's net debt is $36 - $40 = -$4. 

After debts are paid, we need to find the combined debt amounts:
- Fred's effective debt to Earl is $16 - $40 = -$24.
- Fred owes $16, and Greg owes $40, but it effectively balances out when paying Earl.

Thus, the total money they will have together is:
\[ Earl: \$90 \]
\[ Greg: \$36 \]

Therefore, the total amount is \( 90 + 36 = \$126 \).

So, when all debts are paid, Earl and Greg will have a total of $126.

Earl owes Fred $28 so give $28 to Fred. He will then have $90 - $28 = $62. Fred owed him $28 so he will give him $28 and will have $48+ $28 = $76 after receiving the money from Earl.

Fred now owes Greg $32 and he already has $76, so he needs to pay $32 to Greg, he will remain $76 - 32 = $44 after paying.

Greg owes Earl $40 and he already owes Fred $32, so he will end up with $36 + $32 = $68 when he pays Fred $32.

When all is paid, Greg will have $68, and Earl will have $62 + $40 = $102.

First, calculate the total amount owed by each person to the others.

Earl owes Fred $28.
Fred owes Greg $32.
Greg owes Earl $40.

The total amount owed can be calculated as follows:
- Earl owes Fred $28 and receives nothing from this debt (since it's a mutual loan).
- Fred owes Greg $32 and receives $32 from this debt, so it balances out.
- Greg owes Earl $40 and receives nothing from this debt (since it's a mutual loan).

So, the total debt between Earl and Greg is $40.

Fred's net effect: He receives $32 from Earl and owes $32 to Greg, resulting in no net debt.

Earl's net effect: He owes Fred $28 and receives nothing in return, resulting in a net debt of $28.

Greg's net effect: He owes Earl $40 and receives nothing in return, resulting in a net debt of $40.

Total amount owed between Fred, Earl, and Greg: $28 (Earl) + $0 (Fred, net debt) + $40 (Greg) = $68.

Now, if all debts are paid, Greg will receive his $40, and Earl will need to pay Earl for the remaining debt of $28.

To solve this, we need to trace the amounts each person owes and owing. Earl starts with $90 and owes Fred $28. So, Earl owes $28 and still has $90. 

Fred owes $28 to Greg and receives $32 from Earl. After this transaction, Fred will have $48 + $32 = $80 and Greg will have $36 - $28 = $8.

Now Greg owes $40 to Earl and receives $28 from Fred. So, after paying Earl, Greg will have $8 + $28 = $36.

Now Earl owes $28 to Fred, Fred will owe Earl $28, and Earl has $90 - $28 = $62. Fred will have $80 + $28 = $108 and Earl will have $62 - $28 = $34.

When all debts are paid, Fred will have $108 and Earl will have $34, making a total of Fred's $108 plus Earl's $34, which is $142.

Earl's net amount: $90 - $28 - $40 = $22
Fred's net amount: (-$28) + $48 - $32 = $28 - $32 = -$4 (Fred owes $4)
Greg's net amount: $40 + $36 = $76

To determine how much Greg and Earl will have together after all debts are paid, let's break down the transactions:

1. Earl owes Fred $28.
2. Fred owes Greg $32.
3. Greg owes Earl $40.

First, let's calculate how much each person will end up owing after these transactions:

- Earl starts with $90 and owes Fred $28. So, Earl will owe Fred $28.
- Fred starts with $48 and now owes $32 to Greg. So, Fred will owe Greg $32.
- Greg starts with $36 and now owes $40 to Earl. So, Greg will owe Earl $40.

So, after all debts are paid, Earl will owe Fred $28 + $32 = $60, and Fred will owe Greg $32. This means that Fred owes nothing to Greg initially, and Greg will also owe $32 to Fred initially. Therefore, Greg and Earl will owe each other $60 and $32 respectively.

Now, let's add the amounts Greg and Earl will have together:

- Earl will owe Fred $60, so Earl will still have $90 - $60 = $30.
- Greg will have $36 and will owe Fred $32. So, Greg will owe Fred $32 - $36 = -$4 (meaning Greg will have $4 more).

Therefore, Greg will have $4 more than Earl.

So, Greg and Earl together will have $30 (Earl) + $34 (Greg) = $64.
