system
To determine Noah's sales for this month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sales from last month.
2. Determine the double of last month's sales.
3. Provide the final amount of sales for this month.

Step 1: Calculate the sales from last month.
Noah sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings last month.
The sales from large paintings last month should be:
\[ 8 \text{ large paintings} \times \$60 \text{ per large painting} = \$480 \]

The sales from small paintings last month should be:
\[ 4 \text{ small paintings} \times \$30 \text{ per small painting} = \$120 \]

Therefore, the total sales from last month are:
\[ \$480 + \$120 = \$600 \]

Step 2: Determine the double of last month's sales.
Noah sold twice as much this month as last month.
\[ 2 \times \$600 = \$1200 \]

Step 3: Provide the final amount of sales for this month.

Therefore, the sales for this month are:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]

To find out how much Noah earned this month, we first need to calculate his earnings from last month.

Last month's earnings:
- Earnings from large paintings: 8 large paintings * $60 per large painting = $480
- Earnings from small paintings: 4 small paintings * $30 per small painting = $120
- Total earnings last month: $480 + $120 = $600

Now, we know that Noah sold twice as much this month as last month. So, the sales this month would be:

Sales this month = 2 * Sales last month
Sales this month = 2 * $600
Sales this month = $1200

Therefore, Noah's sales for this month are $1200.

To determine Noah's sales for this month, we first need to calculate his total sales for last month. 

Last month, Noah sold 8 large paintings at $60 each and 4 small paintings at $30 each. 

The revenue from large paintings was \(8 \times 60 = $480\).

The revenue from small paintings was \(4 \times 30 = $120\).

So, the total sales for last month were \(480 + 120 = $600\).

This month, he sold twice as much. Therefore, his sales for this month would be \(600 \times 2 = $1200\).

Thus, Noah's sales for this month are \( \$1200 \).

To determine Noah's sales for this month, we need to calculate his total revenue from large and small paintings last month and then double that amount given the information that he sold twice as much this month.

First, calculate the revenue from large paintings:
- Noah sold 8 large paintings.
- Each large painting costs $60.

\[ 8 \text{ large paintings} \times \$60 \text{ per large painting} = \$480 \]

Next, calculate the revenue from small paintings:
- Noah sold 4 small paintings.
- Each small painting costs $30.

\[ 4 \text{ small paintings} \times \$30 \text{ per small painting} = \$120 \]

Now, find the total revenue from both types of paintings:
\[ \$480 + \$120 = \$600 \]

Since he sold twice as much this month, we double the total revenue:
\[ 2 \times \$600 = \$1200 \]

Therefore, Noah's sales for this month are \(\$1200\).

First, calculate the revenue from the large paintings:

Since he sold twice as much this month, we double the last month's revenue:
\[
\text{Revenue for this month} = 2 \times \$600 = \$1200

Therefore, Noah's sales for this month are:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much Noah earned last month. He sold eight large paintings at $60 each and four small paintings at $30 each.

Last month's earnings calculation:

\[
\text{Total earnings last month} = (\text{Number of large paintings}) \times (\text{Price per large painting}) + (\text{Number of small paintings}) \times (\text{Price per small painting})
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings last month} = (8 \times 60) + (4 \times 30)
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings last month} = 480 + 120
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings last month} = 600
\]

Now, according to the problem, Noah sold twice as much this month. So, we need to determine how many paintings he sold this month.

\[
\text{Total paintings sold this month} = 2 \times (\text{Total paintings sold last month})
\]

\[
\text{Total paintings sold this month} = 2 \times (8 + 4)
\]

\[
\text{Total paintings sold this month} = 2 \times 12
\]

\[
\text{Total paintings sold this month} = 24
\]

Finally, we determine the total earnings for this month by multiplying the number of paintings sold this month by the price per painting.

\[
\text{Total earnings this month} = (\text{Number of large paintings sold this month}) \times (\text{Price per large painting}) + (\text{Number of small paintings sold this month}) \times (\text{Price per small painting})
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings this month} = (24 \times 60) + (24 \times 30)
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings this month} = 1440 + 720
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings this month} = 2160
\]

So, Noah's sales for this month are \(\boxed{2160}\).

To determine Noah's sales for this month, we first need to calculate his total sales from last month. 

From the information provided:
- Noah sold 8 large paintings last month, each priced at $60.
- Noah sold 4 small paintings last month, each priced at $30.

The total sales from last month can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total sales from large paintings} = 8 \times 60 = 480 \]
\[ \text{Total sales from small paintings} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total sales for last month is:
\[ \text{Total sales last month} = 480 + 120 = 600 \]

Since Noah sold twice as much this month, we need to calculate the total sales for this month:
\[ \text{Total sales this month} = 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

Thus, Noah's sales for this month is $1200.

First, let's calculate the total amount Noah made from his sales last month:

$60 per large painting * 8 large paintings = $480 from large paintings
$30 per small painting * 4 small paintings = $120 from small paintings

Total sales from last month = $480 + $120 = $600

Since he sold twice as much this month, we need to multiply his total sales from last month by 2:

Total sales for this month = $600 * 2 = $1200

To calculate Noah's sales for this month, we first need to determine how much he earned last month by multiplying the price of each type of painting by the number of paintings sold and then adding the results.

For large paintings:
Price per large painting = $60
Number of large paintings sold last month = 8
Sales from large paintings last month = 8 * $60 = $480

For small paintings:
Price per small painting = $30
Number of small paintings sold last month = 4
Sales from small paintings last month = 4 * $30 = $120

Total sales last month:
Total sales last month = Sales from large paintings + Sales from small paintings
Total sales last month = $480 + $120 = $600

If he sold twice as much this month, we need to double his total sales from last month.

Sales this month = 2 * Total sales last month
Sales this month = 2 * $600 = $1200

Therefore, his sales for this month are $1200.

To determine Noah's sales for this month, we first need to calculate his total sales last month.

Number of large paintings sold last month = 8
Cost per large painting = $60

Sales from large paintings last month = Number of large paintings sold last month × Cost per large painting
= 8 × $60
= $480

Number of small paintings sold last month = 4
Cost per small painting = $30

Sales from small paintings last month = Number of small paintings sold last month × Cost per small painting
= 4 × $30
= $120

Total sales last month = Sales from large paintings + Sales from small paintings
= $480 + $120
= $600

Now, since he sold twice as much this month, we multiply the total sales from last month by 2.

Sales this month = Total sales last month × 2
= $600 × 2
= $1200

Therefore, Noah's sales for this month are $1200.
