I went to the music shop and there were CDs of The Life Journey for $100, A Day a Life for $50, and When You Rescind for $85 on display. If I bought 3 of each CD to share with my friends, what's the total amount of money I spent in the shop?

To determine the total amount of money you spent, we need to calculate the cost of one set of CDs (3 of each CD) for each album and then multiply by the number of albums you bought. 

First, let's calculate the cost for The Life Journey:
\[ \text{Cost per set} = 3 \times \$100 = \$300 \]

Next, for A Day a Life:
\[ \text{Cost per set} = 3 \times \$50 = \$150 \]

And for When You Rescind:
\[ \text{Cost per set} = 3 \times \$85 = \$255 \]

Now, we add up the costs for all three sets:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$300 + \$150 + \$255 = \$705 \]

So, the total amount of money you spent is \$705.

The total cost for each CD type is the price of one CD multiplied by the quantity you plan to buy. For The Life Journey CDs, you bought 3, which costs \(3 \times \$100 = \$300\). For A Day a Life CDs, you bought 3, which costs \(3 \times \$50 = \$150\). For When You Rescind CDs, you bought 3, which costs \(3 \times \$85 = \$255\). The total amount of money you spent is the sum of these individual costs: \(300 + 150 + 255 = \$705\).

Let's break down the cost of each CD and then calculate the total amount spent.

- The Life Journey CD costs $100.
- A Day a Life CD costs $50.
- When You Rescind CD costs $85.

If you bought 3 of each CD, the total cost per CD is:
- The Life Journey: \(3 \times 100 = 300\) dollars
- A Day a Life: \(3 \times 50 = 150\) dollars
- When You Rescind: \(3 \times 85 = 255\) dollars

Now, let's add up the totals:
- Total cost of The Life Journey CDs: \(300\) dollars
- Total cost of A Day a Life CDs: \(150\) dollars
- Total cost of When You Rescind CDs: \(255\) dollars

The total amount of money spent is:
\[300 + 150 + 255 = 705\]

Therefore, the total amount of money you spent in the shop is $705.

To determine the total amount of money spent, let's break down the purchases:

1. CDs of "The Life Journey" cost $100 each. If you bought 3 of them, the cost would be \(3 \times \$100 = \$300\).
2. CDs of "A Day a Life" cost $50 each. If you bought 3 of them, the cost would be \(3 \times \$50 = \$150\).
3. CDs of "When You Rescind" cost $85 each. If you bought 3 of them, the cost would be \(3 \times \$85 = \$255\).

Now, to calculate the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of each type of CD together:

\[
\$300 + \$150 + \$255 = \$705
\]

So, the total amount of money spent in the shop is $705.

Each CD purchase cost $100, $50, and $85 respectively. You bought 3 of each CD. 
To find the total amount spent, you would multiply the price of each CD by the number of CDs purchased for each type and then add them together.

Total spent on The Life Journey CDs: 3 CDs * $100/CD = $300
Total spent on A Day a Life CDs: 3 CDs * $50/CD = $150
Total spent on When You Rescind CDs: 3 CDs * $85/CD = $255

Now add up the totals:
Total spent = $300 + $150 + $255 = $705

Therefore, the total amount of money you spent in the shop is $705.

To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the cost for each type of CD and then sum them up. 

For The Life Journey: 3 CDs x $100 per CD = $300
For A Day a Life: 3 CDs x $50 per CD = $150
For When You Rescind: 3 CDs x $85 per CD = $255

Now, we add these amounts together:
$300 (The Life Journey) + $150 (A Day a Life) + $255 (When You Rescind) = $705

Therefore, the total amount of money spent is $705.
