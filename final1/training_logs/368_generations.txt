Linda spent $4 on two coloring books, which amounts to $4 \times 2 = $8. She spent $1.50 on 4 packs of peanuts, which amounts to $1.50 \times 4 = $6. The total cost of the coloring books and peanuts is $8 + $6 = $14. Since she gave the cashier $25 and got no change, the total cost plus the stuffed animal is $25. Therefore, the stuffed animal costs $25 - $14 = $11.

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine the cost of the stuffed animal, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items Linda bought, and then subtract that from the amount she gave the cashier.

Linda bought:
- 2 coloring books: $4 each, so \(2 \times 4 = $8\)
- 4 packs of peanuts: $1.50 each, so \(4 \times 1.50 = $6\)
- 1 stuffed animal

The total cost of these items is $8 (coloring books) + $6 (peanuts) = $14.

Linda gave the cashier $25 and received no change, which means the total cost of the items was exactly what she gave to the cashier.

So, the cost of the stuffed animal is the total amount minus the cost of the coloring books and peanuts. Therefore, the cost of the stuffed animal is:

\(25 - 14 = $11\).

The stuffed animal costs $11.

To find the cost of the stuffed animal, let's start by calculating the total cost of the other items Linda bought.

1. **Coloring Books**: 
   - Linda bought 2 coloring books at $4 each.
   - Total cost for coloring books: \(2 \times 4 = \$8\).

2. **Peanuts**:
   - Linda bought 4 packs of peanuts at $1.50 each pack.
   - Total cost for peanuts: \(4 \times 1.50 = \$6\).

3. **Adding the Total Costs**:
   - Total cost for coloring books and peanuts: \(8 + 6 = \$14\).

4. **Given Total with Change**:
   - Linda gave the cashier $25 and got no change.
   - Total amount paid: \(25\).

5. **Calculating the Stuffed Animal Cost**:
   - To find the cost of the stuffed animal, subtract the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts from the total amount paid.
   - Cost of stuffed animal: \(25 - 14 = \$11\).

Therefore, the cost of the stuffed animal is \( \$11 \).

Let's start by calculating the total cost of the items Linda bought, excluding the stuffed animal.

- Two coloring books cost \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- Four packs of peanuts cost \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.
So, the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts is \(8 + 6 = 14\) dollars.

Since Linda gave the cashier $25 and got no change, her total purchase was $25. Therefore, the cost of the stuffed animal is \(25 - 14 = 11\) dollars.

Let's calculate the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts first:

- Two coloring books at $4 each: \(2 \times $4 = $8\)
- Four packs of peanuts at $1.50 each: \(4 \times $1.50 = $6\)

Adding these together gives the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts: \( $8 + $6 = $14 \)

Linda gave the cashier $25 and got no change, which means the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts plus the stuffed animal equals $25. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the stuffed animal by subtracting the cost of the coloring books and peanuts from $25:

\( $25 - $14 = $11 \)

So, a stuffed animal costs $11.

Let's break down the costs of the items Linda bought:

1. The two coloring books: 2 * $4 = $8
2. The 4 packs of peanuts: 4 * $1.50 = $6
3. The stuffed animal: Let's call this x

Now, we know that the total amount spent is the total amount given to the cashier minus the change received, which is $25:

Total spent = $25 - $0 = $25

So, the total cost of the coloring books, peanuts, and the stuffed animal is $25:

Total cost = $8 + $6 + x = $25

Now we can solve for x (the cost of the stuffed animal) by subtracting the known costs from the total:

x = $25 - ($8 + $6)
x = $25 - $14
x = $11

The cost of the stuffed animal is $11.

To determine the cost of the stuffed animal, let's first calculate the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts, and then subtract that from the total amount Linda gave to the cashier.

The cost of the coloring books is:
2 coloring books * $4 per coloring book = $8

The cost of the peanuts is:
4 packs * $1.50 per pack = $6

The total cost of the coloring books and peanuts is:
$8 + $6 = $14

Linda gave the cashier $25. After subtracting the cost of the coloring books and peanuts, the amount remaining for the stuffed animal is:
$25 - $14 = $11

Therefore, the stuffed animal costs $11.

First, calculate the total cost of the coloring books:

Next, calculate the total cost of the packs of peanuts:
4 packs * $1.50 each = $6

Now, add the costs of the coloring books and packs of peanuts:
$8 + $6 = $14

We know that Linda gave $25 to the cashier and got no change, which means she spent exactly what she gave. Therefore, the cost of the stuffed animal can be calculated by subtracting the combined cost of the coloring books and packs of peanuts from the total amount she gave:
$25 - $14 = $11

So, the stuffed animal cost $11.

Let's denote the cost of the stuffed animal as \( x \).

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the coloring books and the packs of peanuts:
- Cost of two coloring books: \( 2 \times \$4 = \$8 \)
- Cost of four packs of peanuts: \( 4 \times \$1.50 = \$6 \)

Add these together to find the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts:
\[ \$8 + \$6 = \$14 \]

Linda gave the cashier $25, so the cost of the stuffed animal must make up the difference between what she gave and the total cost of the other items:
\[ \$25 - \$14 = \$11 \]

Therefore, the cost of the stuffed animal is \( \$11 \).

Let's break down the cost step by step:

1. Linda bought two coloring books for $4 each, so the total for coloring books is \(2 \times $4 = $8\).

2. She bought 4 packs of peanuts at $1.50 each, so the total for peanuts is \(4 \times $1.50 = $6\).

3. Let's denote the cost of the stuffed animal as \(x\).

4. The total amount Linda spent is the sum of the cost of the coloring books, peanuts, and the stuffed animal: \(8 + 6 + x\).

5. She gave the cashier $25 and got no change, so the total cost is $25.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[8 + 6 + x = 25\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[14 + x = 25\]
\[x = 25 - 14\]
\[x = 11\]

The cost of the stuffed animal is $11.

1. Linda bought two coloring books at $4 each, so the total cost for coloring books is \(2 \times \$4 = \$8\).
2. She bought 4 packs of peanuts at $1.50 each pack, so the total cost for peanuts is \(4 \times \$1.50 = \$6\).
3. Let's assume the cost of the stuffed animal is \(x\).

The total amount spent is the sum of the costs of the coloring books, peanuts, and the stuffed animal, which should equal the amount Linda gave to the cashier. So, the equation would be:
\[
\$8 + \$6 + x = \$25
\]
Now, let's solve for \(x\):

Subtracting the costs of the coloring books and peanuts from $25, we get:
\[
\$25 - (\$8 + \$6) = \$25 - \$14 = \$11
\]
So, the stuffed animal costs \(x = \$11\).

To find the cost of the stuffed animal, we need to calculate the total cost of the coloring books, peanuts, and then subtract that from the $25 Linda gave the cashier.

Calculations:

1. Cost of two coloring books:
   Total cost = 2 coloring books * $4 each
   = 2 * $4
   = $8

2. Cost of 4 packs of peanuts:
   Total cost = 4 packs of peanuts * $1.50 each
   = 4 * $1.50
   = $6.00

3. Total cost of coloring books and peanuts:
   Total cost before stuffed animal = Cost of coloring books + Cost of peanuts
   = $8 + $6.00
   = $14.00

4. Total amount given to the cashier:
   Total spent = $25

5. Cost of the stuffed animal:
   Cost of stuffed animal = Total amount given - Total spent
   = $25 - $14.00
   = $11.00

To find out how much the stuffed animal costs, we need to calculate the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts, and then subtract this from the $25 Linda gave to the cashier.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coloring books:
\[ \text{Cost of coloring books} = 2 \times \$4 = \$8 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the peanuts:
\[ \text{Cost of peanuts} = 4 \times \$1.50 = \$6 \]

Now, we add the cost of the coloring books and peanuts to find the total cost before adding the stuffed animal:
\[ \text{Total cost of coloring books and peanuts} = \$8 + \$6 = \$14 \]

Since Linda gave the cashier $25 and got no change, the stuffed animal must fit into this amount:
\[ \text{Cost of the stuffed animal} = \$25 - \$14 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the stuffed animal} = \$11 \]

Therefore, the stuffed animal costs $11.
