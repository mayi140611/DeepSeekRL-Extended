#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
The total amount John paid is 4 quarters + 3 dimes + 1 nickel. Quarters are worth 25 cents, dimes are worth 10 cents, and a nickel is 5 cents. So the calculation is:

\[ 4 * 25 + 3 * 10 + 1 * 5 = 100 + 30 + 5 = 135 \, \text{cents} \]

He received 4 cents back in change, so the cost of the candy bar is:

\[ 135 - 4 = 131 \, \text{cents} \]

To determine the cost of the candy bar, we need to calculate the total amount John paid and then subtract the change he received.

First, let's convert each of the coins John used to cents:
- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents.

John paid using:
- 4 quarters, which is \(4 \times 25 = 100\) cents.
- 3 dimes, which is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) cents.
- 1 nickel, which is \(1 \times 5 = 5\) cents.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount John paid:
\[100 + 30 + 5 = 135\] cents.

John received 4 cents back in change. Therefore, the cost of the candy bar is:
\[135 - 4 = 131\] cents.

So, the cost of the candy bar is 131 cents.

Let's first calculate the total amount John paid with his coins:

- He had 4 quarters, which is \(4 \times 25 = 100\) cents.
- He had 3 dimes, which is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) cents.
- He had 1 nickel, which is \(1 \times 5 = 5\) cents.

Adding these amounts together, we get the total payment:

\[100 + 30 + 5 = 135\] cents.

John received 4 cents back in change, so the cost of the candy bar was:

\[135 - 4 = 131\] cents.

Therefore, the cost of the candy bar was 131 cents.

The total amount John paid with his quarters and dimes was 4 quarters * 25 cents + 3 dimes * 10 cents + 1 nickel * 5 cents. Let's calculate the total cost of the candy bar:

\[ \text{Total payment} = (4 \times 25) + (3 \times 10) + (1 \times 5) = 100 + 30 + 5 = 135 \text{ cents} \]

John got 4 cents back in change, so the original price of the candy bar must have been 135 cents - 4 cents = 131 cents.

To find the cost of the candy bar, we need to calculate the total amount of money John paid with and then subtract the change he received.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John paid:

- 4 quarters = 4 * $0.25 = $1.00
- 3 dimes = 3 * $0.10 = $0.30
- 1 nickel = $0.05

Now, let's add these amounts together to get the total payment:
Total payment = $1.00 + $0.30 + $0.05 = $1.35

John received $0.04 in change. To find the cost of the candy bar, we subtract the change from the total payment:

Cost of candy bar = Total payment - Change
Cost of candy bar = $1.35 - $0.04
Cost of candy bar = $1.31

Therefore, the candy bar cost 131 cents.

To solve this problem, we first calculate the total amount of money John paid with, and then subtract the change he received to find the cost of the candy bar.

1. Count the value of each type of coin John used:
   - 4 quarters = 4 * 25 cents = 100 cents
   - 3 dimes = 3 * 10 cents = 30 cents
   - 1 nickel = 5 cents

2. Sum the values to find the total amount of money paid:
   - Total paid = 100 cents (quarters) + 30 cents (dimes) + 5 cents (nickel) = 135 cents

3. Subtract the change John received to find the cost of the candy bar:
   - Cost of candy bar = Total paid - Change in cents
   - Cost of candy bar = 135 cents - 4 cents = 131 cents

Therefore, the candy bar cost 131 cents.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John paid with.

He used 4 quarters, which is \(4 \times 25 = 100\) cents.
He used 3 dimes, which is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) cents, plus a nickel which is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cents.

So, the total amount of money he paid is \(100 + 30 + 15 = 145\) cents.

He got 4 cents back in change, so the cost of the candy bar is the total amount paid minus the change received.

Therefore, the cost of the candy bar is \(145 - 4 = 141\) cents.
