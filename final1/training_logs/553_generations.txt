To determine how many people would play football out of a group of 250, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the percentage of people who like football out of the total group:**
   - Given that 24 out of every 60 individuals like football, we can calculate the percentage:
     \[
     \text{Percentage liking football} = \frac{24}{60} \times 100\% = 40\%
     \]

2. **Calculate how many people in the group of 250 like football:**
   - If 40% of the group of 250 people like football, then:
     \[
     \text{Number of people who like football} = 40\% \text{ of } 250 = 0.40 \times 250 = 100
     \]

3. **Determine the percentage of those who like football that also play it:**
   - 50% of the people who like football play it.

4. **Calculate how many people in the group of 250 play football:**
   - Since 50% of those who like football also play it, the number of people who play football is:
     \[
     \text{Number of people who play football} = 50\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.50 \times 100 = 50
     \]

**Conclusion:**
Out of a group of 250 people, you would expect 50 to play football.

To find out how many people would play football out of a group of 250, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. First, we need to determine the proportion of people in the group who like football. Since 24 out of every 60 individuals like football, we can calculate the proportion as:
    \[
    \frac{24}{60} = 0.4
    \]
   This means that 40% of the population likes football.

2. Next, we need to find out how many people in a group of 250 like football. Since we know that 40% of the group likes football, we can calculate the number of people who like football as:
    \[
    0.4 \times 250 = 100
    \]
   So, 100 people in the group would like football.

3. Out of those 100 people who like football, 50% play it. Therefore, the number of people who play football is:
    \[
    0.5 \times 100 = 50
    \]
   So, 50 people would play football out of the group of 250.

To determine how many people would play football out of a group of 250, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the proportion of individuals who like football.
2. Then, determine what proportion of these individuals play football.
3. Finally, apply this proportion to the group of 250 to find out how many would play football.

Given:
- 24 out of every 60 individuals like football.
- Out of those that like it, 50% play it.

Let's start with step 1.

The proportion of individuals who like football is:
\[ \frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Next, for step 2:
The proportion of these individuals who play it is 50%, or \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, applying this to the group of 250:
\[ \text{Number of people playing football} = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 250 \]

\[ = \frac{2}{5} \times 250 = 100 \]

Therefore, we would expect 100 people to play football out of a group of 250.

To find the number of people who play football out of a group of 250, we can use the given ratio of individuals who like football to those who play it and the total group size.

First, let's calculate how many people like football in a group of 250:
\[ \text{Number of people who like football} = \frac{24}{60} \times 250 \]

\[ = \frac{24}{60} \times 250 \]
\[ = 0.4 \times 250 \]
\[ = 100 \]

Now, since 50% of those who like football play it, the number of people who play football is:
\[ \text{Number of people who play football} = 50\% \times 100 \]

\[ = 0.5 \times 100 \]
\[ = 50 \]

So, we would expect 50 people out of a group of 250 to play football.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. First, we calculate the proportion of people out of the total that like football. Given that 24 out of 60 like football, the proportion is 24/60 = 2/5.

2. Next, we determine how much 50% of the group of 250 might look like. To find the number of people that would play football, we'll multiply the total number of people by the proportion that like football. So, 250 * 2/5 = 50 people.

3. To verify that the number of people who like football within this group of 250 is around the expected 24 out of every 60, we can perform the same calculation using 250 people: 250 * 2/5 = 100 people. This could indicate that the group was slightly larger than expected, leading to this being slightly larger, but it is still a reasonable expected number based on the given percentage.

4. Among these people that like football, 50% play football. Therefore, we'll multiply the total number of football lovers by 50% to get the number of football players: 100 * (50/100) = 50 people. This confirms that 50 people would be expected to play football out of the 250 person group.

Explanation:
1. First, we need to find the ratio of individuals who like football out of the total group. Given that 24 out of 60 like football, the ratio is 24/60.
2. Now, we simplify this ratio: 24/60 can be reduced to 2/5 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 12.
3. This means that for every 5 individuals in the group, 2 like football.
4. Next, we know that out of those who like football, 50% play football. Therefore, the number of people who play football out of those who like it is 2/5 * 50% = 20%.

Now, to find the number of people who play football out of a group of 250:
1. We calculate the number of individuals who like football: 2/5 * 250 = 100.
2. Then, we calculate the number of people who play football: 100 * 50% = 100 men.

So, out of a group of 250, we would expect 100 people to play football.

To determine how many people you would expect to play football out of a group of 250, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the proportion of individuals who like football.
2. Use this proportion to find out how many like football in a group of 250.
3. Then, calculate how many of those who like football also play it (50% of those who like it).

First, 24 out of every 60 individuals like football, so the proportion of individuals who like football is:
\[ \text{Proportion} = \frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Next, if we have a group of 250 individuals, the number who like football is:
\[ \text{Number who like football} = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100 \]

Out of those who like football, 50% play it, so the number of people who play football is:
\[ \text{Number who play football} = 100 \times \frac{50}{100} = 50 \]

So, you would expect 50 people to play football out of a group of 250.

Next, we understand that 50% of these individuals who like football actually play it:

\[ \text{Proportion that play football} = 0.4 \times 0.5 = 0.2 \]

This gives us a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) that any given person likes football and also plays it.

Now, we can calculate the expected number of people who play football in a group of 250:

\[ \text{Expected number of players} = 250 \times 0.2 = 50 \]

To solve this, first, we find out how many individuals in a group of 250 like football based on the given ratio. Since 24 out of 60 individuals like football, we can set up a proportion to find out how many like football in a group of 250:
\[
\frac{24}{60} = \frac{x}{250}
\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{24}{60} \times 250 = 10 \times 25 = 250
\]
So, there are approximately 250 individuals like football in a group of 250.

Next, we find out how many of those individuals that like football actually play it. Since 50% of those that like football play it, we calculate:
\[
\frac{50}{100} \times 250 = 0.5 \times 250 = 125
