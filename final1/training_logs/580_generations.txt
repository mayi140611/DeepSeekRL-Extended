Let's denote your current age as \( x \) and your brother's current age as \( y \).

According to the problem, in ten years, your age will be twice your brother's age:

\[ x + 10 = 2(y + 10) \]

And the sum of your ages in ten years will be 45:

\[ (x + 10) + (y + 10) = 45 \]

Let's solve this system of equations.

First, let's expand and simplify the second equation:

\[ x + 10 + y + 10 = 45 \]
\[ x + y + 20 = 45 \]
\[ x + y = 25 \]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( x + 2y = 30 \) (from the first equation, after distributing)
2. \( x + y = 25 \)

Subtract the second equation from the first to solve for \( y \):

\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 30 - 25 \]
\[ y = 5 \]

With \( y = 5 \), we can substitute this back into the second equation to solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 5 = 25 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, you are currently 20 years old.

Let's denote your current age as \( x \) and your brother's current age as \( y \).

According to the problem, in ten years, you will be twice as old as your brother. This can be written as:
\[ x + 10 = 2(y + 10) \]

Also, the sum of your ages in ten years will be 45 years:
\[ x + 10 + y + 10 = 45 \]
\[ x + y + 20 = 45 \]
\[ x + y = 25 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( x + 10 = 2y + 20 \)
2. \( x + y = 25 \)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

First, isolate \( x \) in the second equation:
\[ x = 25 - y \]

Substitute this into the first equation:
\[ 25 - y + 10 = 2y + 20 \]
\[ 25 - y + 10 = 2y + 20 \]
\[ 35 - y = 2y + 20 \]
\[ 35 - 20 = 3y \]
\[ 15 = 3y \]
\[ y = 5 \]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - y \]
\[ x = 25 - 5 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, you are 20 years old now.

Let's denote your current age as \( x \) years old, and your brother's current age as \( y \) years old. According to the problem, in ten years, you will be twice your brother's age, and the sum of your ages in ten years will be 45 years.

So, after ten years:

1. Your age will be \( x + 10 \).
2. Your brother's age will be \( y + 10 \).

From the first statement, in ten years, you will be twice your brother's age, we can write:

\[ x + 10 = 2(y + 10) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x + 10 = 2y + 20 \]
\[ x - 2y = 10 \]  ---- (1)

The second statement tells us that the sum of your ages in ten years will be 45, so:

\[ (x + 10) + (y + 10) = 45 \]
\[ x + y + 20 = 45 \]
\[ x + y = 25 \]  -----(2)

Now we have a system of two equations:
\[ x - 2y = 10 \]
\[ x + y = 25 \]

Let's solve this system of equations step-by-step.

By adding these two equations, we eliminate \( y \) and solve for \( x \):

\[ (x - 2y) + (x + y) = 10 + 25 \]
\[ 2x - y = 35 \]

Substitute \( x = 25 - y \) from equation (2) into the above equation:

\[ 2(25 - y) - y = 35 \]
\[ 50 - 2y - y = 35 \]
\[ 50 - 3y = 35 \]
\[ -3y = 35 - 50 \]
\[ -3y = -15 \]
\[ y = 5 \]

So, your brother is currently 5 years old. Now, substituting \( y = 5 \) back into equation (2):

\[ x + 5 = 25 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Therefore, you are currently 20 years old.

Let's denote your current age as \( y \) and your brother's current age as \( b \). According to the problem:

1. In ten years, your age will be \( y + 10 \), and your brother's age will be \( b + 10 \).
2. The problem states that in ten years, you will be twice your brother's age, so we have the equation: \( y + 10 = 2(b + 10) \).
3. The sum of your ages in ten years will be 45, so we have the equation: \( y + 10 + b + 10 = 45 \) (because the sum of the two ages will be 45 in ten years).

Now let's solve these equations step by step.

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\( y + 10 = 2(b + 10) \)
\( y + 10 = 2b + 20 \)
\( y - 2b = 10 \) ... (1)

Next, let's simplify the second equation:
\( y + 10 + b + 10 = 45 \)
\( y + b + 20 = 45 \)
\( y + b = 25 \) ... (2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
1. \( y - 2b = 10 \)
2. \( y + b = 25 \)

Let's solve this system. First, we'll subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1) to eliminate \( y \):
\( (y - 2b) - (y + b) = 10 - 25 \)
\( y - 2b - y - b = -15 \)
\( -3b = -15 \)

Now we divide both sides by -3:
\( b = 5 \)

Now we know your brother's current age is 5. Let's substitute \( b = 5 \) back into Equation (2):
\( y + 5 = 25 \)
\( y = 20 \)

So, your current age is 20 years old.

Let's denote your current age by \( X \) and your brother's current age by \( Y \).

From the problem statement, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. In ten years, you will be twice your brother's age. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   X + 10 = 2(Y + 10)
   \]
   
2. The sum of your ages in ten years will be 45 years old. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   (X + 10) + (Y + 10) = 45
   \]

Let's simplify and solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand and simplify the first equation:
\[
X + 10 = 2Y + 20
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
X = 2Y + 10
\]

Next, let's expand and simplify the second equation:
\[
X + Y + 20 = 45
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
X + Y = 25
\]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( X = 2Y + 10 \)
2. \( X + Y = 25 \)

We can substitute \( X \) from the first equation into the second equation. First, solve the second equation for \( X \):
\[
X = 25 - Y
\]

Now substitute \( 25 - Y \) for \( X \) in the first equation:
\[
25 - Y = 2Y + 10
\]

Now solve for \( Y \):
\[
25 - Y = 2Y + 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
25 + 10 = 2Y + Y
\]
\[
35 = 3Y
\]
\[
Y = \frac{35}{3}
\]
\[
Y = 11.67
\]

Now substitute \( Y \) back into the equation for \( X \):
\[
X = 2(11.67) + 10
\]
\[
X = 23.33 + 10
\]
\[
X = 33.33
\]

Thus, you are currently \(\boxed{33}\) years old.

Let's denote your current age as \( y \) and your brother's current age as \( b \).

According to the problem:

1. In ten years, your age will be \( y + 10 \), and your brother's age will be \( b + 10 \). The term "twice" your brother's age means:
\[ y + 10 = 2(b + 10) \]

2. The sum of your ages in ten years will be 45:
\[ (y + 10) + (b + 10) = 45 \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

From the second equation:
\[ y + b + 20 = 45 \]
\[ y + b = 25 \]

From the first equation:
\[ y + 10 = 2(b + 10) \]
\[ y + 10 = 2b + 20 \]
\[ y = 2b + 10 \]

Now we have two equations with two variables:
1. \( y + b = 25 \)
2. \( y = 2b + 10 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[ (2b + 10) + b = 25 \]
\[ 3b + 10 = 25 \]
\[ 3b = 15 \]
\[ b = 5 \]

If your brother is 5 years old, you (yourself) are:
\[ y = 2b + 10 \]
\[ y = 2 \times 5 + 10 \]
\[ y = 10 + 10 \]
\[ y = 20 \]

So, you are 20 years old now.

Let's denote your current age as \( x \) years and your brother's current age as \( y \) years.

According to the given statement, in ten years, your age will be \( x + 10 \) years and your brother's age will be \( y + 10 \) years. We are told that in ten years, you will be twice your brother's age, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 10 = 2(y + 10) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 10 = 2y + 20 \]

Now, let's denote the current sum of your ages as \( S \), which is \( x + y \). According to the problem, the sum of your ages will be 45 years in ten years, so we can write:

\[ S + 10 = 45 \]

Solving this equation for \( S \):

\[ S = 45 - 10 \]
\[ S = 35 \]

Since \( S = x + y \), we have:

\[ x + y = 35 \]

Now, let's look at the equation we derived earlier:

\[ x + 10 = 2y + 20 \]

We can rearrange this to:

\[ x = 2y + 10 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( x + y = 35 \)
2. \( x = 2y + 10 \)

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

\[ 2y + 10 + y = 35 \]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[ 3y + 10 = 35 \]

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 3y = 25 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ y = \frac{25}{3} \]

Now, substitute \( y \) back into the first equation to find \( x \):

\[ x + \frac{25}{3} = 35 \]

Subtracting \( \frac{25}{3} \) from both sides:

\[ x = 35 - \frac{25}{3} \]

To subtract these, we need a common denominator:

\[ x = \frac{105}{3} - \frac{25}{3} \]
\[ x = \frac{80}{3} \]
\[ x = 26.6667 \]

So, you are currently \( \frac{80}{3} \) years old, which is approximately 26.67 years old.

Therefore, the answer is:

According to the first statement, in ten years, you will be twice your brother's age. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 10 = 2(y + 10) \]

According to the second statement, the sum of your ages will be 45 years in ten years:

\[ x + y = 45 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) \( x + 10 = 2(y + 10) \)
2) \( x + y = 45 \)

We can solve this system step by step. From the second equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 45 - x \]

Substitute this expression for \( y \) into the first equation:

\[ x + 10 = 2((45 - x) + 10) \]
\[ x + 10 = 2(55 - x) \]
\[ x + 10 = 110 - 2x \]
\[ 3x = 100 \]

So, you are currently \(\frac{100}{3}\) years old. When you are \(\frac{100}{3}\) years old, your brother will be \(\frac{115}{3}\) years old.

Let's verify:

- In ten years, your brother will be \(\frac{115}{3} + 10 = \frac{145}{3}\) years old.
- At that time, you will be \(\frac{100}{3} + 10 = \frac{130}{3}\) years old, and indeed, \(\frac{130}{3}\) is twice \(\frac{115}{3}\).

The solution satisfies both conditions, so the answer is \(\frac{100}{3}\) years old.

system
Let's denote your current age by \( x \) and your brother's current age by \( y \).

According to the first statement, in ten years, you will be twice your brother's age. This can be written as:
\[ x + 10 = 2(y + 10) \]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[ x + 10 = 2y + 20 \]
\[ x - 2y = 10 \] (Equation 1)

The second statement tells us that the sum of your ages will be 45 years old in ten years. This can be written as:
\[ (x + 10) + (y + 10) = 45 \]
\[ x + y + 20 = 45 \]
\[ x + y = 25 \] (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of linear equations with two variables:
\[ x - 2y = 10 \]
\[ x + y = 25 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (x + y) - (x - 2y) = 25 - 10 \]
\[ x + y - x + 2y = 15 \]
\[ 3y = 15 \]
\[ y = 5 \]

So, your brother is currently 5 years old. Now we can substitute \( y = 5 \) back into Equation 2:
\[ x + 5 = 25 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Therefore, you are currently 20 years old.
