###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

There are 5 houses on a street, and each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden. If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?

Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, so the total number of gnomes in these houses is \(4 \times 3 = 12\). Given that there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, the number of gnomes in the fifth house is \(20 - 12 = 8\).

Every house has 3 gnomes, so there are 4 * 3 = 12 gnomes on the first four houses. The total number of gnomes on the street is 20, so there are 20 - 12 = 8 gnomes on the fifth house.

Therefore, the answer is 8.

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the total number of gnomes on the street is 20. We know that the first four houses each have 3 gnomes. Let's calculate the total number of gnomes in these four houses:

First house: 3 gnomes
Second house: 3 gnomes
Third house: 3 gnomes
Fourth house: 3 gnomes

Adding these together:

3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 gnomes

Now, we know that the total number of gnomes on the street is 20. Therefore, the number of gnomes in the fifth house is:

20 (total gnomes) - 12 (gnomes in the first four houses) = 8 gnomes

So, the fifth house has 8 gnomes in the garden.

Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the total number of gnomes in the first four houses. Since each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, we can multiply 3 by 4 to get the total number of gnomes in those houses. Then, we subtract that number from the total number of gnomes on the street to find out how many gnomes the fifth house has.

Answer:
The fifth house has 16 gnomes.

To find the number of gnomes in the fifth house, let's start by determining the total number of gnomes in the first four houses. Since each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, we calculate:

\[ 3 \text{ gnomes/house} \times 4 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ gnomes} \]

We know the total number of gnomes on the street is 20. To find the number of gnomes in the fifth house, we subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes:

\[ 20 \text{ gnomes} - 12 \text{ gnomes} = 8 \text{ gnomes} \]

Therefore, the fifth house has 8 gnomes.

Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, so that's a total of \(4 \times 3 = 12\) gnomes.

The total number of gnomes on the street is 20, so the fifth house must have \(20 - 12 = 8\) gnomes.

Therefore, the fifth house has 8 gnomes.

To determine how many gnomes the fifth house has, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of gnomes on the street to find the number of gnomes in the fifth house.

Step 1: The first four houses each have 3 gnomes in the garden. Therefore, the total number of gnomes in the first four houses is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Step 2: The total number of gnomes on the street is 20. To find out how many gnomes the fifth house has, we subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, the fifth house has 8 gnomes in the garden.

To find out how many gnomes the fifth house has, we can start by adding the number of gnomes in the first four houses. Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, so we have:

\[ 3 \text{ gnomes/house} \times 4 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ gnomes} \]

This means the first four houses together have 12 gnomes. Since there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, we can subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes:

\[ 20 \text{ gnomes} - 12 \text{ gnomes} = 8 \text{ gnomes} \]

Let's break it down:

1) We know there are 5 houses on the street.
2) Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, so collectively, they have \(4 \times 3 = 12\) gnomes.
3) There are a total of 20 gnomes on the street.
4) To find the number of gnomes in the fifth house, we subtract the gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes: \(20 - 12 = 8\).
