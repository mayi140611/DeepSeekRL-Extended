To find out how many hours Melissa has to work, we first need to determine how many dresses she can make with her available fabric.

Given:
- Total fabric = 56 square meters
- Fabric required per dress = 4 square meters

First, we calculate the number of dresses she can make:
\[ \text{Number of dresses} = \frac{\text{Total fabric}}{\text{Fabric per dress}} \]
\[ \text{Number of dresses} = \frac{56 \text{ square meters}}{4 \text{ square meters per dress}} \]
\[ \text{Number of dresses} = 14 \]

Next, we know each dress takes 3 hours to make. So, to find out how many hours she needs to work, we multiply the number of dresses by the time required per dress:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Number of dresses} \times \text{Time per dress} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 14 \times 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 42 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Melissa has to work for 42 hours to make all the dresses.

First, we need to determine how many dresses Melissa can make with the fabric she has. We can do this by dividing the total amount of fabric by the amount needed for each dress:

\[
\text{Number of dresses} = \frac{\text{Total fabric}}{\text{Fabric per dress}} = \frac{56 \text{ square meters}}{4 \text{ square meters per dress}} = 14 \text{ dresses}
\]

Next, to find out how many hours Melissa has to work, we need to multiply the number of dresses by the time it takes to make each dress. Given that each dress takes 3 hours to make:

\[
\text{Total hours} = \text{Number of dresses} \times \text{Time per dress} = 14 \text{ dresses} \times 3 \text{ hours per dress} = 42 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Melissa has to work 42 hours.

First, we need to determine how many dresses Melissa can make with the fabric she has. Since each dress requires 4 square meters of fabric, and she has 56 square meters, the number of dresses she can make is:

\[ \text{Number of dresses} = \frac{56 \text{ square meters}}{4 \text{ square meters/dress}} = 14 \text{ dresses} \]

Next, we know that each dress takes 3 hours to make. Since she can make 14 dresses, the total number of hours she needs to work is:

\[ \text{Total hours} = 14 \text{ dresses} \times 3 \text{ hours/dress} = 42 \text{ hours} \]

So, in total, Melissa has to work for 42 hours.

Melissa has a total of 56 square meters of fabric. Each dress requires 4 square meters of fabric, so we can calculate the number of dresses she can make by dividing the total fabric by the fabric needed per dress: 56 / 4 = 14 dresses.

Now, we know each dress takes 3 hours to make, so to find out the total number of hours Melissa has to work, we multiply the number of dresses by the hours per dress: 14 dresses * 3 hours/dress = 42 hours.

Therefore, Melissa has to work 42 hours to make all 14 dresses.

Melissa has 56 square meters of fabric and each dress takes 4 square meters. So, the number of dresses she can make is 56 / 4 = 14 dresses. Each dress takes 3 hours to make, so the total number of hours she has to work is 14 * 3 = 42 hours.

However, since Melissa needs fabric before she can start making the dresses and it's not mentioned how much fabric she has initially, we can't determine the exact number of dresses she can make or the total hours she has worked until she runs out of fabric.

Therefore, we can only calculate the time if she has enough fabric to make the maximum possible dresses, but we can't determine the number of dresses she can make or the exact number of hours she has to work until she runs out of fabric.

First, let's determine how many dresses Melissa can make with the 56 square meters of fabric. Each dress requires 4 square meters of fabric, so we divide the total fabric by the amount needed per dress:

\[ \text{Number of dresses} = \frac{\text{Total fabric}}{\text{Fabric per dress}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

Now that we know Melissa can make 14 dresses, we need to figure out how many hours she will need to work to make all the dresses. We know that it takes 3 hours to make each dress. Therefore, for 14 dresses:

\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Number of dresses} \times \text{Hours per dress} = 14 \times 3 = 42 \]

So, Melissa has to work 42 hours.

To determine how many hours Melissa has to work, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dresses she can make with the available fabric.
2. Multiply that number by the number of hours it takes to make each dress.

First, we calculate the number of dresses Melissa can make:
Number of dresses = Total fabric / Fabric per dress
Number of dresses = 56 / 4
Number of dresses = 14

Next, we know that it takes 3 hours to make each dress. Therefore, the total number of hours Melissa has to work is:
Total hours = Number of dresses × Hours per dress
Total hours = 14 × 3
Total hours = 42

So, Melissa has to work 42 hours.

First, we need to determine how many dresses Melissa can make with 56 square meters of fabric. Each dress takes 4 square meters of fabric, so we divide the total square meters by the square meters per dress:
$$
\frac{56}{4} = 14
$$
So, Melissa can make 14 dresses. Now, we know that each dress takes 3 hours to make. Therefore, we multiply the number of dresses by the hours per dress to find the total hours required:
$$
14 \times 3 = 42

Thus, Melissa has to work 42 hours to make all the dresses.
