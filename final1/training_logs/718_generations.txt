To determine how many pages Coral must read in the third week, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pages in the book**: 600 pages.
  
2. **Pages read in the first week**: Coral reads half of the book in the first week. So, she reads \( \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) pages in the first week.
  
3. **Remaining pages after the first week**: 
   \[
   600 - 300 = 300 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. **Pages read in the second week**: Coral reads 30 percent of the remaining pages (300 pages). So, she reads \( 0.3 \times 300 = 90 \) pages in the second week.

5. **Remaining pages after the second week**: 
   \[
   300 - 90 = 210 \text{ pages}
   \]

6. **Pages read in the third week**: To finish the book, Coral must still read 210 pages.

Thus, Coral must read \( 210 \) pages in the third week to finish the book.

To determine how many pages Coral must read the third week, we need to calculate the number of pages she has already read and then find out how many pages are left.

First, Coral reads half of the book in the first week. Since the book is 600 pages long, she reads:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ pages} \]

After the first week, she has read 300 pages, so the remaining number of pages is:
\[ 600 - 300 = 300 \text{ pages} \]

Next, in the second week, she reads 30% of the remaining pages. The number of pages she reads in the second week is:
\[ 0.30 \times 300 = 90 \text{ pages} \]

After the second week, the remaining number of pages is:
\[ 300 - 90 = 210 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, Coral must read 210 pages the third week in order to finish the book.

Coral reads half of the book in the first week, so the number of pages she reads in the first week is \( \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) pages. After the first week, there are 600 - 300 = 300 pages remaining. In the second week, she reads 30% of the remaining pages, which is \( \frac{30}{100} \times 300 = 90 \) pages. After the second week, there are 300 - 90 = 210 pages remaining. So, in the third week, Coral must read 210 pages to finish the book.

First, let's calculate how many pages Coral reads in the first week. Since she reads half of the 600 pages in the first week, she reads \( \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) pages. This leaves \( 600 - 300 = 300 \) pages remaining.

In the second week, she reads 30% of the remaining pages. 30% of 300 pages is \( 0.30 \times 300 = 90 \) pages. So now she has \( 300 - 90 = 210 \) pages left.

To finish the book, she must read the remaining pages in the third week. Thus, Coral must read \( 210 \) pages in the third week to finish the book.

In the first week, Coral reads half of the book. So, she reads \( \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) pages. This means there are 600 - 300 = 300 pages remaining after the first week.

In the second week, she reads 30% of the remaining pages. 30% of 300 pages is \( 0.3 \times 300 = 90 \) pages. So, she reads 90 pages during the second week.

After two weeks, Coral has read 300 (first week) + 90 (second week) = 390 pages. She has 600 - 390 = 210 pages left to read.

To find out how many pages she must read the third week to finish the book, we subtract the number of pages read in the first two weeks from the total pages of the book: \( 600 - 390 = 210 \) pages.

Therefore, Coral must read 210 pages the third week.

To determine how many pages Coral needs to read in the third week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the pages read in the first week.
2. Determine the remaining pages after the first week.
3. Calculate the pages read in the second week.
4. Determine the remaining pages after the second week.
5. Calculate the number of pages needed to read in the third week.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Coral reads half of the book in the first week. Since the book is 600 pages long, the number of pages read in the first week is:
   \[
   \frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. The remaining pages after the first week is:
   \[
   600 - 300 = 300 \text{ pages}
   \]

3. In the second week, Coral reads 30% of the remaining pages. The number of pages read in the second week is:
   \[
   300 \times 0.30 = 90 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. The remaining pages after the second week is:
   \[
   300 - 90 = 210 \text{ pages}
   \]

5. To finish the book in the third week, Coral needs to read the remaining 210 pages.

So, Coral must read 210 pages in the third week to finish the book.

Coral starts with a book of 600 pages.

In the first week, she reads half of the book. Half of 600 pages is 300 pages.

So, after the first week, she has 600 - 300 = 300 pages left.

In the second week, she reads 30 percent of the remaining 300 pages. Thirty percent of 300 pages is 90 pages.

So, after the second week, she has 300 - 90 = 210 pages left.

The third week, therefore, she must read the remaining 210 pages to finish the book.

First, we need to determine how many pages Coral read in the first week. Since she reads half of the book in the first week, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pages read in the first week} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ pages}
\]

Next, we find out how many pages are left after she reads half of the book in the first week:

\[
\text{Pages remaining} = 600 - 300 = 300 \text{ pages}
\]

In the second week, Coral reads 30 percent of the remaining pages. To find out how many pages she reads in the second week, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pages read in the second week} = (0.30 \times 300) = 90 \text{ pages}
\]

Finally, we need to determine how many pages are left for Coral to read in the third week to finish the book. This is calculated as:

\[
\text{Pages left} = 300 - 90 = 210 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, the number of pages Coral must read in the third week to finish the book is:

\[

To determine how many pages Coral must read in the third week to finish the book, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pages read in the first week:**
   - The book is 600 pages long.
   - Coral reads half of it in the first week.
   - Pages read in the first week = \( \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) pages.

2. **Calculate the number of pages remaining after the first week:**
   - Total pages = 600.
   - Pages read in the first week = 300.
   - Pages remaining = 600 - 300 = 300 pages.

3. **Calculate how many pages Coral reads in the second week:**
   - Coral reads 30% of the remaining pages.
   - Pages read in the second week = \( 30\% \times 300 \).
   - \( 30\% \) of 300 is \( 0.3 \times 300 = 90 \) pages.

4. **Calculate the number of remaining pages after the second week:**
   - Pages remaining after the second week = 300 - 90 = 210 pages.

5. **Determine how many pages Coral must read in the third week to finish the book:**
   - Total pages in the book = 600 pages.
   - Pages remaining after the second week = 210 pages.
   - Pages to read in the third week = 600 - 210 = 390 pages.

Therefore, Coral must read 390 pages in the third week.
