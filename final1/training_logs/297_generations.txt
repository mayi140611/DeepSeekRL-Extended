To find out how many words are in each crossword puzzle on average, we need to first calculate the total number of words Bert reads in two weeks. Since it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil in two weeks, we can divide 1050 by 2 to get the average number of words per puzzle.

\[ \text{Average words per puzzle} = \frac{\text{Total words to use up a pencil}}{\text{Number of weeks}} \]

\[ \text{Average words per puzzle} = \frac{1050}{2} \]

\[ \text{Average words per puzzle} = 525 \]

So, there are on average 525 words in each crossword puzzle.

Given that Bert uses up a pencil every two weeks, and it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil, we need to find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle.

1. Calculate the total number of words Bert writes in two weeks:
   \[
   1050 \text{ words}
   \]

2. Since this number is the total for two weeks, we need to find the average number of words per day:
   \[
   \text{Total words in two weeks} = 1050 \text{ words}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days in two weeks} = 14 \text{ days}
   \]

3. Divide the total number of words by the number of days to find the average number of words per day:
   \[
   \text{Average words per day} = \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ days}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average words per day} = 75 \text{ words}
   \]

4. Since there are 5 crosswords puzzles in a week:
   \[
   \text{Average words per crossword puzzle} = \frac{75 \text{ words}}{5 \text{ puzzles}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average words per crossword puzzle} = 15 \text{ words}
   \]

To find out the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we can use the given information:

Total number of words used per pencil = 1050 words
Length of time between refilling the pencil = 2 weeks

We need to find the average number of words per puzzle in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of words by the number of days:

Average words per puzzle = Total words / (Number of days in a week) 
= 1050 words / 7 days
= 150 words per puzzle

So, each crossword puzzle on average has 150 words.

To find out the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we need to know how many puzzle days are there in two weeks.

Since there are 7 days in a week, two weeks have 14 days.

So, on average, there are 14 crossword puzzle days every two weeks. Given that Bert uses up one pencil after 1050 words, we can calculate the average number of words in each puzzle as follows:

\[ \text{Average words per puzzle} = \frac{\text{Total words used}}{\text{Number of puzzle days}} \]

\[ \text{Average words per puzzle} = \frac{1050}{14} \]

\[ \text{Average words per puzzle} = 75 \]

Therefore, each crossword puzzle has an average of 75 words.

To find out how many words are in each crossword puzzle on average, we need to divide the total number of words used by the average number of puzzles filled out each day.

Total words used in two weeks: 1050

Bert fills out one pencil every 14 days (since pencils last two weeks).

So, the number of words per puzzle = Total words used / (Number of puzzles per day * Number of days)

Number of words per puzzle = 1050 words / (1 pencil / 14 days * 14 days)

Therefore, BERT uses 7 words in each crossword puzzle on average.

To find out how many words are in each crossword puzzle on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of crossword puzzles Bert fills out in two weeks. Since there are 14 days in two weeks, and Bert fills out one crossword puzzle each day, he fills out 14 puzzles in two weeks.
2. We know that it takes 1050 words to use up a pencil, and Bert uses a pencil every two weeks. Therefore, the number of word-puzzles Bert completes in two weeks is 1050 words.
3. To find the average number of words per crossword puzzle, we divide the total number of words by the number of puzzles:
   \[
   \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ puzzles}} = 75 \text{ words per puzzle}
   \]

Therefore, each crossword puzzle on average contains 75 words.

To find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we first need to determine how many crossword puzzles Bert completes in two weeks.

Since Bert uses a pencil every two weeks, and it takes him an average of 1050 words to use up a pencil, we can divide the total number of words by the number of two-week periods:

1050 words / 2 = 525 words per two-week period

Now that we know Bert completes 525 words per two-week period, we can find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle by dividing the total number of words by the number of puzzles:

525 words / (525 puzzles / 2 puzzles per day) = 525 words / 2.5 puzzles = 210 words per crossword puzzle

Therefore, each crossword puzzle on average has 210 words.

system
To find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we start by understanding the relationship between the number of words used and the frequency with which the pencil is used up. Bert uses up a pencil every two weeks, which means he fills out 2 puzzles per two weeks. Given that he uses up 1050 words on average, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of words per puzzle} \times \text{Number of puzzles per two weeks} = 1050 \]

From the problem, we know that he uses up a pencil in two weeks by solving 2 puzzles. Let's denote the number of words in each crossword puzzle by \( w \). The total number of words used in two weeks can be written as:

\[ 2 \times w = 1050 \]

To find the value of \( w \), we solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ w = \frac{1050}{2} = 525 \]

Therefore, the average number of words in each crossword puzzle is 525.

First, we need to determine how many days Bert uses up a pencil in two weeks. Since he uses a pencil every two weeks, we need to know how many days are in two weeks. Typically, a week has 7 days, so two weeks is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.

Next, we know that Bert uses up a pencil after filling out the crossword puzzles for 14 days on average. Given that it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil, we need to divide the total number of words by the number of days to find the average number of words per day, and then by the number of days he uses the pencil to find the average number of words per crossword puzzle.

So we calculate:
\[ \text{Average number of words per crossword puzzle} = \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ days}} \]

\[ 1050 \div 14 = 75 \]

Therefore, each crossword puzzle averages 75 words on average.

To find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we start by determining the number of words Bert completes in two weeks. Since it takes Bert 1050 words to use up a pencil and he does this every two weeks, we can calculate the total number of words he completes in two weeks by dividing the total number of words by the number of pencil uses:

\[ \text{Total words} / \text{Pencil uses} = 1050 / 1 = 1050 \text{ words} \]

Since this total is for two weeks, we need to find out how many words are completed each day. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks there are 14 days. We can then divide the total number of words by the number of days to find the number of words completed each day:

\[ \text{Total words} / \text{Days} = 1050 / 14 = 75 \text{ words/day} \]

Now, we know that Bert completes 75 words each day. To find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we recognize that the crossword puzzles are daily and not weekly, so each puzzle is made up of 75 words. Therefore, each crossword puzzle on average has 75 words.

To find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we need to consider that Bert uses a pencil every two weeks. 

1. First, convert two weeks into days to make it easier to calculate. There are 14 days in two weeks.

2. If it takes Bert 1050 words to use up a pencil, and he uses it every two weeks, we find the number of words used per day by dividing the total number of words by the number of days:

   - Daily word count = total words / number of days
   - Daily word count = 1050 words / 14 days
   - Daily word count = 75 words per day

3. Since Bert fills out one crossword puzzle daily, the average number of words in each crossword puzzle is:

   - Average words per puzzle = daily word count
   - Average words per puzzle = 75 words
