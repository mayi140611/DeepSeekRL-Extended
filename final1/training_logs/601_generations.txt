To determine how much money each writer will earn from fourth place onwards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money that will be awarded to the top four places.
2. Subtract this amount from the total prize money ($800) to find the remaining amount to be distributed among the remaining 14 writers (since there are 18 novels in total, and 1-4 are the top 4 places).
3. Divide the remaining amount by 14 to find out how much each of the remaining 14 writers will earn.

First place: $200
Second place: $150
Third place: $120

Total for first three places:
\[ 200 + 150 + 120 = 470 \]

Total prize money: $800

Remaining prize money for the rest of the novels:
\[ 800 - 470 = 330 \]

Number of writers to distribute this money to: 18 - 4 = 14

Amount each writer gets from fourth place onwards:
\[ \frac{330}{14} = 23.5714... \]

Rounding to two decimal places, each writer will earn approximately:
\[ 23.57 \]

To determine how much money each writer earns from fourth place onwards, we first need to calculate the total prize money from the first three places.

First place: $200
Second place: $150

Total prize money for first three places:
\[ 200 + 150 + 120 = 470 \]

The remaining prize money for the rest of the novels is:
\[ 800 - 470 = 330 \]

Since there are 15 novels left to be awarded (18 total - 3 winners), the money for each of these novels is:

First, we need to determine how much money will go to the first three places. The total prize money is $800. The amounts for first place, second place, and third place are $200, $150, and $120 respectively.

Total for first three places: 
\[ 200 + 150 + 120 = 470 \]

Next, we subtract the sum of the first three places from the total prize money to find out how much is left for the remaining places, which are fourth place onwards:
\[ 800 - 470 = 330 \]

There are 15 remaining places (18 - 3 = 15) and each place will get the same amount of money. Therefore, the amount of money each writer will earn from fourth place onwards is:
\[ \frac{330}{15} = 22 \]

Thus, each writer from fourth place onwards will earn $22.

To determine how much money each writer will earn from fourth place onwards, we first need to calculate the total prize money for the first three places.

The total prize money for the first three places is calculated as follows:
First place: $200
Second place: $150
Third place: $120

Total prize money for the first three places: 
$$ 200 + 150 + 120 = 470 $$

The total prize money for all 18 novels is $800. Therefore, the prize money for the remaining novels (4th, 5th, and onwards) is:
$$ 800 - 470 = 330 $$

These 15 novels will split the $330 equally among them. Thus, the prize money for each writer from fourth place onwards is:
$$ \frac{330}{15} = 22 $$

So, writers from fourth place onwards will earn $22 each.

Reasoning:
To find out how much each writer earns from fourth place onwards, we first need to calculate the total amount of money allocated for the first three prizes.

1. First place prize = $200
2. Second place prize = $150
3. Third place prize = $120

Total for the first three prizes = $200 + $150 + $120 = $470

Now, the remaining amount to be distributed is the total prize money minus the total for the first three prizes, which is $800 - $470 = $330.

Finally, this remaining amount is to be split evenly among the rest of the 15 positions starting from fourth place.

Calculating the total earnings per writer from fourth to fifteenth place:
Earnings per writer = $330 / 15 = $22

Therefore, each writer from the fourth position onwards will earn $22.

To determine how much each writer will earn from fourth place onwards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money awarded to the top three places.
2. Subtract this amount from the total prize money to find the remaining amount for the bottom three places.
3. Divide the remaining amount by 3 to find out how much each writer will earn from fourth place onwards.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The total prize money is $800.
2. First place gets $200, second place gets $150, and third place gets $120. So the total for the top three places is:
   \[
   200 + 150 + 120 = 470
   \]
3. Subtract the total for the top three places from the total prize money to find the remaining amount:
   \[
   800 - 470 = 330
   \]
4. Divide the remaining amount by 3 to find out how much each writer will earn from fourth place onwards:
   \[
   \frac{330}{3} = 110
   \]

Therefore, each writer from fourth place onwards will earn $110.

To find out how much each writer will earn from fourth place onwards, we need to first determine how much money is left after awarding the first three places.

The total prize money is $800.
First place: $200
Second place: $150
Third place: $120

Adding these up: $200 + $150 + $120 = $470

Now, subtract this from the total prize money:

$800 - $470 = $330

This $330 will be divided among the remaining 15 novels (since first, second, and third places have already been awarded, leaving 18 - 3 = 15).

Dividing this by 15 gives us the amount each writer will get from fourth place onwards:

$330 รท 15 = $22

So, each writer from fourth place onwards will earn $22.

To determine how much money each writer from fourth place onwards will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money given out to the first three places first.

1. First place: $200
2. Second place: $150
3. Third place: $120

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 200 + 150 + 120 = 470 \]

The total prize money for the first three places is $470. The total prize money for all 18 novels is $800. Therefore, the remaining amount of money for the remaining 15 novels is:
\[ 800 - 470 = 330 \]

Each of the remaining 15 novels will receive an equal share of the $330. Thus, the prize money for each of the remaining 15 novels is:
\[ \frac{330}{15} = 22 \]

So, each writer from fourth place onwards will earn $22.

To find out how much money each writer earns from fourth place onwards, we first need to determine how much money is left after awarding first, second, and third place prizes. The total prize money is $800, and the sum of the first three places is $200 + $150 + $120 = $470. 

The remaining money is $800 - $470 = $330. 

There are 18 novels with a total prize of $330. To find out how much each writer earns from fourth place onwards, we divide the remaining prize money by the number of novels after the top three. 

$330 / 16 = $20.625

However, this would result in a total prize for 16 novels, far exceeding the 18 novels as specified. Let's correct the distribution and figure out the actual awarding process:

1st place: $200
2nd place: $150
3rd place: $120

Total for first 3 places: $200 + $150 + $120 = $470

$800 - $470 = $330 is the total left.

Since we are distributing the remaining $330 among the rest of the novels starting from 4th place:

$330 / 16 = $20.625

However, this still doesn't fit the scenario as there are 18 novels in total, and the calculations should reflect the total prize money distribution correctly.

The correct calculation should be:

Total money: $800
First three places: $470
Total remaining for fourth place to the end: $800 - $470 = $330

The correct way to divide the remaining 15 novels' prize (after giving 200 to first place, 150 to second place, 120 to third place, and 20.625 to fourth place, we need to round it to the nearest whole number to fit the 16 novels, which is $20 per novel to ensure the total still adds up):

$20.625 rounds to $20 (assuming rounding rules, we'll round towards the nearest whole number for simplicity in interpretation, but for mathematical integrity, it's more precise to have exact division without rounding).

So, each writer from fourth place onwards will earn:

$20.

In the publishing contest, the total prize money is $800, which includes prizes for 18 novels.
First place gets $200, second place gets $150, and third place gets $120.
First place, second place, and third place together have won $200 + $150 + $120 = $470.
Therefore, the remaining prize money is $800 - $470 = $330.
Since there are 18 novels, the prize money for the rest of the awards is $330 / 18 = $18.33 each.

1. Calculate the total amount awarded to the first three places.
2. Subtract this amount from the total prize money to find the remaining prize money.
3. Divide the remaining prize money by the number of places (18) to find how much each writer will earn from fourth place onwards.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount awarded to the first three places.
- First place: $200
- Second place: $150
- Third place: $120

Total for first three places = $200 + $150 + $120 = $470

Step 2: Subtract the total amount awarded to the first three places from the total prize money to find the remaining prize money.
Total prize money = $800
Remaining prize money = $800 - $470 = $330

Step 3: Divide the remaining prize money by the number of places to find how much each writer will earn from fourth place onwards.
Number of remaining places = 18 - 3 = 15

Amount per writer (from fourth place onwards) = Remaining prize money / Number of remaining places
= $330 / 15

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total prize money and then divide it among the 18 winners. The given prize amounts for the first three places are $200, $150, and $120. Adding these amounts together gives us the total prize money allocated for these three places:

First place: $200
Second place: $150
Third place: $120

Total for the first three places: $200 + $150 + $120 = $470

The total prize money for all 18 novels is $800. Therefore, the remaining prize money for the rest of the novels is:

Total prize money minus the prize money for the first three places: $800 - $470 = $330

Since there are 18 novels in total, the remaining prize money of $330 will be divided among the remaining 15 novels (18 - 3 winning novels).

To find out how much money each writer will earn from fourth place onwards, we divide the remaining prize money by the number of remaining winners:

$330 / 15 novels = $22 per writer
