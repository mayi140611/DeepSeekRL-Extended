#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote Jayden's current age as \( x \). According to the problem, in 3 years, Jayden's age will be \( x + 3 \) and this will be half of Ernesto's age in 3 years. Ernesto's current age is given as 11 years. Therefore, in 3 years, Ernesto's age will be \( 11 + 3 = 14 \) years. So we can write the equation:

\[ x + 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \]

We solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 3 = 7 \]
\[ x = 7 - 3 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Jayden is currently 4 years old.

Let \( J \) represent Jayden's current age.
Given that in 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age.
Ernesto is 11 years old.

We write the equation as follows:
\[ J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} (11 + 3) \]

Solving this:
\[ J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \]
\[ J + 3 = 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Jayden is currently 4 years old.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####


system
Currently, Ernesto is 11 years old.

3 years from now, Ernesto will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

At that time, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age, which is 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Jayden's current age, we subtract the 3 years that will pass:

Jayden's current age = 7 years (Jayden's age in 3 years) - 3 years (time from now) = 4 years.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote Jayden's current age as \( J \) and Ernesto's current age as \( E \). According to the problem, Ernesto is 11 years old, so \( E = 11 \).

In 3 years, Jayden's age will be \( J + 3 \) and Ernesto's age will be \( E + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \).

The problem states that in 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \]

Let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J + 3 = 7 \]
\[ J = 7 - 3 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jayden is currently 4 years old.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####


system
To find Jayden's current age, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote Jayden's current age as \(J\).

According to the problem, in 3 years, Jayden's age will be half of Ernesto's age. Ernesto's age is given as 11 years. Therefore, in 3 years, Ernesto's age will be \(11 + 3 = 14\) years.

In 3 years, Jayden's age will be \(J + 3\). According to the problem, this will be half of Ernesto's age when Jayden has 3 years less to reach the specified age. Thus, we can write the equation:

\[J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times (11 + 3)\]
\[J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\]
\[J + 3 = 7\]

Now, we solve for \(J\):

\[J = 7 - 3\]
\[J = 4\]

Therefore, Jayden is currently 4 years old.

system
Let \( J \) represent Jayden's current age and \( E \) represent Ernesto's current age. We are given that Ernesto is 11 years old:
\[
E = 11
\]

In 3 years, Jayden's age will be \( J + 3 \) and Ernesto's age will be \( E + 3 \):
\[
E + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14
\]

According to the problem, in 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times (14)
\]

Solving for \( J \):
\[
J + 3 = 7
\]
\[
J = 7 - 3
\]
\[
J = 4

Thus, Jayden is currently \( \boxed{4} \) years old.

Let's denote Jayden's current age as \( J \) and Ernesto's current age as \( E \).

Given:
- \( E = 11 \) (Ernesto is 11 years old).
- In 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age.

First, express Ernesto's age in 3 years:
\[ E_{\text{3 years}} = E + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

According to the problem, in 3 years, Jayden's age will be half of Ernesto's age at that time:
\[ J + 3 = \frac{E_{\text{3 years}}}{2} \]

Substitute the value of \( E_{\text{3 years}} \):
\[ J + 3 = \frac{14}{2} \]
\[ J + 3 = 7 \]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 7 - 3 \]

Let's denote Jayden's current age as \( J \) and Ernesto's current age as \( E \). We are given that Ernesto is currently 11 years old, so \( E = 11 \).

According to the problem, in 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} (E + 3) \]

Substituting \( E = 11 \) into the equation, we get:

#### GENERATION 12 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's break down the information given:
- In 3 years, Jayden's age will be half of Ernesto's age.
- Ernesto is currently 11 years old.

To find Jayden's age now, we need to calculate Ernesto's age in 3 years and then find half of that.

Ernesto's age in 3 years = current age + 3
= 11 + 3
= 14

Jayden's age in 3 years will be half of Ernesto's age in 3 years:
= (Ernesto's age in 3 years) / 2
= 14 / 2
= 7

So, Jayden's age now will be 7 years less than his age in 3 years.

Jayden's current age = Jayden's age in 3 years - 3
= 7 - 3
= 4

Therefore, Jayden is currently 4 years old.

system
Let's start by setting up the relationship between Jayden's age and Ernesto's age based on the information given.
We'll denote Jayden's current age as \( J \).
According to the problem:
- In 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age.
- Ernesto is currently 11 years old.

We can express this relationship algebraically. Let's denote Jayden's current age \( J \) and Ernesto's current age 11. In 3 years, Ernesto's age will be \( 11 + 3 \). The problem states that at that time, Jayden's age will be half this number. Thus we can write the equation:
\[ J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} (11 + 3) \]

Next, we solve for \( J \).
First, simplify the right-hand side:
\[ J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \]
\[ J + 3 = 7 \]

Then, isolate \( J \) by subtracting 3 from both sides:
\[ J = 7 - 3 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jayden is currently 4 years old.

#### GENERATION 14 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote Jayden's current age as \( J \). According to the problem, in 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age. Ernesto is currently 11 years old, so in 3 years, he will be \( 11 + 3 = 14 \) years old. This means that in 3 years, Jayden will be \( J + 3 \) years old, and this will be half of 14. So we can set up the equation:

\[ J + 3 = \frac{14}{2} \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ J + 3 = 7 \]

Subtracting 3 from both sides to solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 7 - 3 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jayden is currently 4 years old.

Let's denote Jayden's current age as J and Ernesto's current age as E.

According to the problem, in 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age. So, we can write the equation:

J + 3 = 1/2(E + 3)

Given that E (Ernesto's current age) is 11 years, we can substitute this value into the equation:

J + 3 = 1/2(11 + 3)

J + 3 = 1/2(14)

J + 3 = 7

J = 7 - 3
J = 4
