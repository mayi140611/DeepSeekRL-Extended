###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

One of Robi's new year's resolutions is to start saving. He started to save $2 in January. This is followed by $4 in February and $8 in March. If he continues this saving pattern, how much will be his total savings after 6 months?

system
Robi's savings form a geometric sequence where the first term \( a = 2 \) and the common ratio \( r = 2 \).

The sum of the first 6 terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \]

Plugging in \( a = 2 \), \( r = 2 \), and \( n = 6 \):
\[ S_6 = 2 \frac{1-2^6}{1-2} = 2 \frac{1-64}{-1} = 2 \times 63 = 126 \]

Therefore, after 6 months, Robi's total savings will be $126.

system
Robi's savings pattern can be described by a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term. The amount saved in January is $2, in February is $4, and in March is $8. 

To find the total savings after 6 months, we calculate the sum of the first 6 terms of this geometric sequence:
- First term \(a_1 = 2\)
- Common ratio \(r = 2\)
- Number of terms \(n = 6\)

The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = a_1 \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ S_6 = 2 \frac{1-2^6}{1-2} \]
\[ S_6 = 2 \frac{1-64}{-1} \]
\[ S_6 = 2 \times 63 \]
\[ S_6 = 126 \]

So, Robi's total savings after 6 months will be $126.

Robi starts with $2 in January, $4 in February, and $8 in March. Each month, the amount saved doubles from the previous month.

To find his total savings after 6 months:
1. Total savings after 1 month = $2 (January) + $4 (February) + $8 (March) = $14
2. Total savings after 2 months = $14 (total from 1 month) + $8 (February) + $16 (March)
   = $14 + $8 + $16 = $38
3. Total savings after 3 months = $38 (total from 2 months) + $16 (March) + $32 (April)
   = $38 + $16 + $32 = $86
4. Total savings after 4 months = $86 (total from 3 months) + $32 (April) + $64 (May)
   = $86 + $32 + $64 = $182
5. Total savings after 5 months = $182 (total from 4 months) + $64 (May) + $128 (June)
   = $182 + $64 + $128 = $374
6. Total savings after 6 months = $374 (total from 5 months) + $128 (June)
   = $374 + $128 = $502

Robi's savings form a geometric progression where the first term \(a = 2\) and the common ratio \(r = 2\).

The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Here, \(n = 6\), \(a = 2\), and \(r = 2\).

Substituting these values into the formula we get:
\[ S_6 = 2 \frac{1 - 2^6}{1 - 2} \]
\[ S_6 = 2 \frac{1 - 64}{-1} \]
\[ S_6 = 2 \frac{-63}{-1} \]
\[ S_6 = 2 \times 63 \]
\[ S_6 = 126 \]

Therefore, Robi's total savings after 6 months will be $126.

In January, Robi saved $2. 
In February, he saved $4, which is double the amount of January.
In March, he saved $8, which is double the amount of February.
Following this pattern, we see that the amount of savings doubles each month.

We can use a formula for the sum of a geometric series to calculate the total savings after 6 months: 
S = (a(1-r^n)/1-r)
Where a is the first term in the sequence; r is the common ratio between terms; n is the number of terms in the sequence being summed.

For Robi's Savings:
a = 2
n = 6
r = 2 (double each month)

Plugging these values into the formula:

S = (2(1-2^6)/(1-2) = -62
Because we're summing a negative amount, our net savings after 6 months will be -62.

Therefore, Robi's net savings after 6 months will be -$62.

The saving pattern is as follows:

- January: $2
- February: $4 = $2 * 2
- March: $8 = $2 * 4

This pattern shows that the amount saved doubles each month.

To find the total savings after 6 months, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

\[ S = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Where,
- \( S \) is the sum of the series,
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( r \) is the common ratio,
- \( n \) is the number of terms.

Here, \( a = 2 \), \( r = 2 \), and \( n = 6 \).

Now, calculate the total savings:

\[ S = 2 \frac{1 - 2^6}{1 - 2} \]
\[ S = 2 \frac{1 - 64}{-1} \]
\[ S = 2 \frac{-63}{-1} \]
\[ S = 2 \times 63 \]

Robi's saving pattern doubles every month: $2 in January, $4 in February, and $8 in March. This doubling follows an exponential growth pattern. After 6 months, the amount saved can be calculated by summing each monthâ€™s saving. For each month \( m \) (starting from January): \( a_m = 2 \cdot (2^{m-1}) \). The total savings after 6 months will be the sum of the savings for each month from January to June. 

<answer>
The total savings after 6 months is calculated by summing the amount saved each month, which follows the pattern of 2^(n-1) dollars, starting from January. Each month, the amount saved multiplies the previous month's by 2. Summing these up with an appropriate formula, a total of $126.

The pattern of savings follows a geometric progression where each term is twice the previous one. The amounts saved each month form the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

To find the total savings after 6 months, we can sum these amounts:
2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 126

Now, let's reason about the total amount saved after 6 months:
- January: $2
- February: $4
- March: $8
- April: $16
- May: $32
- June: $64

We can see that after each month, the subsequent month's savings is simply double the previous month's savings. So, the total savings after 6 months can be calculated by summing up all these amounts, which is the sum of a geometric sequence.

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:
a = the first term ($2)
r = the common ratio (2, since each month's savings is double the previous month's)
n = the number of terms (6 months)

Plugging in the values:

S = 2 * (1 - 2^6) / (1 - 2)

S = 2 * (1 - 64) / (-1)

S = 2 * (-63) / (-1)

S = -126 / -1

S = 126

Therefore, the total savings after 6 months will be $126.

Now, we can conclude:

<reasoning>
The pattern of savings follows a geometric progression where each term is double the previous one. The sums of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Robi's savings form a geometric sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 2\) and the common ratio \(r = 2\). The terms of the sequence are \(2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\).
