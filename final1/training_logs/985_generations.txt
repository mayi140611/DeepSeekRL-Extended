<reasoning>
To calculate Grace's earnings for September, we need to multiply the number of hours spent on each task by the respective hourly rate and then add up all the earnings.

For mowing lawns:
\(6 \, \text{hours} \times $6 \, \text{per hour} = $36\)

For pulling weeds:
\(9 \, \text{hours} \times $11 \, \text{per hour} = $99\)

For putting down mulch:
\(10 \, \text{hours} \times $9 \, \text{per hour} = $90\)

Now, we add up all the earnings:
\(Total \, Earnings = $36 + $99 + $90 = $225\).

So, Grace earned $225 in September.

Grace's earnings can be calculated by adding up the earnings from each service she provided in September. 

For mowing lawns, her earnings are $6 per hour times 63 hours.
For pulling weeds, her earnings are $11 per hour times 9 hours.
For putting down mulch, her earnings are $9 per hour times 10 hours.

Calculating each:
- Earnings from mowing lawns: \(6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 63 \text{ hours} = 378 \text{ dollars}\)
- Earnings from pulling weeds: \(11 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 99 \text{ dollars}\)
- Earnings from putting down mulch: \(9 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}\)

Now, we sum up all of these earnings to find the total amount:
\(378 \text{ dollars} + 99 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 567 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, Grace earned $567 in September.

   - Hours worked = 9
   - Earnings from pulling weeds = 9 hours * $11/hour = $99

3. Putting down mulch:
   - Rate per task = $9
   - Hours worked = 10
   - Earnings from putting down mulch = 10 hours * $9/hour = $90

To calculate the total money Grace earned in September, we need to calculate earnings from each service and then add them together.

For mowing lawns, Grace charges $6 per hour. She worked 63 hours, so her earnings from mowing lawns are:
\[ 63 \text{ hours} \times $6/\text{hour} = $378 \]

For pulling weeds, she charges $11 per session. She pulled weeds for 9 hours, so her earnings from pulling weeds are:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times $11/\text{hour} = $99 \]

For putting down mulch, she charges $9 per session. She put down mulch for 10 hours, so her earnings from putting down mulch are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} \times $9/\text{hour} = $90 \]

Now, we add up all these earnings to get Grace's total earnings for September:
