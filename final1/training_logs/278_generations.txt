The total area of the property is the sum of the house and the barn. So, 2,400 sq ft + 1,000 sq ft = 3,400 sq ft. 
The price per square foot is $98, so the total price of the property is 3,400 sq ft * $98 sq ft = $333,200.

The price of the house is $98 per square foot, so the house itself is priced at 98 * 2,400 = $235,200.
The barn is priced at $98 * 1,000 = $98,000.
The total price of the property is 235,200 + 98,000 = $333,200.

The price of the house is $98 per square foot, and the house is 2,400 sq ft, so the cost of the house is $98 * 2,400 = $235,200.
The barn out back is 1,000 sq ft, so the cost of the barn is $98 * 1,000 = $98,000.
The total cost of the property is the sum of the cost of the house and the barn, which is $235,200 + $98,000 = $333,200.

To find the total price of the property, we first need to calculate the price of the house. The house is 2,400 square feet and its price is $98 per square foot.

Price of the house = Area of the house × Price per square foot
Price of the house = 2,400 sq ft × $98/sq ft
Price of the house = $235,200

Now, we'll add the price of the barn to the price of the house to find the total price of the property.

Price of the barn = Area of the barn × Price per square foot
Price of the barn = 1,000 sq ft × $98/sq ft
Price of the barn = $98,000

Total price of the property = Price of the house + Price of the barn
Total price of the property = $235,200 + $98,000
Total price of the property = $333,200

The price of the house is $98 per square foot, and the house is 2,400 square feet. So the cost of the house is 2,400 sq ft * $98/sq ft = $235,200.

The barn is 1,000 square feet, so the cost of the barn is 1,000 sq ft * $98/sq ft = $98,000.

The total cost of the property is the sum of the cost of the house and the barn, which is $235,200 + $98,000 = $333,200.

To find the total price of the property, we first need to calculate the price of the house and the barn separately.

The price of the house is given as $98 per square foot. Since the house is 2,400 square feet, we can calculate the total price of the house by multiplying the price per square foot by the total square footage:

Price of the house = Price per sq ft × Total square footage of the house
Price of the house = $98 × 2,400 sq ft
Price of the house = $235,200

Next, we calculate the price of the barn. The barn is 1,000 square feet, so:

Price of the barn = Price per sq ft × Total square footage of the barn
Price of the barn = $98 × 1,000 sq ft
Price of the barn = $98,000

Now, to find the total price of the property, we add the price of the house and the barn:

Total price = Price of the house + Price of the barn
Total price = $235,200 + $98,000
Total price = $333,200

Therefore, the total price of the property is $333,200.

To find the total price of the property, we first need to calculate the total square footage of the house and the barn. 

The house is 2,400 sq ft and the barn is 1,000 sq ft. 

Adding these two values together, we get:

2,400 sq ft + 1,000 sq ft = 3,400 sq ft

Now that we know the total square footage, we can calculate the total price by multiplying this by the price per square foot.

Price per square foot = $98
Total square footage = 3,400 sq ft

Total price = Price per sq ft * Total sq ft
Total price = $98 * 3,400
Total price = $333,200

Therefore, the total price of the property is $333,200.

To find the total price of the property, we need to calculate the price of the house and the barn separately, and then add them together.

1. Calculate the price of the house: 2,400 sq ft * $98/sq ft = $235,200.
2. Calculate the price of the barn: 1,000 sq ft * $98/sq ft = $98,000.

Now, add the prices of the house and the barn: $235,200 + $98,000 = $333,200.

The price of the house is $98/sq ft, and the house is 2,400 sq ft. Calculate the cost of the house:
Cost of the house = Price per sq ft * Square footage
                    = $98 * 2,400
                    = $235,200

The barn is 1,000 sq ft, so calculate the cost of the barn:
Cost of the barn = Price per sq ft * Square footage
                = $98 * 1,000
                = $98,000

The total price of the property is the sum of the cost of the house and the barn:
Total price = Cost of the house + Cost of the barn
           = $235,200 + $98,000
           = $333,200

The price of the house is $98 sq ft and it is 2,400 sq ft.
The price of the barn is $98 sq ft and it is 1,000 sq ft.

Total price of the property = (price of house * area of house) + (price of barn * area of barn)

Total price = (98 * 2,400) + (98 * 1,000)

Total price = (235,200) + (98,000)
