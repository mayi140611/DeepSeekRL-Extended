###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Steve wanted to make a total of $100 within four days, so he took on a berry-picking job in Sweden. The job paid $2 for every pound of lingonberries picked. On Monday he picked 8 pounds. Tuesdayâ€™s harvest was triple what he had picked the previous day. On Wednesday he felt very tired and decided to rest. How many pounds of lingonberries did Steve have to pick on Thursday?

To find out how many pounds of lingonberries Steve had to pick on Thursday, we first need to calculate the total amount of lingonberries he picked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Steve picked 8 pounds of lingonberries.
On Tuesday, his pick was triple that of Monday, so he picked \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) pounds of lingonberries.

The total amount picked by Tuesday is \( 8 + 24 = 32 \) pounds of lingonberries.

Steve wanted to make a total of $100, and he earns $2 per pound of lingonberries. To find the total amount he needs to pick to reach $100, we divide $100 by $2:

\[ 100 \div 2 = 50 \]

So, Steve needs to pick 50 pounds of lingonberries in total over the three days.

We already know he picked 32 pounds by Tuesday, so on Thursday, he needs to pick:

\[ 50 - 32 = 18 \]

Steve had to pick 18 pounds of lingonberries on Thursday.

To determine how many pounds of lingonberries Steve needs to pick on Thursday, we first calculate how much he has already earned and how much more he needs to reach his goal of $100.

1. **Calculate total earnings:**
   - Monday: 8 pounds * $2/pound = $16
   - Tuesday: 3 * 8 pounds = 24 pounds * $2/pound = $48
   - Wednesday: 0 pounds * $2/pound = $0
   - So far, Steve has earned $16 + $48 + $0 = $64
   - He needs $100 - $64 = $36 more

2. **Determine how many pounds he needs on Thursday:**
   - Since he earns $2 per pound, he needs $36 / $2/pound = 18 pounds

Therefore, Steve needs to pick 18 pounds of lingonberries on Thursday.

To determine how many pounds of lingonberries Steve needed to pick on Thursday, we need to calculate the total amount he earned and the amount he already picked on Monday and Tuesday.

1. **Calculate the total earnings:** Steve aims to earn $100 in four days. The job pays $2 for every pound of lingonberries picked. So, the total pounds of lingonberries he needs to pick to earn $100:
   \[
   \text{Total pounds needed} = \frac{\$100}{\$2/\text{pound}} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount picked on Monday and Tuesday:**
   - Monday: 8 pounds.
   - Tuesday: Triple the Monday's amount, so:
     \[
     \text{Tuesday's pounds} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total pounds picked on Monday and Tuesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total pounds on Monday and Tuesday} = 8 + 24 = 32 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine how many pounds Steve still needs to pick on Thursday:**
   \[
   \text{Pounds needed on Thursday} = 50 \text{ pounds} - 32 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Steve had to pick 18 pounds of lingonberries on Thursday.

On Monday, Steve picked 8 pounds of lingonberries.
On Tuesday, his harvest was triple what he had picked on Monday, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pounds.

By the end of Tuesday, he had picked a total of 8 + 24 = 32 pounds of lingonberries.

To reach his goal of $100, Stevie needs to earn $100 * $2 = $200 in total.

He has already picked 32 pounds, so he needs to pick an additional $200 - $200 = $0 total between Monday and the following day.

Since he feels tired on Wednesday, he decides to rest and makes zero pounds on Wednesday.

So Steve has already met his goal, and he has no more berries to pick on Thursday.

To determine how many pounds of lingonberries Steve needs to pick on Thursday, let's calculate the total amount he needs to pick by the end of Wednesday.

On Monday, Steve picked 8 pounds of lingonberries.
On Tuesday, his harvest was triple what he picked on Monday, so he picked \(3 \times 8 = 24\) pounds of lingonberries.
Therefore, by Tuesday, the total pounds harvested are \(8 + 24 = 32\) pounds.

By the end of Tuesday, Steve wants to have picked a total of $100 worth of lingonberries. Since the job pays $2 per pound, he needs to pick \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) pounds of lingonberries by the end of Wednesday to reach his goal of $100.

He has already harvested 32 pounds by Tuesday, so he needs to pick \(50 - 32 = 18\) pounds on Thursday to meet his goal.

To find out how many pounds of lingonberries Steve needs to pick on Thursday, we first need to calculate the total amount of lingonberries he picked on Monday and Tuesday combined.

On Monday, Steve picked 8 pounds of lingonberries.
On Tuesday, his harvest was triple the amount of Monday, which is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) pounds.

So, on Tuesday, Steve picked 24 pounds of lingonberries.

Now, we add the amounts picked on Monday and Tuesday together to find the total amount picked in those two days:
\[8 + 24 = 32\] pounds.

Since the job pays $2 for every pound of lingonberries picked, Steve's earnings for the first two days can be calculated as:
\[32 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pound} = 64 \text{ dollars}.\]

Steve wants to make a total of $100. Subtracting his earnings for the first two days from $100 to find out how much more he needs to earn on Thursday:
\[100 \text{ dollars} - 64 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars}.\]

Finally, to find out how many pounds of lingonberries Steve needs to pick on Thursday to earn the remaining $36:
\[36 \text{ dollars} \div 2 \text{ dollars/pound} = 18 \text{ pounds}.\]

Therefore, Steve needs to pick 18 pounds of lingonberries on Thursday.

To find out how many pounds of lingonberries Steve needed to pick on Thursday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Steve picked on Tuesday:**
   Tuesday's harvest was triple what he had picked on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's harvest} = 3 \times 8 \text{ pounds} = 24 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount Steve picked by Wednesday:**
   Now we add the Wednesday harvest (since there is no Wednesday harvest mentioned):
   \[
   \text{Total by Wednesday} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 24 \text{ pounds} = 32 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount Steve needed to reach $100:**
   He wanted $100 total.
   \[
   \text{Total pounds needed} = \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars per pound}} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many pounds Steve had picked by Thursday:**
   Subtract the total pounds collected by Wednesday (32 pounds) from the total pounds needed (50 pounds).
   \[
   \text{Pounds Steve needed on Thursday} = 50 \text{ pounds} - 32 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of hours Steve needs to work on Thursday:**
   Assume Steve can pick lingonberries at a constant rate such that 1 pound of lingonberries corresponds to 1 hour of work.
   \[
   \text{Hours needed on Thursday} = 18 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the pay rate for staying rested on Thursday:**
   Since the question does not provide a payment rate for not working, we will assume he gets paid $1 per hour of rest.
   \[
   \text{Pay for rest Thursday} = 18 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ dollar per hour} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Verify the total earnings:**
   He earns $2 for every pound of lingonberries picked.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings for Thursday} = 18 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars per pound} = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Adding the earnings from rest (18 dollars):
   \[
   \text{Total earnings including rest and picking} = 36 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 54 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Adding rest earnings to total budget:
   \[
   \text{Total budget} = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   This assumption that rest earns $1 per hour isn't correct as given.

8. **Reassess the hours and calculate a realistic scenario:**

Since the scenario has a mistake and total earnings in rest (which should be included or not included) isn't mentioned, we assume earnings or pay is not influenced by rest.

9. **Finally, the amount picked on Thursday is already calculated correctly.**
   The answer is 18 pounds.

Given the reasoning process above, it appears that the initial misinterpretation of earning by rest caused an incorrect conclusion in the original attempt.

Steve's total earnings goal is $100. The job pays $2 per pound of lingonberries.

On Monday, he picked 8 pounds. So, his earnings for Monday are 8 * $2 = $16.

On Tuesday, his harvest was triple that of Monday. Hence, his harvest for Tuesday is 3 * 8 = 24 pounds.

For the total on Wednesday, considering he rested, his earnings are $0.

To find out how many pounds Steve needs to pick on Thursday to reach his target of $100, we calculate the remaining earnings: $100 - ($16 + $0 + $0) = $100 - $16 = $84.

Since lingonberries sell at $2 per pound, the number of pounds Steve needs to pick on Thursday is $84 / $2 = 42 pounds.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. On Monday, Steve picked 8 pounds of lingonberries.
2. On Tuesday, he picked triple what he picked on Monday, so that's \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) pounds.
3. The total from Monday and Tuesday is \( 8 + 24 = 32 \) pounds.
4. He wants to earn a total of $100.
5. He earns $2 per pound, so for 32 pounds, he would make \( 32 \times 2 = $64 \).
6. He is $40 short to make $100.
7. On Wednesday, he rested, so he picked no additional pounds.
8. On Thursday, he needs to pick enough to make the remaining $40.

So on Thursday, Steve needs to pick \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) pounds of lingonberries.

To determine how many pounds of lingonberries Steve had to pick on Thursday, we need to first calculate the total amount of lingonberries he picked on Monday and Tuesday.

1. Steve picked 8 pounds on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, he picked triple the amount of Monday, which is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) pounds.

Next, we sum the pounds picked on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Steve's goal is to make a total of $100. Since he is paid $2 for every pound of lingonberries picked, the total pounds he needs to pick to make $100 can be calculated as:
\[ 100 \div 2 = 50 \text{ pounds} \]

To find out how many more pounds Steve needs to pick on Thursday, we subtract the pounds picked on Monday and Tuesday from the total pounds needed:
\[ 50 - 32 = 18 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Steve had to pick 18 pounds of lingonberries on Thursday.

To determine how many pounds of lingonberries Steve had to pick on Thursday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Steve has already earned on Monday and Tuesday.
2. Determine how much more he needs to earn by Wednesday to reach $100.
3. Calculate the remaining amount Steve needs to earn by Thursday to reach $100.

First, let's calculate the earnings for Monday and Tuesday:
- On Monday, Steve picked 8 pounds of lingonberries, earning \(8 \times 2 = 16\) dollars.
- On Tuesday, his harvest was triple the amount of Monday, so he picked \(3 \times 8 = 24\) pounds. He earned \(24 \times 2 = 48\) dollars.

Now, let's add these amounts to find out how much he needs to earn by Wednesday to reach $100:
- Total earnings from Monday and Tuesday: \(16 + 48 = 64\) dollars.
- Earnings needed by Wednesday: \(100 - 64 = 36\) dollars.

Since Steve picked 24 pounds of lingonberries on Tuesday, the remaining pounds he needs to pick on Wednesday is:
- Remaining pounds to pick on Wednesday: \(36 - 24 = 12\) pounds.

Since Steve took the job on Wednesday only, he only needs to pick the remaining pounds by Thursday. Therefore, Steve had to pick 12 pounds of lingonberries on Thursday.

Let's break down the information given:
- Steve wants to make a total of $100.
- He works for 4 days.
- Each day he earns $100 divided by 4 days = $25 per day.
- He earns $2 for every pound of lingonberries.
- On Monday he picked 8 pounds.
- On Tuesday's harvest, he picked triple what he had picked on Monday, so he picked 8 * 3 = 24 pounds.
- On Wednesday, he rested, so he didn't pick any berries.

Now, let's calculate how much Steve earned on Monday and Tuesday:
- Monday: 8 pounds * $2/pound = $16
- Tuesday: 24 pounds * $2/pound = $48

Together, he earned $16 + $48 = $64 on Monday and Tuesday.

Since his daily goal is $25, he is 25 - 64 = -$39 short from reaching his goal by Wednesday.

Therefore, to reach his goal of $100, he needs to earn an additional $100 - $64 = $36 on Thursday.

To find out how many pounds of lingonberries Steve needs to pick on Thursday, we divide $36 by the price per pound:
$36 / $2/pound = 18 pounds

So, Steve needs to pick 18 pounds of lingonberries on Thursday to reach his goal of $100.

On Monday, Steve picked 8 pounds of lingonberries.

On Tuesday, he picked triple the amount he picked on Monday, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pounds.

On Wednesday, he decided to rest, so he did not pick any berries.

We know that every pound of lingonberries earns Steve $2. So, let's calculate the money he made on Monday and Tuesday.

Money made on Monday: 8 pounds * $2/pound = $16
Money made on Tuesday: 24 pounds * $2/pound = $48

Let's add up the money made so far:
$16 + $48 = $64

Steve needs to make $100 in total, so we need to find out how many pounds of berries he needs to pick on Thursday to make the remaining $36.

Money needed on Thursday: $36

Money per pound: $2

Pieces of lingonberries needed on Thursday: $36 / $2/pound = 18 pounds
