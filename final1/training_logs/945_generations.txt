To calculate Theodore's total earnings every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the earnings from stone statues:
   - Theodore crafts 10 stone statues every month.
   - Each stone statue costs $20.
   - Therefore, earnings from stone statues = 10 * $20 = $200.

2. Calculate the earnings from wooden statues:
   - Theodore crafts 20 wooden statues every month.
   - Each wooden statue costs $5.
   - Therefore, earnings from wooden statues = 20 * $5 = $100.

3. Calculate total earnings before taxes:
   - Total earnings = earnings from stone statues + earnings from wooden statues = $200 + $100 = $300.

4. Calculate the tax (10% of total earnings):
   - Tax = 10% of $300 = 0.10 * $300 = $30.

5. Calculate the net earnings after taxes:
   - Net earnings = total earnings - tax = $300 - $30 = $270.

To determine Theodore's total earnings every month, we need to calculate his revenue from both stone and wooden statues, then subtract the taxes he pays.

1. Calculate the revenue from stone statues:
   - Theodore crafts 10 stone statues every month.
   - Each stone statue costs $20.
   - Revenue from stone statues = 10 * $20 = $200.

2. Calculate the revenue from wooden statues:
   - Theodore crafts 20 wooden statues every month.
   - Each wooden statue costs $5.
   - Revenue from wooden statues = 20 * $5 = $100.

3. Calculate the total revenue:
   - Total revenue = Revenue from stone statues + Revenue from wooden statues
   - Total revenue = $200 + $100 = $300.

4. Calculate the taxes:
   - Theodore pays 10% of his total earnings in taxes.
   - Taxes = 10% of $300 = 0.10 * $300 = $30.

5. Calculate the net earnings:
   - Net earnings = Total revenue - Taxes
   - Net earnings = $300 - $30 = $270.

Thus, Theodore's total earnings every month are $270.

To calculate Theodore's total earnings every month, we first need to determine the revenue from stone and wooden statues separately.

Revenue from stone statues:
\( 10 \text{ stone statues/month} \times \$20/\text{stone statue} = \$200 \text{/month} \)

Revenue from wooden statues:
\( 20 \text{ wooden statues/month} \times \$5/\text{wooden statue} = \$100 \text{/month} \)

Total earnings before taxes:
\( \$200 + \$100 = \$300 \text{/month} \)

Taxes:
\( 10\% \times \$300 = \$30 \)

Total earnings after taxes:
\( \$300 - \$30 = \$270 \text{/month} \)

Therefore, Theodore's total earning every month is $270.

To calculate Theodore's total earnings every month, we first need to determine his earnings from stone and wooden statues. 

For stone statues:
He can craft 10 stone statues every month, and each statue costs $20.
So, his earnings from stone statues = 10 statues * $20/stone = $200.

For wooden statues:
He can craft 20 wooden statues every month, and each statue costs $5.
So, his earnings from wooden statues = 20 statues * $5/wooden statue = $100.

Now we add these two amounts together:
Total earnings before taxes = Earnings from stone statues + Earnings from wooden statues
Total earnings before taxes = $200 + $100 = $300.

After deducting 10% in taxes, his total earnings every month would be:
Total earnings after taxes = Total earnings before taxes - (Total earnings before taxes * 10%)
Total earnings after taxes = $300 - ($300 * 0.10) = $300 - $30 = $270.

Therefore, Theodore's total monthly earnings are $270.

To determine Theodore's total earnings every month, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the earnings from stone statues: 
   Theodore crafts 10 stone statues per month. Each stone statue is sold for $20.
   Earnings from stone statues = 10 statues * $20/stone = $200.

2. Calculate the earnings from wooden statues:
   Theodore crafts 20 wooden statues per month. Each wooden statue is sold for $5.
   Earnings from wooden statues = 20 statues * $5/statue = $100.

1. To calculate Theodore's total earnings every month, we first need to calculate his earnings from stone statues and wooden statues.
   - He can craft 10 stone statues per month, and each statue is sold for $20.
     So, from stone statues, he earns \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

   - He can craft 20 wooden statues per month, and each statue is sold for $5.
     So, from wooden statues, he earns \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \) dollars.

   - The total earnings before taxes are the sum of earnings from both types of statues, which is \( 200 + 100 = 300 \) dollars.

   - Now, Theodore pays 10 percent of his total earnings in taxes. To calculate the taxes, we multiply the total earnings by 10 percent:
     \( 300 \times 0.10 = 30 \) dollars.

   - The net earnings, which are his total earnings after taxes are deducted, will be the total earnings minus the taxes, which is \( 300 - 30 = 270 \) dollars.

To calculate Theodore's total earnings every month, we first need to determine his monthly earnings from crafting stone statues and wooden statues separately, and then sum these amounts. 

1. Earnings from stone statues:
Teddy can craft 10 stone statues every month and each statue costs $20.
Number of stone statues per month = 10
Cost per stone statue = $20
Total earnings from stone statues = Number of stone statues per month * Cost per stone statue
= 10 * $20 = $200

2. Earnings from wooden statues:
Teddy can craft 20 wooden statues every month and each statue costs $5.
Number of wooden statues per month = 20
Cost per wooden statue = $5
Total earnings from wooden statues = Number of wooden statues per month * Cost per wooden statue
= 20 * $5 = $100

Now, sum the earnings from stone statues and wooden statues to find the total earnings before taxes:
Total earnings before taxes = Earnings from stone statues + Earnings from wooden statues
= $200 + $100 = $300

3. Taxes:
Teddy pays 10 percent of his total earnings in taxes.
Total earnings before taxes = $300
Taxes = 10% of Total earnings before taxes
= 0.10 * $300 = $30

4. Net earnings:
Net earnings = Total earnings before taxes - Taxes
= $300 - $30 = $270

Therefore, Theodore's total earnings every month are $270.

For wooden statues:
- Theodore crafts 20 wooden statues per month.
- Each wooden statue costs $5.
- Total earnings from wooden statues = 20 * $5 = $100.

Now, we add the earnings from both types of statues:
Total earnings from statues = $200 + $100 = $300.

Next, we need to calculate the taxes Theodore has to pay:
- He pays 10 percent of his total earnings in taxes.
- Tax amount = 10% of $300 = 0.1 * $300 = $30.

Finally, we subtract the taxes from his total earnings to get his net earnings:

To determine Theodore's total monthly earnings, we need to calculate the revenue from stone statues, the revenue from wooden statues, and then account for taxes.

1. **Revenue from stone statues**: 
   Theodore crafts 10 stone statues per month, and each stone statue sells for $20. So, his total revenue from stone statues is:
   \[
   10 \text{ stone statues} \times \$20/\text{stone} = \$200
   \]

2. **Revenue from wooden statues**:
   Theodore crafts 20 wooden statues per month, and each wooden statue sells for $5. So, his total revenue from wooden statues is:
   \[
   20 \text{ wooden statues} \times \$5/\text{wooden statue} = \$100
   \]

3. **Total revenue before taxes**:
   Adding the revenue from both stone and wooden statues gives:
   \[
   \$200 + \$100 = \$300
   \]

4. **Taxes**:
   Theodore pays 10 percent of his total earnings in taxes. So, his total tax is:
   \[
   10\% \times \$300 = 0.10 \times \$300 = \$30
   \]

5. **Total earnings after taxes**:
   Subtracting the taxes from the total revenue gives:
   \[
   \$300 - \$30 = \$270
   \]

Therefore, Theodore's total monthly earnings after taxes are $270.

To calculate Theodore's total earnings every month, we will first find out his earnings from the stone statues and wooden statues separately, and then sum them up. 

For stone statues:
- Each stone statue is sold for $20.
- Theodore can craft 10 stone statues every month.
- Therefore, his earnings from stone statues per month = 10 stone statues/month * $20/stone statue = $200/month.

For wooden statues:
- Each wooden statue is sold for $5.
- Theodore can craft 20 wooden statues every month.
- Therefore, his earnings from wooden statues per month = 20 wooden statues/month * $5/wooden statue = $100/month.

Now, let's find out his total earnings from both types of statues without considering taxes. 
- Total earnings from stone statues = $200/month.
- Total earnings from wooden statues = $100/month.
- Therefore, his total earnings per month = $200 + $100 = $300/month.

Next, we need to calculate the taxes deducted from his total earnings. 
- He pays 10 percent of his total earnings in taxes.
- Therefore, his taxes per month = 10% of $300 = 0.10 * $300 = $30/month.

Finally, to find Theodore's total earnings every month after tax deductions, we subtract his taxes from his total earnings.
- Total earnings after taxes = $300 - $30 = $270/month.

So, Theodore's total earning every month after taxes is $270.
