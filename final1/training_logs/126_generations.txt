Let's denote the number of roommates Bob has as B and the number of roommates John has as J. According to the information given:

1. John has five more roommates than twice as many as Bob.
2. Bob has 10 roommates, so J = 2 * B + 5.

Now we can find the number of roommates John has:

J = 2 * 10 + 5
J = 20 + 5
J = 25

So, John has 25 roommates.
