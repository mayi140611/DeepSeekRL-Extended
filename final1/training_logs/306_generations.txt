system
To find the average height for the three of them, we first need to determine the heights of Parker and Daisy.

1. **Reese's height:**
   Reese is given as 60 inches tall.

2. **Daisy's height:**
   Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese.
   \[
   \text{Daisy's height} = 60 \text{ inches} + 8 \text{ inches} = 68 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Parker's height:**
   Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy.
   \[
   \text{Parker's height} = 68 \text{ inches} - 4 \text{ inches} = 64 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we calculate the average height for the three of them (Reese, Daisy, and Parker).

4. **Total height:**
   \[
   \text{Total height} = 60 \text{ inches} + 68 \text{ inches} + 64 \text{ inches} = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Average height:**
   \[
   \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{3} = \frac{192 \text{ inches}}{3} = 64 \text{ inches}
   \]

**Answer:**
The average height for the three of them is \(64\) inches.

To find the average height of Parker, Daisy, and Reese, we need to first determine each of their heights.

1. We know that Reese is 60 inches tall.
2. Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese, so Daisy's height is \(60 + 8 = 68\) inches.
3. Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, so Parker's height is \(68 - 4 = 64\) inches.

Now we have the heights of all three individuals:
- Reese: 60 inches
- Daisy: 68 inches
- Parker: 64 inches

To find the average height, we sum their heights and divide by the number of people:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Sum of heights}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{60 + 68 + 64}{3} = \frac{192}{3} = 64 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, the average height for the three of them is 64 inches.

The difference in height between Daisy and Reese is 8 inches. So, Daisy is 60 + 8 = 68 inches tall.
The difference in height between Parker and Daisy is 4 inches. So, Parker is 68 - 4 = 64 inches tall.

The total height of the three of them is 60 + 68 + 64 = 192 inches.
The average height for the three is 192 / 3 = 64 inches.

Let's break it down step by step:
1. Reese's height: 60 inches
2. Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese: 60 inches + 8 inches = 68 inches
3. Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy: 68 inches - 4 inches = 64 inches

Now let's calculate the average height:
Average height = (Reese's height + Daisy's height + Parker's height) / 3
Average height = (60 inches + 68 inches + 64 inches) / 3
Average height = 192 inches / 3
Average height = 64 inches

To find the average height of Parker, Daisy, and Reese, we first need to determine their individual heights based on the given information:

1. Reese's height is 60 inches.
2. Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese, so Daisy's height is:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's height} = 60 + 8 = 68 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, so Parker's height is:
   \[
   \text{Parker's height} = 68 - 4 = 64 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we calculate the average height by summing their heights and dividing by the number of individuals:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Reese's height} + \text{Daisy's height} + \text{Parker's height}}{3} = \frac{60 + 68 + 64}{3}
\]

Let's add the heights together:

\[
60 + 68 + 64 = 192
\]

Now, divide by 3 to find the average:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{192}{3} = 64 \text{ inches}

To find the average height of Parker, Daisy, and Reese, we first need to determine their individual heights based on the given information.

Reese's height is given directly: 60 inches.

Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese, so we calculate Daisy's height as follows:
\[ \text{Daisy's height} = \text{Reese's height} + 8 \text{ inches} = 60 \text{ inches} + 8 \text{ inches} = 68 \text{ inches} \]

Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, so we calculate Parker's height as follows:
\[ \text{Parker's height} = \text{Daisy's height} - 4 \text{ inches} = 68 \text{ inches} - 4 \text{ inches} = 64 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the total height of Parker, Daisy, and Reese by adding their heights together:
\[ \text{Total height} = \text{Reese's height} + \text{Daisy's height} + \text{Parker's height} = 60 \text{ inches} + 68 \text{ inches} + 64 \text{ inches} = 192 \text{ inches} \]

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of people (which is 3):
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{3} = \frac{192 \text{ inches}}{3} = 64 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the average height for the three of them is 64 inches.

Parker = Daisy -4 (since Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy)
Daisy = Reese + 8 (since Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese)

We are given that Reese is 60 inches tall, so Daisy = 60 + 8 = 68 inches tall.
Daisy is 68 inches, and since Parker is 4 inches shorter, Parker = 68 - 4 = 64 inches tall.

Now, we calculate the total height:
Reese + Daisy + Parker = 60 + 68 + 64 = 192 inches

First, we need to find Daisy's height. Since Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese, we calculate Daisy's height as follows:
\( \text{Daisy's height} = \text{Reese's height} + 8 \)
\( \text{Daisy's height} = 60 + 8 \)
\( \text{Daisy's height} = 68 \) inches

Next, we calculate Parker's height. Since Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, we calculate Parker's height as follows:
\( \text{Parker's height} = \text{Daisy's height} - 4 \)
\( \text{Parker's height} = 68 - 4 \)
\( \text{Parker's height} = 64 \) inches

Now we can find the average height for the three of them by summing their heights and dividing by 3:
\( \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Reese's height} + \text{Daisy's height} + \text{Parker's height}}{3} \)
\( \text{Average height} = \frac{60 + 68 + 64}{3} \)
\( \text{Average height} = \frac{192}{3} \)
\( \text{Average height} = 64 \) inches

Therefore, the average height for the three of them is 64 inches.

To find the average height, we need to figure out each person's height based on the given information. 

Reese's height is 60 inches.

Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese, so:
Daisy = Reese + 8
Daisy = 60 inches + 8 inches
Daisy = 68 inches

Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, so:
Parker = Daisy - 4
Parker = 68 inches - 4 inches
Parker = 64 inches

Now, we add the heights of both girls and the boys to find the total height:
Total height = Reese height + Daisy height + Parker height
Total height = 60 inches + 68 inches + 64 inches
Total height = 192 inches

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of people, which is 3:
Average height = Total height / Number of people
Average height = 192 inches / 3
Average height = 64 inches

Therefore, the average height for the three of them is 64 inches.

To find the average height for Parker, Daisy, and Reese, we first need to calculate their individual heights based on the given information. 

1. We know that Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese. Since Reese is 60 inches tall, Daisy's height is:
\[ \text{Daisy's height} = \text{Reese's height} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Daisy's height} = 60 + 8 = 68 \text{ inches} \]

2. Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy. So we subtract 4 inches from Daisy's height to find Parker's height:
\[ \text{Parker's height} = \text{Daisy's height} - 4 \]
\[ \text{Parker's height} = 68 - 4 = 64 \text{ inches} \]

Now we have all three heights: Reese (60 inches), Daisy (68 inches), and Parker (64 inches).

To find the average height, we sum their heights and divide by the number of people:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Reese's height} + \text{Daisy's height} + \text{Parker's height}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{60 + 68 + 64}{3} \]

Let's calculate each person's height step by step.

1. Reese's height is given as 60 inches.

2. Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese, so we add 8 inches to Reese's height:
   \[
   60 \text{ inches} + 8 \text{ inches} = 68 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, so we subtract 4 inches from Daisy's height:
   \[
   68 \text{ inches} - 4 \text{ inches} = 64 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we have the heights of each person:
- Reese: 60 inches
- Daisy: 68 inches
- Parker: 64 inches

Next, we calculate the average height:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Reese's height} + \text{Daisy's height} + \text{Parker's height}}{3}
\]
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{60 \text{ inches} + 68 \text{ inches} + 64 \text{ inches}}{3}
\]
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{192 \text{ inches}}{3}

First, we need to determine how tall Daisy and Parker are. Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese, so:

Daisy = Reese + 8 inches
       = 60 inches + 8 inches
       = 68 inches

Next, Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, so:

Parker = Daisy - 4 inches
       = 68 inches - 4 inches
       = 64 inches

Now we know the heights for all three of them:
Reese: 60 inches
Daisy: 68 inches
Parker: 64 inches

To find the average height, we add up their heights and divide by the number of people:

Average height = (Reese + Daisy + Parker) / 3
                  = (60 inches + 68 inches + 64 inches) / 3
                  = 192 inches / 3
