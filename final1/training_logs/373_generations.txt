#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the cost of one small tub as \( x \).

Since Alison bought 3 large tubs at $6 each, the total cost for the large tubs is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars.

Similarly, the total cost for the 6 small tubs is \( 6x \).

The total cost for both the large and small tubs is $48, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 18 + 6x = 48 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 6x = 48 - 18 \]
\[ 6x = 30 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the small tubs cost $5 each.

To find the cost of the small storage tubs, we first need to determine the total cost of the large tubs and the total cost of the small tubs separately.

We know that Alison bought 3 large tubs at $6 each, so the total cost for the large tubs is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know the total cost for both the large and small tubs is $48. So, to find the total cost of the small tubs, we subtract the total cost of the large tubs from the total cost of all tubs:
\[ 48 - 18 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Alison bought 6 small tubs, and the total cost for the small tubs is $30. To find the cost of one small tub, we divide the total cost of the small tubs by the number of small tubs:
\[ 30 \div 6 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the small tubs cost $5 each.

To find the cost of the small storage tubs, we can start by determining the cost of the large storage tubs. Alison bought 3 large storage tubs for a total of $48. 

Total cost of large tubs = $48

Cost of each large tub = $6

Number of large tubs = 3

Total cost of large tubs = Cost per large tub × Number of large tubs
$48 = $6 × 3

Now, we know that Alison also bought 6 small storage tubs. Let's denote the cost of one small tub as S.

Total cost of all tubs = Cost of large tubs + Cost of small tubs

We already know the total cost of large tubs, so we can calculate the total cost of small tubs:

$48 = $48 + S × 6

Now we subtract $48 from both sides to solve for S:

S × 6 = $48 - $48

S × 6 = $0

S = $0 / 6

S = $0

So, the small storage tubs cost $0 each.

Let's calculate the total cost of the large and small tubs separately.
Total cost of large tubs = 3 * $6 = $18
Total cost of small tubs = $48 (total cost) - $18 (cost of large tubs) = $30
Total number of large tubs = 3
Total number of small tubs = 6

Let's denote the cost of a large tub as \( L \) and the cost of a small tub as \( S \). According to the problem, we have:

1. Alison bought 3 large tubs and 6 small tubs for $48 in total.
2. Each large tub costs $6.

So, the equation for the total cost can be written as:

\[ 3L + 6S = 48 \]

We know \( L = 6 \), so we substitute this into the equation:

\[ 3(6) + 6S = 48 \]

\[ 18 + 6S = 48 \]

Now, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):

\[ 6S = 48 - 18 \]

\[ 6S = 30 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{30}{6} \]

\[ S = 5 \]

So, the small tubs cost $5 each.

Let's denote the cost of a small storage tub as \( S \).

From the information given, we know that Alison bought 3 large storage tubs and 6 small ones for a total of $48. We also know that the cost of a large storage tub is $6. So, the cost of the 3 large storage tubs would be \( 3 \times 6 = $18 \).

The total cost for the 6 small storage tubs would be \( 6 \times S \).

The total cost of all storage tubs is the sum of the cost of the large tubs and the small tubs, which is $48.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 18 + 6S = 48 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \).

\[ 6S = 48 - 18 \]
\[ 6S = 30 \]
\[ S = \frac{30}{6} \]
\[ S = 5 \]

The cost of each small storage tub is $5.

To find the cost of the small tubs, we first subtract the cost of the large tubs from the total cost to get the cost of the small tubs. We know the total cost is $48 and the cost of the three large tubs are $18. So, $48 - $18 = $30. Now, we divide the total cost of the small tubs by the number of small tubs, which is 6, to get the cost of each small tub. $30 / 6 = $5.

Let the cost of the small storage tub be x.

The total cost of the large tubs is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost of the small tubs is 6 * x.

The equation representing the total cost is:

$18 + 6x = $48

Now, you can solve for x:

6x = $48 - $18 = $30

x = $30 / 6

x = $5

To find the cost of the small storage tubs, we can first calculate the total cost of the large storage tubs. Since each large tub costs $6 and Alison bought 3 of them, the total cost of the large tubs is:

\[ 3 \text{ large tubs} \times \$6 \text{ per large tub} = \$18 \]

Alison spent a total of $48 on all the storage tubs. The total cost of all the storage tubs is the sum of the cost of the large tubs and the cost of the small tubs. Let's denote the cost of one small tub as \( S \). Then, the total cost can be expressed as:

\[ \$18 + (6 \text{ small tubs} \times S) = \$48 \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S = \$48 - \$18 \]
\[ 6S = \$30 \]
\[ S = \frac{\$30}{6} \]
\[ S = \$5 \]

So, the small tubs cost $5 each.

To find out how much the small tubs cost, we can start by calculating the total cost of the large tubs Alison bought. We know that 3 large tubs cost $6 each, so the total cost for the large tubs is 3 * 6 = $18. 

The total cost for the 6 small tubs can be found by subtracting the cost of the large tubs from the total cost. So, the total cost for the small tubs is $48 - $18 = $30.

Now that we know the total cost for the small tubs, we can find out how much each small tub costs. Since Alison bought 6 small tubs for a total of $30, each small tub costs $30 / 6 = $5.

To determine the cost of the small tubs, we start by finding the total cost of the large tubs which we know from the problem statement. Alison bought 3 large tubs and the total cost for the large tubs was $48. The cost for one large tub is $6. So, the total cost for 3 large tubs is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars.

This means, the cost for the small tubs was \( 48 - 18 = 30 \) dollars. If the small tubs cost $x each, then for 6 small tubs, the total cost is \( 6x = 30 \). To find the cost of one small tub, we divide $30 by 6, which gives \( \frac{30}{6} = 5 \) dollars.

Therefore,

<reasoning>
We know the total cost of large tubs is $48 and each large tub costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for 3 large tubs is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars. Thus, the cost for the small tubs is \( 48 - 18 = 30 \) dollars. Since there are 6 small tubs, we can find the cost per small tub by dividing 30 dollars by 6, which is \( 5 \) dollars.

To determine the cost of the small storage tubs, we first need to find the cost of the large tubs and then subtract that from the total cost. Here are the steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the large tubs:**
   Alison bought 3 large tubs, and each large tub costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for the large tubs is:
   \[
   3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the small tubs:**
   Alison spent a total of $48 on storage tubs. If $18 was spent on the large tubs, the cost of the small tubs is the total cost minus the cost of the large tubs:
   \[
   48 - 18 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of one small tub:**
   Alison bought 6 small tubs. Therefore, the cost of one small tub is:
   \[
   \frac{30}{6} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the cost of one small tub is $5.

Let's denote the cost of the small storage tubs as \( x \). Alison bought 3 large tubs and 6 small tubs, and the total cost was $48. We know that each large tub costs $6. Therefore, the cost of the 3 large tubs is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars. The cost of the 6 small tubs can be expressed as \( 6x \). The total cost is the sum of the cost of the large tubs and the small tubs, which is given by the equation:

\[ 18 + 6x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( 6x \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 6x = 48 - 18 \]
\[ 6x = 30 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 6:

\[ x = \frac{30}{6} \]
