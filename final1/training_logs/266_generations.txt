#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
John spends 1 hour lifting weights daily. He dedicates a third of this time to warming up and cardio, which means he spends \( \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3} \) hour warming up and cardio daily.

So in total, he spends \( 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \) hours each day at the gym.

Since he goes to the gym 3 times a week, he spends \( 3 \times \frac{4}{3} = 4 \) hours at the gym a week.

He spends 1/3*1 = 1/3 hour warming up and doing cardio each day. So he spends 1+1/3 = 4/3 hours at the gym each day. So he spends 4/3*3 = 4 hours a week.

John spends 1 hour each day lifting weights, and since he goes to the gym 3 times a week, he spends 1 hour x 3 days = 3 hours lifting weights per week.
Additionally, he spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio, which means he spends 1 hour x 1/3 = 1/3 hour warming up and doing cardio each day.
Since he goes to the gym 3 times a week, he spends 1/3 hour x 3 days = 1 hour warming up and doing cardio per week.

Therefore, the total time he spends at the gym per week is 3 hours (lifting weights) + 1 hour (warming up and doing cardio) = 4 hours.

John spends 1 hour lifting weights each day, and a third of this time is spent on warming up and cardio. So, he spends 1 hour * 1/3 = 1/3 hour each day on warming up and cardio.

Therefore, the total time he spends at the gym each day is 1 hour (lifting) + 1/3 hour (warming up and cardio) = 4/3 hour.

Since he goes to the gym 3 times a week, he spends 4/3 hour * 3 = 4 hours at the gym each week.

John spends 1 hour lifting weights per day. He spends a third of this time on warming up and cardio, which is \(1 \div 3 = \frac{1}{3}\) hour. So, for warming up and cardio, he spends \(\frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}\) hour per day. Adding the weightlifting time and the warming up/cooling down time together, he spends \(1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\) hours per day at the gym. Since he goes to the gym 3 times a week, he spends \(3 \times \frac{4}{3} = 4\) hours at the gym each week.

John spends 1 hour each day lifting weights. He also spends a third of that time warming up and doing cardio, which is \(1 \text{ hour} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour}\). Since he goes to the gym 3 times a week, he adds up his daily times to find the total time spent at the gym in a week:

\[
3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/day} + \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour/day} = 3 + \frac{1}{3} = 3 \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours}

John spends 1 hour each day lifting weights, which is his primary activity. He also spends a third of this time on warming up and cardio. Since he spends 1 hour lifting weights, he spends 1 / 3 * 1 = 1/3 hour on warming up and cardio each day. 

However, the question asks how many hours he spends at the gym a week, but it doesn't specify if the 30 minutes of cardio and warming up is done in a single day or each of the 3 days. Assuming the 1/3 is done per day, then he spends 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 hours a day at the gym. 

4/3 hours * 7 days = 28/3 hours = 9.33 hours

John lifts weights for 1 hour each day, which amounts to \(1 \times 7 = 7\) hours for the week.

He spends a third of his weightlifting time on warming up and cardio each day. So, he spends \(1/3 \times 1 = 1/3\) hour on warming up and cardio each day.

Therefore, the total time he spends each day at the gym is \(1 + 1/3 = 4/3 \) hours.

So, he spends \(4/3 \times 7 = 28/3\) hours a week.

John spends 1 hour per day lifting weights. This means he spends \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) hours lifting weights in total per week.

He also spends a third of his weightlifting time on warming up and cardio, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3} \) hour per day for warming up and cardio.

Therefore, the total time he spends on warming up and cardio per week is \( 3 \) hours (from lifting weights) plus \( \frac{1}{3} \) hour (additional cardio time) = \( 3 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{10}{3} = 3 \frac{1}{3} \) hours per week.

To find the total time he spends at the gym each week, we add his weightlifting time and his warming up and cardio time: \( 3 + 3 \frac{1}{3} = 6 \frac{1}{3} \) hours per week.
