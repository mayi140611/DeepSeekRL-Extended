To determine the total number of feet John climbed, we first need to find the number of steps in each staircase and then convert that into feet.

The first staircase has 20 steps.
The second staircase has twice as many steps as the first, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) steps.
The final staircase has 10 fewer steps than the second one, which is \(40 - 10 = 30\) steps.

Now, we calculate the total number of steps:
\[20 + 40 + 30 = 90\] steps.

Since each step is 0.5 feet, the total number of feet climbed is:
\[90 \times 0.5 = 45\] feet.

Therefore, John climbed 45 feet in total.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first staircase has 20 steps. Each step is 0.5 feet.
   \[ 20 \text{ steps} \times 0.5 \text{ feet/step} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

2. The second staircase has twice as many steps as the first staircase.
   \[ 2 \times 20 \text{ steps} = 40 \text{ steps} \]
   Each step is 0.5 feet.
   \[ 40 \text{ steps} \times 0.5 \text{ feet/step} = 20 \text{ feet} \]

3. The final staircase has 10 fewer steps than the second staircase.
   \[ 40 \text{ steps} - 10 \text{ steps} = 30 \text{ steps} \]
   Each step is 0.5 feet.
   \[ 30 \text{ steps} \times 0.5 \text{ feet/step} = 15 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we add up the total feet for all the staircases:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} + 20 \text{ feet} + 15 \text{ feet} = 45 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, John climbed a total of 45 feet.

To determine the total number of feet John climbed, we first need to find the number of steps in each staircase and then convert those steps into feet.

1. The first staircase has 20 steps.
2. The second staircase has twice as many steps as the first staircase, so it has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) steps.
3. The third staircase has 10 fewer steps than the second one, so it has \(40 - 10 = 30\) steps.

Next, we calculate the total number of steps across all three staircases:
\[ 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 \text{ steps} \]

Each step is 0.5 feet, so the total distance climbed in feet is:
\[ 90 \text{ steps} \times 0.5 \text{ feet/step} = 45 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, John climbed a total of 45 feet.

3. The final staircase has 10 fewer steps than the second one, so it has \(40 - 10 = 30\) steps.

Now, we sum the steps from all three staircases:
\[20 \text{ (first staircase)} + 40 \text{ (second staircase)} + 30 \text{ (final staircase)} = 90 \text{ steps}\]

Each step is 0.5 feet, so to find out how many feet John climbs, we multiply the total number of steps by the height of each step:
\[90 \text{ steps} \times 0.5 \text{ feet/step} = 45 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, John climbed a total of 45 feet.

To determine the total feet John climbed, we need to calculate the number of steps in each staircase and then convert the total number of steps into feet.

1. First staircase:
   - Number of steps = 20 steps

2. Second staircase:
   - Number of steps = 2 * (first staircase) = 2 * 20 = 40 steps

3. Third staircase:
   - Number of steps = Second staircase - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30 steps

Now we sum up the steps for all the staircases:
   - Total steps = 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 steps

Each step is 0.5 feet. So to convert steps to feet:
   - Total feet = Total steps * 0.5
   - Total feet = 90 * 0.5 = 45 feet

So, John climbed a total of 45 feet.
