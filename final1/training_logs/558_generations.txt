system
Let's denote Luna's house rental budget as \( H \) and her food budget as \( F \). According to the problem, Luna's food budget is 60% of her house rental budget, so we have:

\[ F = 0.6 \times H \]

We also know that the total budget for house rental and food is $240, so we can write:

\[ H + F = 240 \]

Substituting \( F = 0.6 \times H \) into the equation above, we get:

\[ H + 0.6H = 240 \]
\[ 1.6H = 240 \]
\[ H = \frac{240}{1.6} = 150 \]

Now we can find Luna's food budget:

\[ F = 0.6 \times 150 = 90 \]

Next, we need to find the phone bill budget, which is 10% of her food budget:

\[ \text{Phone bill} = 0.1 \times F = 0.1 \times 90 = 9 \]

To find Luna's total monthly budget for all expenses, we add together all the budgets:

\[ \text{Total budget} = H + F + \text{Phone bill} = 150 + 90 + 9 = 249 \]

Therefore, Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses is $249.

Let's denote the house rental budget by \( R \). According to the problem, Luna's food budget \( F \) is 60% of her house rental budget, so we have:
\[ F = 0.6R \]

The total budget for house rental and food is given as $240. Therefore, we can write:
\[ R + F = 240 \]
Substituting \( F \) from the first equation:
\[ R + 0.6R = 240 \]
\[ 1.6R = 240 \]
\[ R = \frac{240}{1.6} \]
\[ R = 150 \]

Now, we know the house rental budget is $150. Using this, we can find the food budget \( F \):
\[ F = 0.6 \times 150 = 90 \]

Next, we need to determine Luna's phone bill budget \( P \), which is 10% of her food budget:
\[ P = 0.1F = 0.1 \times 90 = 9 \]

Now, we can find the total monthly budget for all these expenses by summing household rent, food budget, and phone bill:
\[ \text{Total budget} = R + F + P = 150 + 90 + 9 = 249 \]

Therefore, Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses is:
\[ 249 \]

Given that Luna's monthly food budget is 60% of her house rental budget, let's denote the house rental budget as \( H \) and the food budget as \( F \). From the problem, we have:
\[
F = 0.6H
\]
The total budget for house rental and food is $240:
\[
H + F = 240
\]
Substituting \( F = 0.6H \) into the equation, we get:
\[
H + 0.6H = 240
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
1.6H = 240
\]
Solving for \( H \), we get:
\[
H = \frac{240}{1.6} = 150
\]
Now, using \( F = 0.6H \), we can find \( F \):
\[
F = 0.6 \times 150 = 90
\]
Next, we know that Luna's phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget, so let's denote the phone bill budget as \( P \):
\[
P = 0.1F = 0.1 \times 90 = 9
\]
Adding all the budgets together, we get Luna's total monthly budget:
\[
H + F + P = 150 + 90 + 9 = 249

Let's denote the house rental budget as \( H \) and the food budget as \( F \). According to the problem, Luna's food budget is 60% of her house rental budget, so we have:

\[ F = 0.60H \]

We are also given that the total budget for the house rental and food budget is $240, which implies:

\[ H + F = 240 \]

Substituting \( F = 0.60H \) into the equation, we get:

\[ H + 0.60H = 240 \]
\[ 1.60H = 240 \]
\[ H = \frac{240}{1.60} \]
\[ H = 150 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 150 \) back into the equation for \( F \), we get:

\[ F = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Next, we are given that Luna's phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget. Let's denote the phone bill budget as \( P \). So:

\[ P = 0.10F \]
\[ P = 0.10 \times 90 = 9 \]

So, the total monthly budget for all these expenses is the sum of the house rental budget, the food budget, and the phone bill budget:

\[ H + F + P \]
\[ 150 + 90 + 9 = 249 \]

Therefore, Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses is $249.

Let's denote the house rental budget as \( R \) and the food budget as \( F \).

According to the problem:

1. Luna's food budget \( F = 0.60 \times R \)
2. Luna's house rental budget \( R = 240 - F \) (since the total budget for house rental and food is $240)

Substitute the first equation into the second to get Luna's house rental budget in terms of food budget:

\( R = 240 - 0.60 \times R \)

Solving this equation for \( R \):

\( R + 0.60 \times R = 240 \)

\( 1.60 \times R = 240 \)

\( R = 240 / 1.60 \)

\( R = 150 \)

Now we can calculate Luna's food budget:

\( F = 0.60 \times R \)

\( F = 0.60 \times 150 \)

\( F = 90 \)

Finally, we can calculate Luna's total monthly budget to pay all the expenses:

\( Total = R + F \)

\( Total = 150 + 90 \)

\( Total = 240 \)

So, Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses is $240.

Let's denote the food budget as \( F \) and the house rental budget as \( H \). According to the problem, the food budget \( F \) is equal to 60% of the house rental budget \( H \), which can be written as:

\[ F = 0.6H \]

We are also given that the total budget for house rental and food is $240:

\[ F + H = 240 \]

Substituting the value of \( F \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 0.6H + H = 240 \]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[ 1.6H = 240 \]

Solving for \( H \), we divide both sides by 1.6:

\[ H = \frac{240}{1.6} = 150 \]

Now that we have the house rental budget \( H \), we can find the food budget \( F \):

\[ F = 0.6 \times 150 = 90 \]

The phone bill budget is 10% of the food budget, so:

\[ \text{Phone bill budget} = 0.1 \times F = 0.1 \times 90 = 9 \]

Finally, the total monthly budget is the sum of the house rental budget, the food budget, and the phone bill budget:

\[ \text{Total budget} = H + F + \text{Phone bill budget} = 150 + 90 + 9 = 249 \]

Therefore, Luna's total monthly budget is $249.

Let's denote Luna's monthly food budget as \( F \) and her monthly house rental budget as \( H \).

From the given information, we know:
1. \( F = 0.60H \)
2. \( F + H = 240 \)

Substitute \( F = 0.60H \) into the second equation:

\( 0.60H + H = 240 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 1.60H = 240 \)

Now, solve for \( H \):

\( H = \frac{240}{1.60} \)

\( H = 150 \)

Now, substitute \( H = 150 \) back into the equation \( F = 0.60H \) to find \( F \):

\( F = 0.60 \times 150 \)

\( F = 90 \)

So, Luna's monthly food budget is $90.

Next, Luna's phone bill is 10% of her food budget. Let's denote the phone bill as \( P \).

\( P = 0.10F \)

\( P = 0.10 \times 90 \)

\( P = 9 \)

Finally, to find Luna's total monthly budget to pay all expenses, we add up all the expenses:

\( Total = F + H + P \)

\( Total = 90 + 150 + 9 \)

\( Total = 249 \)

So, Luna's total monthly budget to pay all expenses amounts to $249.

Let's denote the house rental budget by \( H \), the food budget by \( F \), and the phone bill budget by \( P \).

According to the problem, Luna's monthly food budget is 60% of her house rental budget:
\[ F = 0.6H \]

The problem also suggests that Luna's phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget, but this appears to be a misinterpretation or a typo. Based on the correct information provided, the correct representation should be:
\[ P = 0.1F \]

We are given that the total budget of house rental and food budget is $240:
\[ H + F = 240 \]

Substitute the expression for \( F \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 0.6H + H = 240 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1.6H = 240 \]

Solve for \( H \):
\[ H = \frac{240}{1.6} \]
\[ H = 150 \]

Now, substitute \( H \) back into the equation for \( F \):
\[ F = 0.6 \times 150 \]
\[ F = 90 \]

Finally, we need to find the total monthly budget to pay all expenses, which is the sum of the house rental budget, the food budget, and the phone bill budget:
\[ H + F + P = 150 + 90 + P \]

We know \( P = 0.1F \), and since \( F = 90 \), then:
\[ P = 0.1 \times 90 \]
\[ P = 9 \]

So, the total monthly budget is:
\[ 150 + 90 + 9 = 249 \]

However, there appears to be a misinterpretation in the problem statement, suggesting that the phone bill budget should be 10% of Luna's food budget rather than 10% of her overall budget. Given the provided information and the correct interpretation, the solution remains:

\[ H + F + P = 150 + 90 + 9 = \boxed{249} \]

This solution assumes the phone bill budget is 10% of the food budget based on the given information. If the interpretation of the phone bill percentage is meant to be 10% of the total budget, then the calculations would differ.

To find Luna's total monthly budget, we need to first determine the amount for each category based on the information given and then sum them up.

1. Let \( R \) represent the house rental budget.
2. Since the food budget is 60% of the house rental budget, the food budget \( F \) can be calculated as \( F = 0.6 \times R \).
3. The total budget (house rental and food) is $240, so \( R + F = 240 \).

Given that the food budget is 60% of the rental budget, let's find the total budget first:

\[ R + 0.6R = 240 \]
\[ 1.6R = 240 \]
\[ R = \frac{240}{1.6} \]
\[ R = 150 \]

Now, calculate the food budget:

\[ F = 0.6 \times R \]
\[ F = 0.6 \times 150 \]
\[ F = 90 \]

So, the food budget is $90.

Next, calculate the phone bill budget which is 10% of the food budget:

\[ P = 0.1 \times F \]
\[ P = 0.1 \times 90 \]
\[ P = 9 \]

Therefore, the total monthly budget to pay all these expenses is the sum of the house rental budget \( R \), the food budget \( F \), and the phone bill \( P \):

\[ \text{Total Budget} = R + F + P \]
\[ \text{Total Budget} = 150 + 90 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total Budget} = 249 \]

So, Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses is $249.
