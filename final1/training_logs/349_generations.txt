#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's assume the number of goats is x.
If the farmer has 4 more cows than goats, then the number of cows is x + 4.
If the farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, then the number of pigs is 2(x + 4) = 2x + 8.
The total number of animals is the sum of the number of goats, cows, and pigs, which is x + (x + 4) + (2x + 8) = 4x + 12.
We know that the total number of animals is 56, so we can set up the equation 4x + 12 = 56.
Solving for x, we get x = 11.
Therefore, the farmer has 11 goats.

Let G represent the number of goats. 

The farmer has 4 more cows than goats, so the number of cows is G + 4.

The farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, so the number of pigs is 2 * (G + 4).

The total number of animals is the sum of goats, cows, and pigs, which is 56. We can write an equation:

G + (G + 4) + 2 * (G + 4) = 56

Combining like terms, we get:

G + G + 4 + 2G + 8 = 56

4G + 12 = 56

Subtract 12 from both sides:

4G = 44

Divide both sides by 4:

G = 11

The farmer has 11 goats.

Let's denote the number of goats as \( G \), cows as \( C \), and pigs as \( P \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The farmer has twice as many pigs as cows: \( P = 2C \)
2. The farmer has 4 more cows than goats: \( C = G + 4 \)
3. The total number of animals is 56: \( P + C + G = 56 \)

We can substitute \( P \) and \( C \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

First, solve for \( P \) in terms of \( C \):
\[ P = 2C \]

Next, substitute \( P \) and \( C \) into the total number of animals equation:
\[ 2C + C + G = 56 \]
\[ 3C + G = 56 \]

We also know that:
\[ C = G + 4 \]

Substitute \( C \) from the above equation into the total number of animals equation:
\[ 3(G + 4) + G = 56 \]
\[ 3G + 12 + G = 56 \]
\[ 4G + 12 = 56 \]

Solve for \( G \):
\[ 4G + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 4G = 44 \]
\[ G = 11 \]

So, the farmer has 11 goats.

Verification:
If \( G = 11 \):
\[ C = G + 4 = 11 + 4 = 15 \]
\[ P = 2C = 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Check the total:
\[ P + C + G = 30 + 15 + 11 = 56 \]

The solution is verified. The farmer has \(\boxed{11}\) goats.

Let's denote the number of goats by \( G \), cows by \( C \), and pigs by \( P \).

2. A farmer has 4 more cows than goats: \( C = G + 4 \)

Let's denote the number of goats as \( G \). According to the problem:

1. The farmer has 4 more cows than goats, so the number of cows \( C \) is \( G + 4 \).
2. The farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, so the number of pigs \( P \) is \( 2 \times C = 2 \times (G + 4) \).

Then, the total number of animals can be expressed as \( P + C + G \) which equals 56. So, we have:

\[ 2(G + 4) + (G + 4) + G = 56 \]

Solving this equation will give us the number of goats.

Let's denote the number of goats as \( G \), the number of cows as \( C \), and the number of pigs as \( P \).

Given the conditions:
1. The farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, so \( P = 2C \).
2. The farmer has 4 more cows than goats, so \( C = G + 4 \).
3. The total number of animals is 56, so \( P + C + G = 56 \).

First, we substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( C \):
- \( C = G + 4 \)
- \( P = 2(C) = 2(G + 4) = 2G + 8 \)

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( C \) into the total animals equation:

Simplify and solve for \( G \):

Let's denote the number of goats as \( G \). According to the information given:
- The number of cows \( C \) is 4 more than the number of goats: \( C = G + 4 \).
- The farmer has twice as many pigs as cows: \( \text{Pigs} = 2C \).

The total number of animals is given as 56. Therefore, the equation representing the total number of animals is:
\[ G + C + \text{Pigs} = 56 \]

Substituting \( C \) with \( G + 4 \) and \( \text{Pigs} \) with \( 2C \), we get:

Simplifying this equation:

Let's denote the number of goats as \( g \). According to the problem, the farmer has 4 more cows than goats, so the number of cows \( c \) can be expressed as \( c = g + 4 \). Additionally, the number of pigs \( p \) is twice the number of cows, so \( p = 2c \).

The total number of animals is the sum of pigs, cows, and goats, which is given as 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
p + c + g = 56
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( p \) and \( c \) in terms of \( g \):

\[
2c + c + g = 56
\]

Since \( c = g + 4 \), we can substitute \( c \) in the equation:

\[
2(g + 4) + (g + 4) + g = 56
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2g + 8 + g + 4 + g = 56

Combine like terms:

\[
4g + 12 = 56

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[

Let \( G \) represent the number of goats, \( C \) represent the number of cows, and \( P \) represent the number of pigs.

Given:
1. There are 4 more cows than goats: \( C = G + 4 \).
2. There are twice as many pigs as cows: \( P = 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 56: \( P + C + G = 56 \).

First, substitute \( C \) and \( P \) from equations (1) and (2) into equation (3):

```plaintext
2C + C + G = 56
```

Combine like terms:

```plaintext
3C + G = 56

1. Substituting \( C = G + 4 \):
   ```
   3(G + 4) + G = 56
   ```

2. Expand and simplify:

```
3G + 12 + G = 56
4G + 12 = 56
```

3. Subtract 12 from both sides:

```
4G = 44
```

4. Divide by 4:

```
G = 11
```

Therefore, the number of goats is:

```
\boxed{11}
```

Verification:
- Number of goats: \( G = 11 \).
- Number of cows \( C = G + 4 = 11 + 4 = 15 \).
- Number of pigs \( P = 2C = 2 \times 15 = 30 \).
- Total: \( P + C + G = 30 + 15 + 11 = 56 \).

So the answer is \( \boxed{11} \).

Let's denote the number of goats by \( g \). According to the problem, the farmer has 4 more cows than goats, so the number of cows is \( g + 4 \). Additionally, the farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, so the number of pigs is \( 2(g + 4) \).

The total number of animals is the sum of the number of goats, cows, and pigs, which is given as 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ g + (g + 4) + 2(g + 4) = 56. \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ g + g + 4 + 2g + 8 = 56, \]
\[ 4g + 12 = 56. \]

Next, we solve for \( g \) by isolating the variable. Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4g = 44. \]

Then, divide both sides by 4:
\[ g = 11. \]

So, the farmer has \(\boxed{11}\) goats.

Verification: 
If the farmer has 11 goats, then he has \( 11 + 4 = 15 \) cows. The number of pigs is \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \). Adding all together, we get \( 11 + 15 + 30 = 56 \), which confirms our solution is correct.
