###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Mark was caught speeding and the judge wants to make an example out of him. The base fine for speeding is $50 but additional penalties apply in this case.  The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour Mark was going over the speed limit. He was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone. The fine is also doubled because he was in a school zone. Finally, the judge makes Mark pay $300 in court costs and he also has to pay his lawyer $80/hour for three hours of work. How much does Mark owe for this speeding ticket?

To calculate the total fine, we need to consider the base fine, the additional penalty for speeding over the limit, the additional penalty for being in a school zone, and the additional cost for court and lawyer fees.

1. **Base fine**: $50

2. **Addition penalty for speeding**: 75 mph - 30 mph = 45 mph over the limit. For every mph over the limit, the fine increases by $2.
   - Fine increase = 45 mph * $2/mph = $90

3. **Addition penalty for being in a school zone**: The fine is doubled.
   - Base fine * 2 = $50 * 2 = $100

4. **Court costs**: $300
5. **Lawyer's fee**: $80/hour * 3 hours = $240

Now, add all these amounts together:
- Base fine: $50
- Speeding penalty: $90
- School zone penalty: $100
- Court costs: $300
- Lawyer fees: $240

Total fine = $50 + $90 + $100 + $300 + $240 = $780

So, Mark owes a total of $780 for this speeding ticket.

First, let's calculate the amount added for going over the speed limit. Mark was going 75 mph in a 30 mph zone, so he was speeding by \(75 - 30 = 45\) mph. The fine is increased by $2 for every mph over the speed limit, so the additional fine is \(45 \times 2 = $90\).

Next, the fine is doubled because Mark was in a school zone. The doubled fine is \(90 \times 2 = $180\).

The costs for court and hiring a lawyer are calculated separately. The court costs are $300, and the lawyer charges $80 per hour for three hours, so the lawyer's fee is \(80 \times 3 = $240\).

Adding all these costs together, we get:
- The base fine: \$50
- The additional fine for going over the speed limit: \$90
- The fine doubled because of the school zone: \$180
- Court costs: \$300
- Lawyer's fee: \$240

The total fine is \(50 + 90 + 180 + 300 + 240 = $760\).

The base fine for speeding is $50.

Mark was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone, so he was going 75 - 30 = 45 miles per hour over the speed limit.

For every mile per hour over the speed limit, the fine is increased by $2. So the penalty for the overage fine is 45 * $2 = $90.

The fine is doubled because he was in a school zone, so the doubled fine is $50 * 2 = $100.

The court costs are $300.

The lawyer's fee is $80/hour * 3 hours = $240.

The total amount Mark owes is the sum of the base fine, the overage fine, the doubled fine, the court costs, and the lawyer's fee: $50 + $90 + $100 + $300 + $240 = $780.

system
To calculate the fine, we first determine the additional penalty based on the number of miles per hour above the speed limit. Mark was going 75 mph in a 30 mph zone so he was going 45 mph over the limit. 

Therefore, the additional penalty is \( 45 \text{ mph} \times $2/\text{mph} = $90 \) for speeding.

Since the base fine is $50, and the fine for speeding is increased by $2 for every mile per hour over the limit, the total fine for speeding would be:

\( $90 + $50 = $140 \).

The fine is doubled because it was in a school zone, so the new total for speeding is:

\( $140 \times 2 = $280 \).

The court costs are $300, and the cost of the lawyer's work is \( $80/hour \times 3 \text{ hours} = $240 \).

So, the total costs come to:

\( $280 + $300 + $240 = $820 \).

Therefore, Mark owes $820 for this speeding ticket.

To calculate the total fine, we need to consider the base fine and the additional penalties for speeding over the speed limit and being in a school zone. Additionally, we need to account for the court costs and the lawyer's fees. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Base fine:** $50
2. **Speeding fine:** 2 * (75 - 30) = 2 * 45 = $90
3. **School zone fine:** double the base fine * 2 = $100 * 2 = $200
4. **Court costs:** $300
5. **Lawyer's fees:** $80/hour * 3 hours = $240

Now, let's add all these amounts together to find the total fine:

\[ \text{Total fine} = \text{Base fine} + \text{Speeding fine} + \text{School zone fine} + \text{Court costs} + \text{Lawyer fees} \]

\[ \text{Total fine} = 50 + 90 + 200 + 300 + 240 \]

\[ \text{Total fine} = 880 \]

Therefore, Mark owes $880 for the speeding ticket.

To determine the total amount Mark owes for the speeding ticket, we can break down the problem into several steps and calculate each part systematically.

1. **Calculate the base fine:** The base fine for speeding is $50. Since the judge wants to make an example, this fine will be doubled.
   \[
   \text{Base fine} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Doubled fine} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the additional penalty:** The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour Mark was going over the speed limit. Mark was going 75 miles per hour, so he was over the speed limit by \(75 - 30 = 45\) miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Additional penalty} = 45 \times 2 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the court costs:** The court costs are a fixed amount of $300.
   \[
   \text{Court costs} = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the lawyer's fee:** The lawyer charges $80 per hour for three hours of work.
   \[
   \text{Lawyer's fee} = 80 \times 3 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Sum up all the amounts:** Now, we add all the amounts to get the total fine.
   \[
   \text{Total fine} = \text{Base fine} + \text{Doubled fine} + \text{Additional penalty} + \text{Court costs} + \text{Lawyer's fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fine} = 50 + 100 + 90 + 300 + 240 = 780 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Mark owes a total of $780 for this speeding ticket.

To calculate the fine, we first need to find out how much it will be increased by due to speeding. Mark was going 75 mph in a 30 mph zone, so he was going 75 - 30 = 45 mph over the speed limit. The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour over the speed limit. So, 45 * $2 = $90 will be added to the base fine of $50, making it a total of $90 + $50 = $140. Now, since the fine was doubled because he was in a school zone, the final fine will be 2 * $140 = $280. Additionally, Mark has to pay $300 in court costs and $80/hour for 3 hours of lawyer's work, making it $80 * 3 = $240. Adding all these amounts together, Mark owes $280 + $300 + $240 = $820 for this speeding ticket.

To calculate the total fine, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional fine for speeding based on the overage.
2. Double the base fine because it was done in a school zone.
3. Add the court costs.
4. Add the lawyer's fees.

Step 1: Overage Fine
- The overage is 75 - 30 = 45 mph.
- The cost is $2 per mph over the limit.
- Total additional fine = 45 mph * $2/mph = $90.

Step 2: Double the Base Fine
- Base fine = $50.
- Double the base fine = $50 * 2 = $100.

Step 3: Double the Overage Fine
- Overage fine = $90.
- Double the overage fine = $90 * 2 = $180.

Step 4: Add the Court Costs
- Court costs = $300.

Step 5: Add the Lawyer's Fees
- Lawyer fees = $80/hour * 3 hours = $240.

Now, let's sum up all the amounts:

- Base fine: $50
- Doubling the base fine: $100
- Overage fine doubled: $180
- Court costs: $300
- Lawyer fees: $240

Total fine = $50 + $100 + $180 + $300 + $240 = $870.

To calculate the full amount Mark owes, let's break down the components step-by-step:

1. **Base fine**: $50

2. **Penalty for exceeding the speed limit**: 
   - Speed limit: 30 mph
   - Speed Mark was going: 75 mph
   - Difference: \(75 - 30 = 45\) mph
   - Additional penalty for over speed is $2 per mph, so \(45 \times 2 = 90\) for each mph over the limit.
   - Since the judge doubled the fine for being in a school zone, we need to calculate the penalty based on the maximum over-speed amount.
   - The maximum over-speed applies to the 45 mph penalty for the school zone.
   - Thus, \(45 \times 2 = 90\) penalty for being over the speed limit.

3. **Court costs**: $300

4. **Lawyer fees**: 
   - Lawyer charges: $80/hour
   - Hours worked: 3 hours
   - Total lawyer fees: \(80 \times 3 = 240\)

Now, we sum all these up to get the total amount:

- **Base fine**: $50
- **Penalty for over-speed**: $90
- **Court costs**: $300
- **Lawyer fees**: $240

Total amount: \(50 + 90 + 300 + 240 = 680\)

To determine the total fine for Mark, we need to calculate the increased fine for being over the speed limit and the additional penalty for being in a school zone. Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Calculate the base fine:**
   The base fine for speeding is $50.

2. **Calculate the fine increase for exceeding the speed limit:**
   Mark was going 75 mph in a 30 mph zone. The difference between the speed limit and Mark's speed is:
   \[
   75 - 30 = 45 \text{ mph}
   \]
   The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour over the speed limit. Therefore, the increase in fine is:
   \[
   45 \times 2 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Adding this increase to the base fine, we get:
   \[
   50 + 90 = 140 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Double the fine for being in a school zone:**
   Since Mark was in a school zone, the fine is doubled:
   \[
   140 \times 2 = 280 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Add court costs:**
   The judge also requires Mark to pay $300 in court costs.

5. **Add lawyer's fees:**
   The lawyer charges $80 per hour for three hours of work. Therefore, the lawyer's fee is:
   \[
   80 \times 3 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total fine:**
   Now, we sum up all the components:
   \[
   280 + 300 + 240 = 820 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Mark owes $820 for this speeding ticket.

   - The number of hours over the speed limit is \(75 - 30 = 45\) hours.
   - The fine is increased by $2 for every hour over the limit, so the additional fine is \(45 \times 2 = 90\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total fine is \(50 + 90 = 140\) dollars.

2. **Double the base fine because in a school zone:**
   - The total fine is doubled, so \(140 \times 2 = 280\) dollars.

3. **Court costs:**
   - Court costs are $300.

4. **Cost for the lawyer's work:**
   - The lawyer charges $80 per hour, and Mark needs 3 hours of work.
   - The cost for the lawyer is \(80 \times 3 = 240\) dollars.

5. **Total amount owed:**
