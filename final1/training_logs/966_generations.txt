<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate how much Annabelle spent on junk food. Since she spent a third of her allowance on junk food, we calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Amount spent on junk food} = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10 \]

Next, we add the $8 she spent on sweets:
\[ \text{Total spent} = 10 + 8 = 18 \]

Finally, to find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount spent from her total allowance:
\[ \text{Amount saved} = 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Annabelle saved $12.

First, we need to calculate how much Annabelle spent on junk food. Since she spent a third of her allowance on junk food, we calculate:

\[
\text{Amount spent on junk food} = \frac{1}{3} \times \$30 = \$10
\]

Next, we subtract the amount spent on junk food from her total allowance to find out how much she has left before spending $8 on sweets:

\[
\text{Amount left before sweets} = \$30 - \$10 = \$20
\]

Then, we subtract the $8 spent on sweets from the remaining amount:

\[
\text{Amount left after sweets} = \$20 - \$8 = \$12
\]

So, Annabelle saved \$12.

First, Annabelle spent one third of her weekly allowance on junk food. The amount spent on junk food is calculated as \( \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, she spent an additional \( 8 \) dollars on sweets. The total amount spent on junk food and sweets is \( 10 + 8 = 18 \) dollars.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total spent from her weekly allowance: \( 30 - 18 = 12 \) dollars.

Therefore, Annabelle saved $12.

Annabelle's weekly allowance is $30.

First, to find out how much she spent on junk food, we calculate one third of her allowance: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10 \).

Next, she spent $8 on sweets, which is given directly.

So she spent a total of \( 10 + 8 = 18 \) dollars.

The amount she saved is the total allowance minus the amount spent: \( 30 - 18 = 12 \).

Therefore, Annabelle saved $12.

To determine how much Annabelle saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Annabelle spent on junk food.
2. Subtract the amount spent on junk food and the amount spent on sweets from her total allowance to find out how much she saved.

First, Annabelle earns $30 per week. She spends a third of it on junk food, so she spends:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she spends an additional $8 on sweets. The total amount spent on junk food and sweets is:
\[ 10 + 8 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the total amount spent from her total allowance to find out how much she saved:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Annabelle saved $12.
