To determine how much Roe should save in December to reach a total savings of $150 for the year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the savings from January to July:**
   - Roe saved $10 per month.
   - There are 6 months (January, February, March, April, May, June, July).
   - Total savings from January to July = $10/month × 6 months = $60.

2. **Calculate the savings from August to November:**
   - Roe saved $15 per month.
   - There are 4 months (August, September, October, November).
   - Total savings from August to November = $15/month × 4 months = $60.

3. **Calculate the total savings from January to November:**
   - Total savings from January to November = Savings from January to July + Savings from August to November
   - Total savings from January to November = $60 + $60 = $120.

4. **Determine the amount needed to reach $150:**
   - Desired total savings = $150.
   - Savings needed in December = Desired total savings - Savings from January to November.
   - Savings needed in December = $150 - $120 = $30.

Therefore, Roe should save $30 in December to reach a total savings of $150 for the year.

Reasoning:

First, let's calculate Roe's savings from January to July:
- In January to July, she saved $10 per month.
- Number of months = 7.
- Total savings = $10/month * 7 months = $70.

Next, let's calculate her savings from August to November:
- In August to November, she saved $15 per month.
- Number of months = 4.
- Total savings = $15/month * 4 months = $60.

Now, we need to calculate the total savings from these three periods:
- Total savings = $70 (from January to July) + $60 (from August to November) = $130.

Finally, we need to find out how much she should save in December to reach a total of $150:
- Total savings needed = $150.
- Savings needed in December = $150 - $130 = $20.

So, Roe should save $20 in December.

First, let's calculate the total savings from January to July. Roe saved $10 per month for 7 months, so:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/month} \times 7 \text{ months} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total savings from August to November. Roe saved $15 per month for 4 months, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the savings of January to July and August to November:

\[ 70 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Roe wants her total savings for the year to be $150. So, we need to find out how much she needs to save in December to reach the goal:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars (desired total)} - 130 \text{ dollars (current savings)} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Roe should save $20 in December.

1. Calculate savings from January to July:
   - Roe saves $10 per month for 7 months.
   - Total savings from January to July = $10 × 7 = $70.

2. Calculate savings from August to November:
   - Roe saves $15 per month for 4 months.
   - Total savings from August to November = $15 × 4 = $60.

3. Calculate the total savings from January to November:
   - Total savings from January to November = $70 + $60 = $130.

4. To find out the savings needed in December to reach $150 for the year:
   - Required savings in December = $150 - $130 = $20.

Therefore, Roe should save $20 in December to have a total savings of $150 for the year.

1. **Savings from January to July:**
   - Roe saved $10 per month.
   - There are 7 months from January to July.
   - Total savings from January to July = $10/month × 7 months = $70.

2. **Savings from August to November:**
   - Roe saved $15 per month.
   - There are 4 months from August to November.
   - Total savings from August to November = $15/month × 4 months = $60.

3. **Total savings from January to November:**
   - Total savings = Savings from January to July + Savings from August to November.
   - Total savings = $70 + $60 = $130.

4. **Savings needed in December:**
   - Roe wants a total savings of $150 for the year.
   - To find out how much she needs to save in December, we subtract her total savings from January to November from $150.
   - Savings needed in December = $150 - $130 = $20.

Therefore, Roe should save $20 in December to have a total savings of $150 for the year.

To find out how much Roe should save in December to have a total savings of $150 in the year, we need to first calculate the total amount she has saved so far.

From January to July, she saved $10 per month:
\[10 \text{ dollars/month} \times 7 \text{ months} = 70 \text{ dollars}\]

From August to November, she saved $15 per month:
\[15 \text{ dollars/month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ dollars}\]

Adding these amounts together, her total savings from January to November are:
\[70 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars}\]

To find out how much she needs to save in December to reach a total of $150, we subtract her current savings from the desired total savings:
\[150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Roe should save $20 in December.

Roe's monthly savings are as follows:
- From January to July: $10 per month
- From August to November: $15 per month

Thus for January to July, the total savings can be calculated as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

And for August to November, the total savings can be calculated as follows:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts gives the total savings from January to November:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( x \) be the amount Roe needs to save in December. The total savings for the year should be $150. Therefore, the equation for the total savings is:
\[ 120 + x = 150 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 150 - 120 \]
\[ x = 30 \]

So, Roe should save $30 in December to have a total savings of $150 for the year.

To find out how much Roe should save in December to reach a total savings of $150 in the year, we first need to calculate the total she saved from January to November.

From January to July, Roe saved $10 per month. Since there are 7 months in that period, the total savings from January to July is:
7 months * $10/month = $70

From August to November, Roe saved $15 per month. Again, since there are 4 months in that period, the total savings from August to November is:
4 months * $15/month = $60

Now, we add the savings from January to November to find out the total savings up to November:
$70 (January to July) + $60 (August to November) = $130

Roe wants a total savings of $150 for the year. She has already saved $130, so she needs to save $20 more to reach the desired total.

Therefore, Roe should save $20 in December to have a total savings of $150 in the year.

To find out how much Roe should save in December, we first need to calculate the total amount she has saved by the end of July.

From January to July, she saved $10 per month. There are 7 months in this period. So, her total savings from January to July is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/month} \times 7 \text{ months} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

From August to November, she saved $15 per month. There are 4 months in this period. So, her total savings from August to November is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total savings by the end of November is:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Roe wants a total savings of $150 for the year. Her savings by the end of November are $130. To reach the $150 goal, she needs to save:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Roe should save $20 in December to reach her goal of $150 for the year.

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount Roe saved from January to November.

1. From January to July, Roe saved $10 per month. There are 7 months in this period.
   \[
   7 \text{ months} \times 10 \text{ dollars/month} = 70 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. From August to November, Roe saved $15 per month, which is also a period of 4 months.
   \[
   4 \text{ months} \times 15 \text{ dollars/month} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add the savings from January to November.
\[
70 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars}
\]

Roe aims to have a total savings of $150 for the year. Therefore, to reach this total, she needs to save:
\[
150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Roe needs to save $20 in December to achieve her goal of $150 in the year.

To find out how much Roe should save in December, we need to first calculate her total savings for the first half of the year (January to July) and the second half (August to November).

For January to July:
Roe saved $10 per month for 7 months.
So, the total savings for January to July = 10 * 7 = $70

For August to November:
Roe saved $15 per month for 4 months.
So, the total savings for August to November = 15 * 4 = $60

To find her total savings for the year, we add the savings from January to July and August to November.
So, her total savings for the year = $70 + $60 = $130

To see how much she needs to save in December to reach a total of $150, we subtract her current total savings from this goal.
So, the amount she needs to save in December = $150 - $130 = $20

Therefore, the answer is 20

2. Calculate the total savings from August to November.
3. Add these amounts to find out how much she has saved so far.
4. Determine how much she needs to save in December to reach $150.

Step 1: Calculate the savings from January to July.
January to July is 6 months.
Savings per month = $10
Total savings from January to July = 6 months * $10/month = $60

Step 2: Calculate the savings from August to November.
August to November is 4 months.
Savings per month = $15
Total savings from August to November = 4 months * $15/month = $60

Step 3: Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2.
Total savings = $60 (January to July) + $60 (August to November) = $120

Step 4: Determine how much Roe needs to save in December.
Total desired savings = $150
Savings needed in December = Total desired savings - Savings already made
Savings needed in December = $150 - $120 = $30
