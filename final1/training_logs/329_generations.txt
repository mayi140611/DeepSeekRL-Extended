<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts bought by Samuel and Cathy. Since Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts and Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts is \(2 + 3 = 5\) dozen. Each dozen contains 12 doughnuts, so the total number of doughnuts is \(5 \times 12 = 60\). They plan to share these doughnuts with their 8 other friends, which makes a total of \(1 + 8 = 9\) people. We need to divide the total number of doughnuts by the number of people to find out how many doughnuts each person will receive. This is \(60 \div 9\).

Let's calculate the exact number of doughnuts each will receive.
</reasoning>
<answer>
60 divided by 9 equals 6.666666666666667, which can be rounded to 6.7 for practical purposes if only whole doughnuts are allowed.

Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) doughnuts. Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) doughnuts in total. Together, they have \(24 + 36 = 60\) doughnuts. They will share these doughnuts evenly with their 8 friends, for a total of \(1 + 8 = 9\) people. Therefore, each person will receive \(\frac{60}{9} = 6.\overline{6}\) doughnuts.

Samuel's 2 dozen doughnuts can be converted to 24 dozen. So, the total number of doughnuts they have is 24 + 3 = 27 dozen. They planned to share the doughnuts with 9 people (Samuel + 8 other friends). Hence, each person will receive 27 / 9 = 3 dozen. Converting this back to the number of doughnuts, each person will receive 3 * 12 = 36 doughnuts.

To find out how many doughnuts each person will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of doughnuts bought by Samuel and Cathy.

Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, Samuel has \(2 \times 12 = 24\) doughnuts.

Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts, so she has \(3 \times 12 = 36\) doughnuts.

Together, they have \(24 + 36 = 60\) doughnuts.

They plan to share these doughnuts with 8 other friends, making it a total of \(1 + 8 = 9\) people (including Samuel and Cathy).

To find out how many doughnuts each person will receive, we divide the total number of doughnuts by the total number of people:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ doughnuts}}{9 \text{ people}} = \frac{60}{9} = 6 \text{ doughnuts per person}
\]

To determine how many doughnuts each person will receive, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts purchased and then divide by the total number of people receiving them.

First, let's calculate the total number of doughnuts. Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts, and Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we have:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} + 3 \text{ dozen} = 24 \text{ doughnuts} + 36 \text{ doughnuts} = 60 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people receiving the doughnuts. Samuel and Cathy are sharing the doughnuts with their 8 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 1 + 8 = 11 \text{ people} \]

Now, we divide the total number of doughnuts by the total number of people to find out how many doughnuts each person will receive:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ doughnuts}}{11 \text{ people}} = \frac{60}{11} \approx 5.45 \]

So, each person will receive approximately 5.45 doughnuts. To express this in a more precise form, we can say each person will receive:

\[ \boxed{5 \text{ and } \frac{5}{11} \text{ or } \frac{55}{11}} \]

This means each person will receive 5 full doughnuts plus an additional 5/11 of a doughnut.

To determine how many doughnuts each person will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of doughnuts that Samuel and Cathy bought.

Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, Samuel's doughnuts are calculated as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 24 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts. Therefore, Cathy's doughnuts are:
\[ 3 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 36 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Next, we add the doughnuts bought by Samuel and Cathy to find the total number of doughnuts:
\[ 24 \text{ doughnuts} + 36 \text{ doughnuts} = 60 \text{ doughnuts} \]

They need to share these doughnuts with 8 other friends. This means they will share the doughnuts with 9 people in total (including themselves). To find out how many doughnuts each person will receive, we divide the total number of doughnuts by the total number of people:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ doughnuts}}{9 \text{ people}} = \frac{60}{9} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ doughnuts/person} \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ doughnuts/person} \]

Therefore, each person, including Samuel and Cathy, will receive approximately 6.67 doughnuts.
