system
To determine how many milliliters (mL) of salt Jack will get when all the water evaporates, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of water in the bucket:**
   Jack has collected 2 liters of seawater. Since 1 liter is equal to 1,000 milliliters (mL), we convert liters to milliliters:
   \[
   2 \text{ liters} = 2 \times 1,000 \text{ mL} = 2,000 \text{ mL}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of salt in the seawater:**
   The seawater is 20% salt by volume. Therefore, we calculate 20% of 2,000 mL:
   \[
   \text{Amount of salt} = 20\% \times 2,000 \text{ mL} = 0.20 \times 2,000 \text{ mL} = 400 \text{ mL}
   \]

3. **Recognize that the salt will remain in the concentration it was in:**
   Since the concentration of salt in the seawater remains the same after evaporation, the 400 mL of salt will be left when all the water evaporates.

**Answer: Jack will get 400 mL of salt when all the water evaporates.**

system
First, let's calculate the amount of salt in the 2 liters of seawater. Since the seawater is 20% salt, we can find the amount of salt by multiplying the total volume of the water by the percentage of salt:

\[ \text{Amount of salt} = 2 \text{ liters} \times \frac{20}{100} = 0.4 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from liters to milliliters because the standard volume measurement for salt is in milliliters:

\[ 0.4 \text{ liters} = 0.4 \times 1000 \text{ ml} = 400 \text{ ml} \]

So, when all the water evaporates, Jack will be left with 400 ml of salt.

To determine how many milliliters of salt Jack will get when all the water evaporates, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of salt in the seawater:**
   - The seawater volume is 2 liters.
   - The percentage of salt in the seawater is 20%.

   To find the volume of salt, multiply the total volume by the percentage (expressed as a decimal):

   \[
   \text{Volume of salt} = 2 \, \text{liters} \times 0.20 = 0.4 \, \text{liters}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume of salt to milliliters:**
   - There are 1000 milliliters in a liter.

   To convert liters to milliliters:

   \[
   \text{Volume of salt in ml} = 0.4 \, \text{liters} \times 1000 \, \text{ml/liter} = 400 \, \text{ml}
   \]

Therefore, when all the water evaporates, Jack will get 400 milliliters of salt.

First, let's calculate the total amount of salt in the seawater in milliliters (ml). Since there are 1000 ml in a liter, and Jack has 2 liters of seawater, the total amount of salt in ml is:

\[ 2 \text{ liters} \times 1000 \text{ ml/liter} = 2000 \text{ ml} \]

20% of this total volume is the salt. So, to find 20% of 2000 ml:

\[ 2000 \text{ ml} \times 0.20 = 400 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, when all the water evaporates, Jack will get 400 ml of salt.

To solve this, we need to calculate the amount of salt in 2 liters of water. First, convert liters to milliliters since the answer is in milliliters. 1 liter = 1000 milliliters, so 2 liters = 2000 milliliters. Now, calculate the amount of salt in the seawater. The seawater contains 20% salt, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 milliliters. 

Let's do the calculation:

20% of 2000 milliliters = 0.20 x 2000
                  = 400 milliliters

Therefore, when all the water evaporates, Jack will get 400 ml of salt.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####


system
First, let's calculate how much salt is currently in the 2 liters of seawater. Since the water is 20% salt, we can calculate the amount of salt as follows:

Salt percentage = 20% = 0.20 in decimal form

Amount of salt = 0.20 * 2 liters * 1000 ml/liter = 400 ml salt

When Jack evaporates all the water, the salt will remain in the remaining 80% of the liquid because water evaporates and leaves only the salt. So, we calculate the remaining percentage as:

Percentage remaining = 100% - 20% = 80%

Amount of salt left when all water evaporates = 80% * 400 ml = 0.80 * 400 ml = 320 ml salt

Therefore, Jack will get 320 ml of salt when all the water evaporates.

To determine how much salt Jack will get when all the water evaporates, we need to calculate 20% of the 2 liters of seawater.

1. Jack has 2 liters of seawater.
2. 20% of 2 liters is calculated as \(0.20 \times 2 = 0.4\) liters.
3. Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, 0.4 liters is equal to \(0.4 \times 1000 = 400\) milliliters.

Thus, when all the water evaporates, Jack will have 400 ml of salt.

To find out how many ml of salt Jack will get, first we need to calculate the amount of salt in the seawater collected by Jack.

We can use the following formula to calculate the amount of salt:

\[ \text{Amount of salt} = \text{Volume of water} \times \text{Percentage salt (in decimal form)} \]

Jack has collected 2 liters of seawater, and the water is 20% salt. We know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 ml, so 2 liters is equal to 2000 ml. Therefore, we can convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[ 20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2 \]

Now we can calculate the amount of salt:

\[ \text{Amount of salt} = 2000 \, \text{ml} \times 0.2 = 400 \, \text{ml} \]

So, when all the water evaporates, Jack will get 400 ml of salt.

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the percentage of salt in a solution (which is exactly what this seawater is) tells us how much of the whole volume is salt. Here, since the water is 20% salt, it means that out of every 100 ml of seawater, 20 ml is salt.

So, if Jack collected 2 liters (which is 2000 ml) of seawater, the amount of salt he will get when all the water evaporates can be calculated as follows:

2000 ml of seawater * 20% salt = 400 ml of salt.

Therefore, when all the water evaporates, Jack will get 400 ml of salt.
