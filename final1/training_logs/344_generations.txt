###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Archie is playing with his marbles outside. He loses 60% of them into the street. Of the remaining ones, he loses half down a sewer. If he has 20 left, how many did he start with?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the total number of marbles Archie started with as \( x \).

1. Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street. Therefore, he retains 40% of his marbles.
   \[
   0.40x = \text{remaining marbles}
   \]

2. Out of these remaining marbles, he loses half down a sewer. Hence, he retains 50% of the remaining marbles.
   \[
   0.50 \times 0.40x = \text{remaining marbles after losing half into the sewer}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   0.20x = \text{remaining marbles after losing half into the sewer}
   \]

3. It is given that after these losses, Archie has 20 marbles left.
   \[
   \text{remaining marbles after losing half into the sewer} = 20
   \]

4. From the equation \( 0.20x = 20 \), we solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{0.20} = \frac{20}{\frac{2}{10}} = 20 \times \frac{10}{2} = 100
   \]

So, the total number of marbles Archie started with is 100.

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Archie had as \( x \).

1. Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street, so he has 40% of his marbles remaining, which is \( 0.4x \).

2. Of the remaining 40%, he loses half down a sewer, so he has half of his remaining marbles left, which is \( 0.2 \times 0.4x = 0.08x \).

3. We know that after these losses, he has 20 marbles left, so \( 0.08x = 20 \).

4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 0.08x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{0.08} \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, Archie started with 250 marbles.

Let \( x \) represent the total number of marbles Archie initially had.

First, assume he lost 60% of his marbles into the street. This means he retains 40% of his marbles:
\[ (0.40)x \]

Next, he loses half of the remaining marbles down a sewer. This implies he retains the other half of what he had after losing into the street:
\[ (0.5 \times 0.40)x = 0.20x \]

We know that after all these losses, he has 20 marbles left:
\[ 0.20x = 20 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{0.20} = 100 \]

Therefore, Archie started with 100 marbles.

Let's denote the number of marbles Archie started with as \( x \).

2. Then, he loses half of the remaining marbles down the sewer. So, he is left with 50% of the marbles he has after losing 60% into the street, which is \( 0.5 \times 0.4x = 0.2x \).

3. We are given that he ends up with 20 marbles. So we can set up the equation: 
\[ 0.2x = 20 \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{0.2} = 100 \]

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Archie had as \( x \).

First, Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street. This means he is left with 40% of his initial marbles. So, the number of marbles left after losing 60% into the street is:
\[ 0.4x \]

Next, he loses half of the remaining marbles down the sewer. So, the number of marbles left after losing half of the remaining marbles is:
\[ \frac{0.4x}{2} = 0.2x \]

We know that after all this loss, Archie has 20 marbles left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.2x = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 0.2:
\[ x = \frac{20}{0.2} = 100 \]

So, Archie initially had 100 marbles.

Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street, so he has 40% remaining. Let's denote the number of marbles he started with as \( x \). Then, after losing 60% into the street, he has \( 40\% \) of \( x \), which he then loses half down the sewer. So, the number of marbles left after losing to the sewer is \( \frac{40\% \times x}{2} \). We know that after losing the 60% into the street and then half of that amount down the sewer, Archie has 20 marbles left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ 40\% \times x = 20 \times 2 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 0.40 \times x = 40 \]

\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} \]

\[ x = 100 \]

So Archie started with 100 marbles.

Let's denote the total number of marbles Archie started with as \( x \).

First, he loses 60% of his marbles into the street. So the number of marbles lost is \( 0.6x \). Therefore, the number of marbles left after losing some into the street is:
\[ x - 0.6x = 0.4x \]

Next, he loses half of the remaining marbles down a sewer. The number of marbles he loses in the sewer is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 0.4x = 0.2x \). The number of marbles left after losing some down the sewer is:
\[ 0.4x - 0.2x = 0.2x \]

According to the problem, after all these events, Archie has 20 marbles left. So we have:
\[ 0.2x = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{20}{0.2} = 100 \]

Let's denote the original number of marbles Archie had as \( x \).

First, he loses 60% of his marbles into the street. So, 40% of his marbles remain. We can express this mathematically as \( 0.4x \).

Then, he loses half of the remaining marbles down a sewer. So, he is left with half of \( 0.4x \), which is \( 0.2 \times 0.4x = 0.08x \).

We know that after losing half of his remaining marbles, he has 20 left. Therefore, \( 0.08x = 20 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{20}{0.08} \]

Let's calculate \( x \).

\[ x = \frac{20}{0.08} = 250 \]

To find out how many marbles Archie started with, we will work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that after losing half of his remaining marbles, he has 20 left. This means that before losing half, he had:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ marbles} \]

This is because losing half means keeping the other half, so we multiply by 2.

Next, we know that Archie lost 60% of his original amount of marbles onto the street. If we let \( x \) be the original number of marbles, then 60% of \( x \) equals the number of marbles lost onto the street. So, 40 marbles represent 60% of his original amount. We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.60x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.60:

\[ x = \frac{40}{0.60} = \frac{400}{6} = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67 \]

Since the number of marbles must be a whole number, and typically such problems are designed with whole number solutions, we would round this to the nearest whole number, but it is often assumed in such problems that it should be exact in such contexts, so we interpret it as:

\[ x = 67 \]

Therefore, Archie started with 67 marbles.

Let's denote the number of marbles Archie started with as \( x \).

1. Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street. So, the remaining marbles after loss are 40% of \( x \), which is \( 0.4x \).
2. After losing the marbles down the sewer, he has half of the remaining \( 0.4x \), which is \( 0.5 \times 0.4x = 0.2x \) left.
3. According to the problem, after these losses, he has 20 marbles left. Therefore, \( 0.2x = 20 \).

Let's solve the equation to find \( x \):
