#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Initially, Baez has 25 marbles.

She loses 20% of them, which is 0.20 * 25 = 5 marbles.

After losing the marbles, Baez has 25 - 5 = 20 marbles.

Her friend then gives her double the amount that Baez has after losing the marbles, which is 2 * 20 = 40 marbles.

After receiving the marbles from her friend, Baez has 20 + 40 = 60 marbles.

Therefore, Baez ends up with 60 marbles.

Baez starts with 25 marbles. She loses 20% of them, which is \(25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5\) marbles. So, she has \(25 - 5 = 20\) marbles left.

Her friend then gives her double the amount she has left, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) marbles. Adding these to the 20 marbles she already had, Baez ends up with \(20 + 40 = 60\) marbles.

Baez loses 20% of her 25 marbles, that is 0.20 x 25 = 5 marbles.
After she loses them, she has 25 - 5 = 20 marbles left.

#### GENERATION 11 RESPONSE ####


system
Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how many marbles Baez loses, then calculate how many marbles she has after losing the marbles, and finally calculate how many marbles she has after her friend gives her double the amount she has after losing the marbles.

Solution:
Baez loses 20% of her marbles, which is 20/100 * 25 = 5 marbles. 
After losing 5 marbles, Baez has 25 - 5 = 20 marbles.
A friend then gives her double the amount that Baez has after she lost the marbles, which is 2 * 20 = 40 marbles.
Baez ends up with 20 + 40 = 60 marbles.

Answer:
Baez ends up with 60 marbles.
