###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take.  His first route option includes 3 stoplights.  This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?

If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take an additional 3 minutes per light, so it will take \(3 \times 3 = 9\) minutes longer. Adding this to the original 10 minutes, the total trip time will be \(10 + 9 = 19\) minutes. Since the second route takes 14 minutes, the difference in trip time between the first and second routes is \(19 - 14 = 5\) minutes.

To calculate the additional time if all three stoplights are red, we first need to determine the time difference between all green and all red lights. Each red stoplight adds 3 minutes to the trip. With all 3 stoplights red, the increase in time is \(3 \text{ minutes/light} \times 3 \text{ lights} = 9 \text{ minutes}\).

Since the first route is 10 minutes long when all lights are green, and the second route is 14 minutes, the difference is \(14 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\). This difference corresponds to the increase in minutes due to red lights.

So, if all stoplights are red, the additional time spent waiting at red stoplights is \(9 \text{ minutes}\) less than the difference in time, which is \(4 \text{ minutes}\) minus \(5 \text{ minutes}\) (since \(9 \text{ minutes}\) must be less than or equal to the difference).

Therefore, the answer is \(5 \text{ minutes}\).

If all three stoplights are red, the first route will take 3 red lights * 3 minutes each = 9 extra minutes.
If the trip normally takes 10 minutes and becomes 9 minutes longer if all three stoplights are red, then it will take a total of 10 + 9 = 19 minutes.
So the first route will take 19 - 14 = 5 minutes longer than the second route.

If all three stoplights are red, each will add 3 minutes to the trip. Therefore, for all three stoplights, the additional time will be \(3 \times 3 = 9\) minutes.

So, the first route will take a total of \(10 + 9 = 19\) minutes if all three stoplights are red.

For the second route, the trip takes 14 minutes directly, regardless of the traffic lights.

The difference in time between the first route and the second route will be \(19 - 14 = 5\) minutes.

To determine how much longer the trip will be if all three stoplights are red, we need to calculate the total time for each route and then find the difference.

For the first route with stoplights:
- If all three lights are green, the trip takes 10 minutes.
- If any one light is red, the trip will add 3 minutes to the total time.
- If all three lights are red, the trip will take 10 minutes + 3 minutes + 3 minutes + 3 minutes.

Let's calculate the total time:

For all three lights red:
\[ 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

The second route is a constant 14 minutes.

The difference in time between the first and second route is:
\[ 19 - 14 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

So, if all three stoplights are red, the trip will be 5 minutes longer than the second route.

The second route takes 14 minutes, regardless of the conditions at the stoplights.

The difference in trip time between the first route and the second route is \(19 - 14 = 5\) minutes.

To determine how much longer the man's trip is if all three stoplights are red, we need to calculate the total time for the first route.

First, we note that the first route includes 3 stoplights and the time follows a pattern: 10 minutes for all green lights, adding 3 minutes for each red light.

If all 3 stoplights are red, the time will be:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} \times 3 = 10 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}. \]

The second route is a direct route that takes 14 minutes. The difference in time between the first route and the second route is:
\[ 19 \text{ minutes} - 14 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes}. \]

Therefore, if all 3 stoplights are red, the trip will be 5 minutes longer on the first route compared to the second route.

To determine how much longer the trip will be if all three stoplights are red, we need to calculate the time taken by the first route assuming all lights are red.

1. **Base time of the first route if all lights are green:** 10 minutes.

2. **Time increase per red light:** 3 minutes per red light.

3. **Number of red lights:** 3 stoplights.

4. **Total time increase due to red lights:** 
   \[
   3 \text{ red lights} \times 3 \text{ minutes per red light} = 9 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Total time for the first route with all red lights:** 
   \[
   10 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Time for the second route:** 14 minutes (given).

7. **Difference in time between the two routes:** 
   \[
   19 \text{ minutes} - 14 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, if all three stoplights are red, the trip will be 5 minutes longer.

To determine how much longer the man's trip will be if all three stoplights are red, we need to calculate the total time for each route and identify the difference.

1. **First Route with Red Stoplights:**
   - The trip normally takes 10 minutes.
   - Each red light adds 3 minutes to the trip.
   - If all three stoplights are red, the additional time is \(3 \text{ minutes/light} \times 3 \text{ lights} = 9 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Therefore, the total time for the first route if all stoplights are red is \(10 + 9 = 19 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Second Route:**
   - The second route takes 14 minutes without any stoplights.

3. **Difference in Time:**
   - The difference in time between the first route with red stoplights and the second route is \(19 - 14 = 5 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, if the man chooses the first route and all three stoplights are red, his trip will be 5 minutes longer.

In the scenario where all three stoplights are red, the man's trip will take \(3 \times 3 = 9\) more minutes due to the stoplights. He initially needs 10 minutes for the three green lights. Thus, his total trip time will be \(10 + 9 = 19\) minutes. The second route takes 14 minutes. 

Therefore, his trip is \(19 - 14 = 5\) minutes longer if all three stoplights are red.

To determine how much longer the trip will be if all three stoplights are red, we start by noting the trip time for the first route when all lights are green: 10 minutes. Each red light adds 3 minutes to the trip. Therefore, if all 3 stoplights are red, the additional time added is \(3 \text{ minutes} \times 3 \text{ lights} = 9 \text{ minutes}\).

Adding this extra time to the initial trip time of 10 minutes gives us the total time for the route with all red lights:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

The second route takes 14 minutes. To find out how much longer the first route is compared to the second route, we subtract the time of the second route from the first route:
\[ 19 \text{ minutes} - 14 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, if the man chooses the first route and all 3 stoplights are red, the trip will be 5 minutes longer compared to the second route.

To determine how much longer the man's trip will be if all three stoplights are red, we first need to calculate the time it would take for the first route under the condition where all three stoplights are red.

The first route normally takes 10 minutes. If each of the 3 stoplights is red, it adds 3 minutes to the trip for each red light. Since all three stoplights are red, the total additional time for the red lights is:
\[3 \text{ red lights} \times 3 \text{ minutes per red light} = 9 \text{ minutes}\]

Adding this to the normal 10-minute trip, we get:
\[10 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}\]

The second route takes 14 minutes, which is already calculated and does not require any additional time if all lights are green.

Therefore, the difference in time between the first route with all red lights and the second route is:
\[19 \text{ minutes} - 14 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes}\]

Thus, the trip would be 5 minutes longer if all three stoplights are red.

If all three stoplights are red on the first route, each one will add 3 minutes to the trip, so a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) minutes extra. 

The first route takes 10 minutes when all lights are green, so adding the extra 9 minutes gives a total trip time of \(10 + 9 = 19\) minutes.

The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.

Therefore, the first route will be 19 - 14 = 5 minutes longer than the second route.
