For strawberries:
- Martha needs 4 cups of strawberries for 1 quart of ice cream.
- The cost of 2 cup packages of strawberries is $3.00 each.

Let's calculate the cost per quart:
- For the strawberry quart, since there are 2 cups per package and each package costs $3.00, the cost per cup is $1.50.
- For 4 cups, it would be $1.50 * 2 = $3.00.

For raspberries:
- Martha needs 2 cups of raspberries for 1 quart of ice cream.
- The cost of 2 cup packages of raspberries is $5.00 each.

For heavy cream:
- The cost of a 4 cup container is $4.00.

Now let's add up the costs:
- Strawberry ice cream: $3.00
- Raspberry ice cream: $5.00
- Heavy cream: $4.00

Total cost = $3.00 + $5.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Therefore, the total cost for Martha to make 1 quart of each ice cream is $12.00.

First, let's calculate the cost for the strawberries and raspberries needed to make 1 quart each of strawberry and raspberry ice cream.

For strawberries:
- 1 quart requires 4 cups.
- 2 cups = $3.00.
- To get 4 cups, Martha needs to buy 2 packages of strawberries (since 2 cups per package).
- Cost per quart of strawberries = (2 packages / 1 quart) * $3.00 = $6.00.

For raspberries:
- 1 quart requires 4 cups.
- 2 cups = $5.00.
- To get 4 cups, Martha needs to buy 2 packages of raspberries.
- Cost per quart of raspberries = (2 packages / 1 quart) * $5.00 = $10.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the heavy cream.

For heavy cream:
- 1 quart requires 2 cups.
- 4 cups = $4.00.
- As Martha will need 2 cups for each quart of ice cream, she will require 2 containers of heavy cream.
- Cost for 2 containers of heavy cream = 2 containers * $4.00 per container = $8.00.

Finally, let's sum up the total cost for all ingredients needed to make 1 quart of each ice cream:

Total cost for strawberries = $6.00
Total cost for raspberries = $10.00
Total cost for heavy cream = $8.00

Total cost to make 1 quart of each ice cream = $6.00 + $10.00 + $8.00 = $24.00.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the berries for both ice creams.

For 1 quart of strawberry ice cream:
- She needs 4 cups of strawberries, which cost $3.00 per package.
- For 1 quart, she will need 2 packages.
Therefore, the cost for strawberries is 2 * $3.00.

For 1 quart of raspberry ice cream:
- She needs 4 cups of raspberries, which cost $5.00 per package.
- For 1 quart, she will need 2 packages.
Therefore, the cost for raspberries is 2 * $5.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the heavy cream for both ice creams.

For 1 quart of strawberry ice cream:
- She needs 1 quart of heavy cream, which costs $4.00.

Thus, the total cost for 1 quart of each ice cream is the sum of the cost of the strawberries, raspberries, and heavy cream.

<answer>
(2 * $3.00) + (2 * $5.00) + $4.00

First, calculate the total amount of berries needed for 1 quart of each ice cream. Since Martha needs 4 cups of berries for 1 quart of ice cream, for 2 quarts (strawberry and raspberry) she will need:

2 quarts * 4 cups/quart = 8 cups of berries

Martha needs 2 cups of berries for 1 quart of ice cream, so for 2 quarts, she needs:

2 quarts * 2 cups/quart = 4 cups of berries

Now, calculate the total cost of the berries. Strawberries are $3.00 each and she needs 8 cups, so:

8 cups * $3.00/cup = $24.00

Raspberries are $5.00 each and she needs 4 cups, so:

4 cups * $5.00/cup = $20.00

Next, calculate the cost of the heavy cream. Heavy cream is $4.00 for a 4 cup container, and she needs enough for 2 quarts, making it 4 cups, so:

4 cups * $4.00/container = $16.00

Finally, add the costs together:

Strawberries: $24.00
Raspberries: $20.00
Heavy cream: $16.00

Total cost: $24.00 + $20.00 + $16.00 = $60.00

Therefore, the total cost for Martha to make 1 quart of each ice cream is $60.00.

Martha needs 4 cups of strawberries for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 2 cups of strawberries for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream. Therefore, she will need 4 + 2 = 6 cups of strawberries.

Martha will need 4 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart of ice cream. Therefore, she will need 4 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 4 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.

The cost of strawberries is $3.00 per 2 cup package, so for 6 cups, she will need 6 / 2 = 3 packages. The cost will be 3 packages * $3.00 = $9.00.

The cost of heavy cream is $4.00 for a 4 cup container, so for 4 cups, she will need 1 container. The cost will be 1 container * $4.00 = $4.00.

The total cost to make 1 quart of each ice cream is the sum of the cost of strawberries and heavy cream, which is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

To determine the cost for Martha to make 1 quart of strawberry and raspberry ice cream, we need to calculate the cost of the berries and heavy cream required for each quart.

First, let's calculate the cost for making 1 quart of strawberry ice cream:
- Martha needs 4 cups of berries to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream.
- The cost of 2 cups of strawberries is $3.00, so the cost of 4 cups (1 quart) is:
  \[
  4 \text{ cups / 2 \text{ cups/package}} \times \$3.00 = \$6.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for making 1 quart of raspberry ice cream:
- Martha needs 4 cups of berries to make 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.
- The cost of 2 cups of raspberries is $5.00, so the cost of 4 cups (1 quart) is:
  \[
  4 \text{ cups / 2 \text{ cups/package}} \times \$5.00 = \$10.00
  \]

Now, let's add the costs of the berries for both quarts:
- The total cost for the strawberries is $6.00 (for 1 quart) + $6.00 (for 1 quart) = $12.00
- The total cost for the raspberries is $10.00 (for 1 quart) + $10.00 (for 1 quart) = $20.00

Finally, we add the cost of heavy cream, which is $4.00 for a 4 cup container:
- The total cost is $12.00 (for strawberries) + $20.00 (for raspberries) + $4.00 (for heavy cream) = $36.00

Thus, the total cost for Martha to make 1 quart of each ice cream is $36.00.

To determine the total cost for Martha to make 1 quart each of strawberry and raspberry ice cream, we need to calculate the cost of berries and heavy cream separately and then sum them.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for strawberries.**
- Martha needs 2 cups of strawberries to make 1 quart of ice cream.
- Each 2 cup package of strawberries costs $3.00.
- Since Martha needs 2 cups for 1 quart, she will need 2 packages for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for raspberries.**
- Martha needs 1 cup of raspberries to make 1 quart of ice cream.
- Each 2 cup package of raspberries costs $5.00.
- Since she only needs 1 cup for 1 quart, she will need 2 packages for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for heavy cream.**
- Martha needs 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream.
- Each 4 cup container of heavy cream costs $4.00.
- To find out how many 4 cup containers are needed for 2 cups, we divide 2 by 4: \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) containers.
- Therefore, she will need 1 container for the strawberry ice cream and 1 container for the raspberry ice cream.

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost.**
- Cost of strawberries: \( 2 \text{ packages} \times \$3.00 = \$6.00 \)
- Cost of raspberries: \( 2 \text{ packages} \times \$5.00 = \$10.00 \)
- Cost of heavy cream: \( 1 \text{ container} \times \$4.00 = \$4.00 \)

**Step 5: Sum up the total cost.**
- Total cost = Cost of strawberries + Cost of raspberries + Cost of heavy cream
- Total cost = \( \$6.00 + \$10.00 + \$4.00 = \$20.00 \)

**Answer:** 
It will cost Martha $20.00 to make 1 quart of each ice cream.

First, let's calculate the cost of the berries for each quart of ice cream. Martha needs 4 cups of strawberries and 4 cups of raspberries to make one quart of strawberry ice cream and one quart of raspberry ice cream. At the farmers market, the 2 cup packages of strawberries are $3.00 each, and the 2 cup package of raspberries are $5.00 each.

So, for the strawberries, she needs 4 cups which means she needs 2 packages (since 4 divided by 2 equals 2). Each package costs $3.00, so the total for strawberries will be:

2 packages * $3.00/package = $6.00

For the raspberries, she needs 4 cups which means she needs 2 packages (since 4 divided by 2 equals 2). Each package costs $5.00, so the total for raspberries will be:

2 packages * $5.00/package = $10.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the heavy cream. Martha needs 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream. At the farmers market, the heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4 cup container. Since it's for 2 cups, we need to find out how many quart containers that would be. Since 4 cups equals 1 quart, 2 cups is half a quart. The heavy cream is priced for a whole quart container, so she would need a full quart which would cost her $4.00.

Now we add up all the costs:
- Berries: $6.00 + $10.00 = $16.00
- Heavy cream: $4.00

Total cost for 1 quart of each ice cream is:
$16.00 (berries) + $4.00 (heavy cream) = $20.00

So, it will cost her $20.00 to make 1 quart of strawberry and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.

To determine the cost of making 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, we need to calculate the cost of the berries and the heavy cream separately for each type of ice cream.

For strawberry ice cream:
- Martha needs 4 cups of strawberries for 1 quart.
- Each 2-cup package of strawberries costs $3.00.
- Therefore, she needs 2 packages of strawberries (since 4 cups divided by 2 cups per package equals 2 packages).

Cost of strawberries for one quart of strawberry ice cream:
\[ 2 \text{ packages} \times \$3.00 \text{ per package} = \$6.00 \]

- Martha needs 2 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart.
- The heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4-cup container.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 cups is \(\frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups}} \times \$4.00 = \$2.00\).

So, the total cost for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream is:
\[ \$6.00 \text{ (strawberries)} + \$2.00 \text{ (heavy cream)} = \$8.00 \]

For raspberry ice cream:
- The process is similar to the strawberry ice cream, so Martha needs 2 packages of raspberries (since 4 cups divided by 2 cups per package equals 2 packages).
- Each 2-cup package of raspberries costs $5.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 packages of raspberries is:
\[ 2 \text{ packages} \times \$5.00 \text{ per package} = \$10.00 \]

- Martha needs 2 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart.
- The heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4-cup container.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 cups is $\frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups}} \times \$4.00 = \$4.00$.

So, the total cost for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream is:
\[ \$10.00 \text{ (raspberries)} + \$4.00 \text{ (heavy cream)} = \$14.00 \]

Now, adding the costs for both ice creams:
\[ \$8.00 \text{ (strawberry)} + \$14.00 \text{ (raspberry)} = \$22.00 \]
