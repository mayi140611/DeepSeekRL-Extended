Let's denote the initial amount of money Isabel had by \( x \) dollars.

1. After spending half of the initial amount on a toy, the remaining amount is:
\[ \frac{x}{2} \]

2. She then spends half of the remaining amount on a book. The amount spent on the book is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \]

3. The remaining amount after buying the toy and the book is:
\[ \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} \]

We know that she has $51 left, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = 51 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{2x - x}{4} = 51 \]
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 51 \]

Now, we multiply both sides by 4:
\[ x = 51 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 204 \]

So, Isabel initially had $204.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Isabel had as \( x \).

1. Isabel spent half of her money on a toy, so she had \( \frac{x}{2} \) left.
2. She then spent half of the remaining money on a book, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \), leaving her with \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \).

We are told that after these expenditures, she has $51 left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 51
\]
To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 51 \times 4
\]
\[
x = 204
\]

Thus, Isabel initially had $204 in her piggy bank.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the final amount left**: Isabel has $51 in her piggy bank after spending money on her toy and a book.
2. **Determine the amount she spent on her brother's book**: When she spent half of the remaining money after buying the toy, she had $51 left. This means the half she spent on the book is $51. Therefore, the total amount before buying the book is $51 * 2 = $102.
3. **Determine the amount she spent on her toy**: She spent half of the initial amount on the toy. So, the amount spent on the toy is $102 / 2 = $51. 
4. **Calculate the initial amount**: The sum of the amounts spent on the toy and the book is $51. Therefore, the initial amount is $102 - $51 = $51.

But, we need to correct our calculation because we need to start with the initial amount and derive the amount she had before buying the toy. When she spent half of the initial amount on the toy, she had $51 left. So, the initial amount she had was twice this amount, i.e., $51 * 2 = $102.

So, finally, the amount of money she had initially must be $102 - $51 = $51 / 0.5 (after buying the toy, half the initial amount is spent).

But we need to re-evaluate our logic because we realized the mistake in the final steps. When she spent half of the initial amount on the toy, the remaining half plus $51 equals the initial amount. The final calculation should be:
- After buying the toy, she had $51 left, so the initial amount was $51 * 2 = $102.
- Then she spent half of the remaining $51 (after buying the toy) on the book, so the amount spent on the book is $51 (the remaining after buying the toy).

This means the initial amount must have been $102 + $51 (before she buys the book after buying the toy) = $153.

So, the initial amount of money Isabel had is $153.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Isabel had as \( x \).

1. She spent half of her initial money on a toy, so she spent \( \frac{x}{2} \). The remaining money is \( x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \).
2. She then spent half of the remaining money on her brother's book, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \). The remaining money now is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \).
3. According to the problem, after these expenditures, she has $51 left. So we have \( \frac{x}{4} = 51 \).

We can solve this equation to find \( x \):
\[ x = 51 \times 4 \]

Let's compute the value of \( x \).

2. Then she spends half of the remaining money on a book, so she has \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{8} \) left.

We know that after these expenses, Isabel has $51 left. This gives us the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{8} = 51
\]

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 8:
\[
x = 51 \cdot 8

   - Isabel spent half of her initial amount on a toy.
   - Remaining money after buying the toy: \( \frac{x}{2} \).

2. **Second Purchase of the Book:**
   - Isabel then spent half of the remaining money (which is \( \frac{x}{2} \)) on a book for her brother.

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of money Isabel has left after her purchases. We know that she has $51 left after buying the book. Let's denote her initial amount of money as \( x \).

1. After buying the book, Isabel had $51 left. The amount she spent on the book is half of the remaining amount after buying the toy, which means she spent \( \frac{x}{2} \) on the book.
2. Therefore, the amount she had before buying the book is \( 51 + \frac{x}{2} \).
3. After buying the toy, she had \( 51 + \frac{x}{2} \) left. The amount she spent on the toy is half of the remaining amount after buying the book, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{2} \left(51 + \frac{x}{2}\right) \).
4. Therefore, the amount she had before buying the toy is \( 51 + \frac{1}{2} \left(51 + \frac{x}{2}\right) \).
5. Since we know she had \( x \) initial amount, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 51 + \frac{1}{2} \left(51 + \frac{x}{2}\right) \]

Now we need to solve this equation to find \( x \).
