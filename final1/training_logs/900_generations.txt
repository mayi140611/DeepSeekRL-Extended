<reasoning>
First, we need to determine the amount of key lime juice Audrey uses. Since she doubles the recipe, she will use \(2 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\) cup of key lime juice. Next, we need to convert this amount into tablespoons since each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice. Since there are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup, \(\frac{1}{2}\) cup is equal to \(\frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8\) tablespoons of juice. Each key lime yields 1 tablespoon, so Audrey needs 8 key limes.

To find out how many key limes Audrey needs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of key lime juice needed: Since Audrey doubles the recipe, she needs \(1/4 \times 2 = 1/2\) cup of key lime juice.
2. Convert the amount of juice to tablespoons: Since there are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup, 1/2 cup of juice is \(16 \times 1/2 = 8\) tablespoons of juice.
3. Determine how many key limes are needed: Each key lime provides 1 tablespoon of juice, so Audrey needs 8 key limes to get 8 tablespoons of juice.

Therefore, Audrey needs 8 key limes.

First, we need to determine the total amount of key lime juice Audrey wants to use. Since the recipe calls for 1/4 cup and she likes to double this amount, she will use \(1 \times 2 = 2\) cups of juice. Next, we convert the total juice needed from cups to tablespoons because each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice. Since there are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup, 2 cups of juice would be \(2 \times 16 = 32\) tablespoons of juice.

Given that each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice, Audrey needs \(32\) key limes.

Therefore, the answer is 32 key limes.

Audrey wants to double the amount of key lime juice called for in the recipe, so she needs 1/4 * 2 = 1/2 cup of key lime juice. 
Since each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice, she will need 1/2 cup * 16 tablespoons/cup = 8 tablespoons of juice.
Since each key lime yields 1 tablespoon, Audrey will need 8 key limes.

To determine how many key limes Audrey needs, we first calculate the amount of key lime juice she uses. Since she doubles the recipe, she starts with 1/4 cup of key lime juice, which is equivalent to:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup} \times 2 = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup} \]

Next, we convert the amount of juice from cups to tablespoons. Since there are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup, we have:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup} \times 16 \text{ tablespoons/cup} = 8 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice. Therefore, to get 8 tablespoons of juice, Audrey needs:

\[ 8 \text{ tablespoons} \div 1 \text{ tablespoon/key lime} = 8 \text{ key limes} \]

So, Audrey needs 8 key limes.

First, let's calculate the total amount of key lime juice Audrey needs to use to make her pie extra tart. Since the original recipe calls for 1/4 cup of key lime juice and she likes to double this amount, we first convert 1/4 cup into tablespoons and then double it. Additionally, we know that each key lime produces 1 tablespoon of juice.

1. Convert 1/4 cup to tablespoons:
   - There are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup.
   - Therefore, 1/4 cup is equal to \( \frac{16}{4} = 4 \) tablespoons.

2. Double the amount of juice:
   - Since the original recipe calls for 4 tablespoons, and Audrey wants to double this amount, she needs \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) tablespoons.

3. Determine the number of key limes needed:
   - Each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice.
   - Therefore, to get 8 tablespoons of juice, Audrey needs 8 key limes.

Multiplying the amount of juice needed per recipe by the number of servings of her recipe, we find:
\( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) tablespoons.

Thus, Audrey needs 16 key limes.

1. First, calculate the total amount of key lime juice Audrey wants to use. She doubles the original amount:
   \[
   \text{Original amount} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Doubling the amount} = 2 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup}

2. Convert the total amount from cups to tablespoons. Since there are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup:
   \[
   \text{Total tablespoons} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup} \times 16 \text{ tablespoons/cup} = 8 \text{ tablespoons}

3. Each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice. Therefore, the number of key limes needed is equal to the total number of tablespoons:
   \[
   \text{Number of key limes} = 8 \text{ tablespoons}

4. However, the question asks for the number of key limes needed. Since each key lime can produce 1 tablespoon of juice and Audrey wants to use 8 tablespoons of juice:
