###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Timothy has $50 to spend at a souvenir shop. He sees some t-shirts that cost $8 each, key chains that sell 3 pieces for $2, and bags that cost $10 each. Timothy buys 2 t-shirts and 2 bags. How many pieces of key chains can he buy with the amount of money he has left?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
First, let's calculate the total cost of the t-shirts and bags that Timothy buys:

Cost of t-shirts = 2 t-shirts * $8/t-shirt = $16
Cost of bags = 2 bags * $10/bag = $20

Total spent on t-shirts and bags = $16 + $20 = $36

Timothy has $50 to spend, so he has $50 - $36 = $14 left.

Next, we need to calculate how many key chains Timothy can buy with the remaining $14. 

Cost of 3 key chains = $2
Number of sets of 3 key chains he can buy = $14 / $2 = 7 sets

Total number of key chains = 7 sets * 3 key chains/set = 21

Now, Timothy can buy 21 key chains with the amount of money he has left.

Timothy spends 2 * $8 = $16 on t-shirts.
He spends 2 * $10 = $20 on bags.
Thus, he spends $16 + $20 = $36 on t-shirts and bags.
Timothy has $50 - $36 = $14 left to buy key chains.
Since key chains cost 3 pieces for $2, he can buy $14 / $2 * 3 = 7 * 3 = 21 pieces of key chains.

Timothy spends 2 t-shirts x $8 = $16 on t-shirts.
He spends 2 bags x $10 = $20 on bags.
He spends a total of $16 + $20 + total cost of key chains = $50.
The total cost of the key chains is $50 - ($16 + $20) = $14.
Timothy can buy $14/$2 = 7 key chains.

Timothy spends on t-shirts: \(2 \times \$8 = \$16\)

He spends on bags: \(2 \times \$10 = \$20\)

Total spent on t-shirts and bags: \(\$16 + \$20 = \$36\)

Timothy starts with \$50, so he has \$50 - \$36 = \$14 left.

With the remaining \$14, he can buy key chains that sell 3 pieces for \$2. To find out how many key chains he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost per set of 3 key chains: \(\$14 \div 2 = 7\) sets.

Since each set consists of 3 pieces, Timothy can buy \(7 \times 3 = 21\) pieces of key chains.

Timothy spends money on 2 t-shirts which cost $8 each, so he spends 2 * $8 = $16 on t-shirts.
Timothy also spends money on 2 bags which cost $10 each, so he spends 2 * $10 = $20 on bags.
In total, Timothy spends $16 (on t-shirts) + $20 (on bags) = $36.
Timothy started with $50, so he has $50 - $36 = $14 left.

Key chains cost 3 pieces for $2, so the price for 1 piece is $2 / 3.

Timothy can buy $14 / ($2 / 3) = 14 / (2/3) = 14 * (3/2) = 42 / 2 = 21 pieces of key chains.

Timothy spends $8 per t-shirt, so for 2 t-shirts, he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. He also spends $10 for each bag, so for 2 bags, he spends \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars. In total, he spends \(16 + 20 = 36\) dollars on t-shirts and bags.

He started with $50, so the money left for key chains is \(50 - 36 = 14\) dollars. Since key chains cost 3 for $2, each key chain costs \(2/3\) dollars. Therefore, the number of key chains he can buy with $14 is \(\frac{14}{\frac{2}{3}} = 14 \times \frac{3}{2} = 21\).

Timothy spends $8 per t-shirt, so for 2 t-shirts he spends \(2 \times 8 = \$16\).

Timothy spends $10 per bag, so for 2 bags he spends \(2 \times 10 = \$20\).

In total, he spends \(16 + 20 = \$36\) on t-shirts and bags.

He started with $50, so the remaining amount he can spend on key chains is \(50 - 36 = \$14\).

Key chains are sold 3 pieces for $2, so the amount he can buy per piece is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a key chain.

He spends $14, so he can buy \(\frac{14}{\frac{2}{3}} = 14 \times \frac{3}{2} = 21\) key chains.

Timothy spends $8 on each t-shirt, so for 2 t-shirts, he spends 2 * $8 = $16.
Timothy spends $10 on each bag, so for 2 bags, he spends 2 * $10 = $20.
Thus far, he has spent $16 + $20 = $36.
He started with $50, so he has $50 - $36 = $14 left.
Key chains are sold 3 pieces for $2, so he can buy $14 / $2 per 3 pieces = $7 / 3 = $2.33 per 3 pieces.
Thus, he can buy 2 * $2.33 = 4 pieces of key chains.
