###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

To determine the number of passengers on the bus after each stop, we'll account for the people getting on and off at each station.

- Initially, the bus starts with \(0\) passengers.
- At the first stop, 7 people get on. So, the number of passengers becomes \(0 + 7 = 7\).
- At the second stop, 3 people get off and 5 people get on. The net change is \(5 - 3 = 2\) passengers. So, the number of passengers now is \(7 + 2 = 9\).
- At the third stop, 2 people get off and 4 people get on. The net change is \(4 - 2 = 2\) passengers. So, the number of passengers now is \(9 + 2 = 11\).

Therefore, the bus now has 11 passengers.

First, let's calculate the number of passengers after the first stop. The bus started with an unknown number of passengers, let's call this number \( x \). After the first stop, 7 people got on, so the total number of passengers became \( x + 7 \).

Next, at the second stop, 3 people got off and 5 people got on. This means the number of passengers decreased by 3 and increased by 5, resulting in the total number of passengers becoming \( x + 7 - 3 + 5 = x + 9 \).

At the third stop, 2 people got off and 4 people got on. This results in the number of passengers decreasing by 2 and increasing by 4, making the total number of passengers \( x + 9 - 2 + 4 = x + 11 \).

So the number of passengers now on the bus is \( x + 11 \).

Since the problem doesn't specify the initial number of passengers, we can't determine a specific number of passengers. But we can express the current number of passengers in terms of the initial number \( x \).

Therefore, the number of passengers on the bus now is \( x + 11 \).

x + 11

To find out how many passengers are now on the bus, we need to track the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

1. Initially, the bus starts with 0 passengers.
2. At the first stop, 7 people get on. So, the number of passengers becomes \(0 + 7 = 7\).
3. At the second stop, 3 people get off, and 5 people get on. So, the number of passengers becomes \(7 - 3 + 5 = 9\).
4. At the third stop, 2 people get off, and 4 people get on. So, the number of passengers becomes \(9 - 2 + 4 = 11\).

Therefore, there are now 11 passengers on the bus.

To find out how many passengers are now on the bus, we need to track the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

1. **Initial start of the route:** The bus starts with an unknown number of passengers. We'll call this number \( P_0 \).

2. **First stop:** 
   - People got on: 7
   - People got off: \( P_0 \)
   - Net gain: 7 - \( P_0 \)
   - New total: \( 7 - P_0 \)

3. **Second stop:** 
   - People got off: 3
   - People got on: 5
   - Net gain: 5 - 3 = 2
   - New total: \( (7 - P_0) + 2 = 9 - P_0 \)

4. **Third stop:** 
   - People got off: 2
   - People got on: 4
   - Net gain: 4 - 2 = 2
   - New total: \( (9 - P_0) + 2 = 11 - P_0 \)

Assuming \( P_0 \) is a positive number, the final count of passengers on the bus will be \( 11 - P_0 \).

Without knowing the initial number of passengers \( P_0 \), we can't determine a specific final number of passengers. However, the formula to calculate the final number of passengers is \( 11 - P_0 \).

To find out the current number of passengers on the bus, we need to calculate the net change in the number of passengers at each stop and then add up the changes.

- At the first stop: 7 people got on. The number of passengers now is 7.

- At the second stop: 3 people got off, and 5 people got on. The net change is 5 - 3 = 2. The number of passengers now is 7 + 2 = 9.

- At the third stop: 2 people got off, and 4 people got on. The net change is 4 - 2 = 2. The number of passengers now is 9 + 2 = 11.

First, we calculate the number of passengers after the first stop:
Starting passengers + people who got on = 7 + 5 = 12 passengers.

Next, we account for the passengers who got off at the second stop and those who got on:
12 - 3 + 5 = 14 passengers.

Then, we make the final adjustment for the passengers who got off at the third stop and those who got on:
14 - 2 + 4 = 16 passengers.

Therefore, there are 16 passengers currently on the bus.

We can calculate the number of passengers on the bus after each stop by keeping track of the changes in the number of passengers.

At the first stop, 7 people got on, so the number of passengers is:
\[ \text{Initial number of passengers} + 7 = \text{Passengers at first stop} \]

At the second stop, 3 people got off and 5 people got on, so the number of passengers is:
\[ \text{Passengers at first stop} - 3 + 5 = \text{Passengers after second stop} \]

At the third stop, 2 people got off and 4 people got on, so the number of passengers is:
\[ \text{Passengers after second stop} - 2 + 4 = \text{Passengers after third stop} \]

Now, we need to calculate the actual numerical value for each step.
