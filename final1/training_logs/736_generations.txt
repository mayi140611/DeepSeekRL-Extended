Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Barry bought 12 pretzels, so \( B = 12 \).

Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry, so Shelly bought \( \frac{1}{2} B = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pretzels. So \( S = 6 \).

Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly did, so Angie bought \( 3S = 3 \times 6 = 18 \) pretzels.

Let's denote the number of pretzels each person bought as follows:
- B: Barry's pretzels
- S: Shelly's pretzels
- A: Angie's pretzels

From the problem, we know that:
1. Barry bought 12 pretzels, so \( B = 12 \).
2. Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry, so \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times B = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \).
3. Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly, so \( A = 3 \times S = 3 \times 6 = 18 \).

Therefore, Angie bought 18 pretzels.

To find out how many pretzels Angie bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pretzels Shelly bought.
2. Use the information about Angie's purchase in relation to Shelly's purchase to find out how many Angie bought.

From the given information:
- Barry bought 12 pretzels.
- Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry.
- Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly.

Let's start by calculating how many pretzels Shelly bought:
\[
\text{Shelly's pretzels} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Barry's pretzels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
\]

Now, we know:
\[
\text{Angie's pretzels} = 3 \times \text{Shelly's pretzels} = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

So, Angie bought 18 pretzels.

2. Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry. Therefore, Shelly bought \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pretzels.
3. Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly. Thus, Angie bought \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) pretzels.

Let's denote the number of pretzels Shelly bought as \( S \), the number Barry bought as \( B \), and the number Angie bought as \( A \).

According to the information given:
1. Barry bought 12 pretzels, so \( B = 12 \).
2. Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry, so \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times B \).
3. Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly, so \( A = 3 \times S \).

Let's calculate the values step by step:
1. \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times B = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \).
2. \( A = 3 \times S = 3 \times 6 = 18 \).

So, Angie bought 18 pretzels.

Let's denote the number of pretzels Shelly bought as \( S \). According to the information given, Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry, and Barry bought 12 pretzels. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \]

So, Shelly bought 6 pretzels.

Next, we are told that Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly. Therefore, the number of pretzels Angie bought, denoted as \( A \), is:
\[ A = 3 \times S = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Thus, Angie bought 18 pretzels.

Let's denote the number of pretzels Barry bought as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 12 \).

Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry. So, if we denote the number of pretzels Shelly bought as \( S \), then we have:
\[ S = \frac{1}{2}B \]

Since \( B = 12 \):
\[ S = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \]

Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly. Let \( A \) represent the number of pretzels Angie bought. We can write:
\[ A = 3S \]
Substituting the value obtained for \( S \):
\[ A = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

So, Angie bought 18 pretzels.
