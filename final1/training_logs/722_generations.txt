We know that in 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old. This means he is currently 25 - 10 = 15 years old.

We also know that Jed is 10 years older than Matt. This means that Matt is currently 15 - 10 = 5 years old.

The sum of their present ages is 15 + 5 = 20 years.

Let's denote Jed's current age as \( J \) and Matt's current age as \( M \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Jed is 10 years older than Matt: \( J = M + 10 \)
2. In 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old: \( J + 10 = 25 \)

First, we can solve the second equation for Jed's current age:
\[ J + 10 = 25 \]
\[ J = 25 - 10 \]
\[ J = 15 \]

Now that we know Jed's current age, we can use the first equation to find Matt's current age:
\[ M + 10 = J \]
\[ M + 10 = 15 \]
\[ M = 15 - 10 \]
\[ M = 5 \]

So, Jed is currently 15 years old and Matt is currently 5 years old.

The sum of their present ages is:
\[ J + M = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

<reasoning>
We know from the problem that Jed is 10 years older than Matt. Let's denote Matt's current age as \( M \) and Jed's current age as \( J \). Therefore, we have:
\[ J = M + 10 \]

We also know that in 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old. Given that Jed's age in 10 years will be \( J + 10 \), we can write:
\[ J + 10 = 25 \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 15 = M + 10 \]
\[ M = 15 - 10 = 5 \]

Thus, Matt's current age is 5 years, and Jed's current age is 15 years.

To find the sum of their present ages, we add their current ages:
\[ M + J = 5 + 15 = 20 \]

Therefore, the sum of Jed and Matt's current ages is 20.

To find Jed's current age, we start by determining Jed's age in 10 years, which is 25 years. Since Jed will be 25 years old in 10 years, his current age must be:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

Jed is 10 years older than Matt, so Matt's current age must be:
\[ 15 - 10 = 5 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find the sum of their present ages, we add Jed's age and Matt's age together:
\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the sum of their present ages is 20 years.

To determine the sum of Jed and Matt's present ages, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Jed's present age:**
   - Jed will be 25 years old in 10 years.
   - Therefore, Jed's current age is \( 25 - 10 = 15 \) years old.

2. **Determine Matt's current age:**
   - Jed is 10 years older than Matt.
   - So, Matt's current age is \( 15 - 10 = 5 \) years old.

3. **Calculate the sum of their present ages:**
   - Jed's age = 15 years
   - Matt's age = 5 years
   - Sum of their ages = \( 15 + 5 = 20 \) years.

Let's denote the current age of Matt as \( M \).

According to the problem, Jed is 10 years older than Matt:
\[ \text{Jed's age} = \text{Matt's age} + 10 \]
\[ \text{Jed's age} = M + 10 \]

In 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old:
\[ \text{Jed's age in 10 years} = \text{Jed's current age} + 10 = 25 \]
\[ (M + 10) + 10 = 25 \]
\[ M + 20 = 25 \]
\[ M = 25 - 20 \]
\[ M = 5 \]

So, Matt is currently 5 years old.

Since Jed is 10 years older than Matt:
\[ \text{Jed's current age} = M + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 \]

The sum of their present ages is:
\[ \text{Matt's age} + \text{Jed's age} = 5 + 15 = 20 \]

Let's denote Jed's current age as \( J \) and Matt's current age as \( M \).

We know three pieces of information:
1. Jed is 10 years older than Matt. So, \( J = M + 10 \).
2. In 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old. So, \( J + 10 = 25 \).

From the second point, we can solve for \( J \):
\[ J + 10 = 25 \]
\[ J = 25 - 10 \]
\[ J = 15 \]

So, Jed's current age is 15, and since Jed is 10 years older than Matt:
\[ M = J - 10 \]
\[ M = 15 - 10 \]
\[ M = 5 \]

Therefore, Matt's current age is 5. The sum of their current ages is:
\[ J + M = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Let's denote Matt's current age as \( M \) years. Since Jed is 10 years older than Matt, Jed's current age would be \( M + 10 \) years. In 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old, so we can set up the equation \( M + 10 + 10 = 25 \).

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M + 20 = 25 \]
\[ M = 25 - 20 \]
\[ M = 5 \]

So, Matt is currently 5 years old. Jed is \( 5 + 10 = 15 \) years old.

Let's denote Jed's current age as J and Matt's current age as M.

From the information given, we have two equations:

1. Jed is 10 years older than Matt:
   J = M + 10

2. In 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old:
   J + 10 = 25

To find the present ages, we need to solve these equations. From the second equation, we can solve for J:
   J + 10 = 25
   J = 25 - 10
   J = 15

Now that we know Jed's current age is 15, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find Matt's age:
   15 = M + 10
   M = 15 - 10
   M = 5

So, Jed's present age is 15 and Matt's present age is 5.

The sum of their present ages is:
   J + M = 15 + 5 = 20

Let's denote the present age of Matt by $x$.

Jed is 10 years older than Matt, which means Jed's present age would be $x + 10$.

In 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old, so we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 10) + 10 = 25 \]

Solving this equation for $x$:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Matt's present age is 5 years old.

Now, let's calculate the sum of their present ages:
\[ \text{Matt's age} + \text{Jed's age} = 5 + (5 + 10) = 5 + 15 = 20 \]

The answer is 20.

We need to find the present ages of Jed and Matt. Let's denote Jed's present age as \( J \) and Matt's present age as \( M \).

1. Jed is 10 years older than Matt: \( J = M + 10 \)
2. In 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old: \( J + 10 = 25 \)

\[ M = 15 - 10 \]
\[ M = 5 \]

So, the present age of Jed is 15 and the present age of Matt is 5.
