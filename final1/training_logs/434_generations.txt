###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Maria wants to buy a brand new bike. The retail price at the bike shop stands at $600. She saved $120 toward the purchase. As this was not enough, she asked her mother to give her the remaining amount. Her mother offered her $250 and told her that she needs to earn the rest working during the holidays. How much money must Maria earn to be able to buy the bike she wants?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Maria has already saved $120, and her mother is giving her an additional $250. We can calculate the remaining amount she needs by subtracting her savings and her mother's contribution from the retail price of the bike.

Retail price of the bike = $600
Amount saved by Maria = $120
Amount given by Maria's mother = $250

Total amount available = Retail price of the bike + Amount saved by Maria + Amount given by Maria's mother

Let's calculate it:

Total amount available = $600 + $120 + $250 = $970

Now, to find out how much Maria needs to earn, we subtract the total amount she has from the retail price of the bike:

Remaining amount to earn = Retail price of the bike - Total amount available

Let's do the calculation:

Remaining amount to earn = $600 - $970 = -$370

However, Maria has already exceeded the retail price of the bike, so she does not need to earn any money; she is already able to buy the bike.

Maria has saved $120 and her mother will give her $250, so the total amount she has currently is $120 + $250 = $370.

The retail price of the bike is $600. To find out how much more money Maria needs, we subtract the amount she has from the retail price:

$600 - $370 = $230.

Therefore, Maria must earn $230 to be able to buy the bike she wants.

Maria initially saved $120. Her mother offered her $250. The total amount Maria has is the sum of these two amounts:
$120 + $250 = $370

The retail price of the bike is $600. To find out how much Maria needs to earn, we subtract the amount she already has from the retail price:
$600 - $370 = $230

Therefore, Maria must earn $230.

Maria has already saved $120. Her mother will give her $250. So, the total amount of money she has now is:

\[ 120 + 250 = 370 \]

The retail price of the bike is $600. So, the amount of money Maria still needs to earn is:

\[ 600 - 370 = 230 \]

Therefore, Maria must earn $230 to be able to buy the bike she wants.

To find out how much money Maria needs to earn, we start by determining how much money she still needs after her mother's contribution.

First, we calculate the total cost of the bike:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$600 \]

Next, we subtract the money Maria already saved:
\[ \text{Amount saved by Maria} = \$120 \]

Now, we calculate how much money Maria needs to earn by subtracting the amount saved from the total cost:
\[ \text{Remaining amount Maria needs to earn} = \text{Total cost} - \ \text{Amount saved by Maria} \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount Maria needs to earn} = \$600 - \$120 = \$480 \]

Thus, Maria must earn \$480 to be able to buy the bike she wants.

Maria has already saved $120. Her mother offered her an additional $250. So, the total amount she needs to earn is $600 (retail price) minus the money she has saved and the money her mother gave her.

To determine how much money Maria must earn, we start by calculating the total cost of the bike and the amount she has already saved, including the money her mother offered.

The retail price of the bike is $600. Maria has saved $120, and her mother gave her $250. We can calculate the remaining amount she needs to earn by subtracting the total amount she has saved and received from the retail price:

\[ 600 - 120 - 250 = 230 \]

So, Maria needs to earn $230 to be able to buy the bike.

To find out how much money Maria needs to earn, we first calculate how much more she needs to save:

Retail price of the bike - amount Maria saved = Amount she needs to save
$600 - $120 = $480

Then we subtract the amount her mother offered her from the remaining amount needed:

Amount Maria needs to save - amount her mother offered = Amount Maria needs to earn
$480 - $250 = $230

So, Maria must earn $230 to be able to buy the bike.

To determine how much money Maria needs to earn, we start by identifying the total cost of the bike and the amount Maria has already saved.

The retail price of the bike is $600, and Maria has saved $120 herself. The amount still needed can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Amount needed} = \text{Total cost of the bike} - \text{Amount saved} = 600 - 120 = 480 \]

This means that after her mother gives her $250, Maria still needs to earn an additional amount to cover the remaining $480.

\[ \text{Amount to earn} = \text{Amount needed} - \text{Amount from mother} = 480 - 250 = 230 \]

Therefore, Maria must earn $230.

To determine how much more money Maria needs to earn to buy the bike, we start by calculating the total amount Maria has and the remaining amount required.

1. The retail price of the bike is $600.
2. Maria has already saved $120.
3. Her mother gave her $250.

First, calculate the total amount Maria has after receiving the money from her mother:

\[
\text{Total amount Maria has} = \text{Money saved} + \text{Money from mother}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount Maria has} = 120 + 250 = 370
\]

Next, subtract the amount Maria has from the retail price of the bike to find the remaining amount she needs:

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = \text{Retail price} - \text{Total amount Maria has}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 600 - 370 = 230
\]

Therefore, Maria needs to earn $230 to be able to buy the bike.

Maria initially saved $120. Her mother offered her an additional $250. The total amount needed for the bike is $600. The amount Maria still needs to earn is calculated by subtracting the total savings and the additional money from the bike's price.

Amount needed for the bike = $600
Total savings and additional money = $120 + $250

Amount Maria still needs to earn = $600 - ($120 + $250).

Subtracting the amount from the total savings and additional money from the bike price gives:

Amount Maria still needs to earn = $600 - ($120 + $250)
Amount Maria still needs to earn = $600 - $370
Amount Maria still needs to earn = $230.
