system
Derek initially has $960. He spends half of it on textbooks, so he spends $960 / 2 = $480 on textbooks. After buying textbooks, he has $960 - $480 = $480 left. He then spends a quarter of the remaining money on school supplies, which is $480 / 4 = $120. This leaves him with $480 - $120 = $360.
