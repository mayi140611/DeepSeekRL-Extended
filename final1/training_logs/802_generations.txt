To determine the total amount Donna paid for the porcelain vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sale price after the 25% discount.
2. Calculate the total price including the 10% sales tax on the sale price.

First, the sale price after a 25% discount can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} - (\text{Original Price} \times 0.25) = 200 - (200 \times 0.25) \]

Then, the total price including the 10% sales tax is:
\[ \text{Total Price} = \text{Sale Price} + (\text{Sale Price} \times 0.10) \]

Now, let's perform the calculations.
</reasoning>
<answer>
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 200 - (200 \times 0.25) = 200 - 50 = 150 \]
\[ \text{Total Price} = 150 + (150 \times 0.10) = 150 + 15 = 165 \]

Therefore, the total amount Donna paid is \$165.

First, we need to calculate the sale price of the porcelain vase after the 25% discount. The original price is $200, so the discount is 25% of $200, which is $200 * 0.25 = $50. The sale price is then $200 - $50 = $150.

Next, we calculate the total amount including the 10% sales tax. The sales tax is 10% of the sale price, which is $150 * 0.10 = $15. The total amount Donna paid is the sale price plus the sales tax, which is $150 + $15 = $165.

Therefore, Donna paid a total of $165.

To calculate the total amount Donna paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount: The porcelain vase went on sale for 25% off, so the discount is 25% of the original price.
2. Calculate the discounted price: Subtract the discount amount from the original price.
3. Calculate the sales tax: Apply the 10% sales tax to the discounted price.
4. Calculate the total amount paid: Add the sales tax to the discounted price.

Let's do the math:

1. Discount amount = 25% of $200 = (25/100) * $200 = $50.
2. Discounted price = $200 - $50 = $150.
3. Sales tax = 10% of $150 = (10/100) * $150 = $15.
4. Total amount paid = $150 + $15 = $165.

Therefore, Donna paid $165 in total.

To determine the total amount Donna paid for the porcelain vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sale price of the vase after the 25% discount.
2. Calculate the amount Donna paid with the 10% sales tax applied to the sale price.

First, the original price of the vase is $200. With a 25% discount, the sale price is reduced by 25%. The sale price can be found by subtracting 25% of $200 from $200.

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 200 - 0.25 \times 200 = 200 - 50 = 150 \]

Next, Donna paid 10% sales tax on the sale price of $150.

\[ \text{Sales Tax} = 0.10 \times 150 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total amount Donna paid is the sale price plus the sales tax.

\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = 150 + 15 = 165 \]

So, Donna paid a total of $165 for the porcelain vase.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sale price of the porcelain vase after a 25% discount.
2. Calculate the total price including a 10% sales tax.

First, the sale price is calculated by taking 75% of the original price ($200), since a 25% discount means 75% of the original price is paid.

\[ \text{Sale price} = 200 \times (1 - 0.25) = 200 \times 0.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total price with a 10% sales tax on the sale price.

\[ \text{Total price including tax} = \text{Sale price} \times (1 + 0.10) \]

Let's plug in the values:

\[ \text{Sale price} = 200 \times 0.75 = 150 \]

\[ \text{Total price including tax} = 150 \times (1 + 0.10) = 150 \times 1.10 \]

\[ \text{Total price including tax} = 165 \]

So, Donna paid $165 in total.

The porcelain vase was on sale for 25% off, so the discount amount is 25% of $200, which is $50. This means the vase was sold at $200 - $50 = $150. Donna then paid 10% sales tax on the $150 price. The sales tax amount is 10% of $150, which is $15. Therefore, Donna paid a total of $150 + $15 = $165.

To determine the final price Donna paid for the porcelain vase, we first need to calculate the discounted price. The original price of the vase is $200, and it is on sale for 25% off.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 200 \times \frac{25}{100} = 200 \times 0.25 = 50 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale price} = 200 - 50 = 150 \]

Next, Donna pays 10% sales tax on the sale price. The sales tax amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Sales tax} = 150 \times \frac{10}{100} = 150 \times 0.10 = 15 \]

Finally, to find the total amount Donna paid, we add the sale price and the sales tax:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 150 + 15 = 165 \]

So, Donna paid a total of $165 for the porcelain vase.

Donna bought the porcelain vase which was originally priced at $200. The vase went on sale for 25% off, so the discount amount is 25% of $200, which is \( 200 \times \frac{25}{100} = 50 \) dollars. The sale price of the vase is \( 200 - 50 = 150 \) dollars.

Next, Donna paid 10% sales tax on the sale price of $150. The sales tax amount is \( 150 \times \frac{10}{100} = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Donna paid is \( 150 + 15 = 165 \) dollars.

To determine the total amount Donna paid for the porcelain vase after the discount and sales tax, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount.
2. Find the sale price after the discount.
3. Calculate the sales tax.
4. Add the sales tax to the sale price to get the total amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount.
The original price of the vase is $200, and it is on sale for 25% off.
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 200 \times \frac{25}{100} = 200 \times 0.25 = 50 \]

Step 2: Find the sale price after the discount.
\[ \text{Sale price} = 200 - 50 = 150 \]

Step 3: Calculate the sales tax.
The sales tax rate is 10%.
\[ \text{Sales tax} = 150 \times \frac{10}{100} = 150 \times 0.10 = 15 \]

Step 4: Add the sales tax to the sale price to get the total amount paid.
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 150 + 15 = 165 \]

Therefore, the total amount Donna paid for the porcelain vase is $165.

First, we need to calculate the sale price of the porcelain vase after the 25% discount. The original price is $200, and 25% off means the vase is now worth 75% of its original price. We can find the sale price by multiplying $200 by 0.75.

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 200 \times 0.75 = 150 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Donna paid after adding the 10% sales tax to the sale price.

\[ \text{Tax Amount} = 150 \times 0.10 = 15 \]

Adding the tax to the sale price will give us the total amount Donna paid.

\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = 150 + 15 = 165 \]

So Donna paid $165 in total.

To calculate the final price Donna paid for the porcelain vase including sales tax, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sale price by applying the 25% discount to the original price.
2. Calculate the total cost after applying the sales tax to the sale price.

Step 1: Calculate the sale price:
\[ \text{Sales Price} = \text{Original Price} - (\text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Sales Price} = \$200 - (\$200 \times 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Sales Price} = \$200 - \$50 \]
\[ \text{Sales Price} = \$150 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost after sales tax:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Sales Price} + (\text{Sales Price} \times \text{Sales Tax Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$150 + (\$150 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$150 + \$15 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$165 \]

Therefore, Donna paid a total of $165 for the porcelain vase.

To determine how much Donna paid in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price after the 25% off sale.
2. Calculate the total price including the 10% sales tax on the discounted price.

First, the original price of the porcelain vase is $200. A 25% discount means she will pay 75% of the original price. We calculate the discounted price as follows:
\[ 200 \times (1 - 0.25) = 200 \times 0.75 = 150 \]
So, the discounted price of the porcelain vase is $150.

Next, we need to find out how much she pays after adding 10% sales tax. A 10% sales tax on $150 is:
\[ 150 \times (1 + 0.10) = 150 \times 1.10 = 165 \]
So, Donna paid $165 in total.

The amount Donna paid in total is $165.
