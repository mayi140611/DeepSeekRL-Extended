First, we need to calculate the total length of rope needed. Since each story is 10 feet and Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories, the total length of rope needed is:

\[ 6 \text{ stories} \times 10 \text{ feet/story} = 60 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to consider the losing percentage when lashing the ropes together. Each 20-foot rope loses 25% when lashed together, meaning it retains only 75% of its length due to the lashing.

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 0.75 = 15 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we divide the total length of the rope needed by the length of the usable rope (15 feet) to find out how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ feet}}{15 \text{ feet}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tom will need to buy 4 pieces of rope.

To lower a rope down 6 stories, Tom needs a total length of \(6 \times 10 = 60\) feet.

Initially, there are 20 feet of rope per piece, but when lashing them together, 25% of the total length is lost. So, we need to account for this loss. 

First, let's calculate how much rope is available per piece after the loss:

\[20 \text{ feet} - (25\% \times 20 \text{ feet}) = 20 \text{ feet} - 5 \text{ feet} = 15 \text{ feet}\]

Now, we can determine how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy:

\[\frac{60 \text{ feet}}{15 \text{ feet per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}\]

Therefore, Tom will need to buy 4 pieces of rope.

To determine how many pieces of rope Tom will need to buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of rope needed. Since Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories and each story is 10 feet, the total length required is:
\[ 6 \text{ stories} \times 10 \text{ feet/story} = 60 \text{ feet} \]

2. Determine the length of rope after accounting for the 25% loss when lashing them together. The original length of one piece of rope is 20 feet. Losing 25% means retaining 75% of the original length:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 0.75 = 15 \text{ feet} \]

3. Calculate how many pieces of the 15-foot rope are needed to make up the 60-foot total. Since each piece of rope is 15 feet, the number of pieces required is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ feet}}{15 \text{ feet/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tom will need to buy 4 pieces of rope.

To determine how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total length of rope needed:**
   - One story is 10 feet.
   - Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories.
   - Total length required: \( 6 \text{ stories} \times 10 \text{ feet/story} = 60 \text{ feet} \).

2. **Determine the length of rope lost when lashing them together:**
   - When lashing ropes, you lose 25% of the total length.
   - To find the usable length after lashing, multiply the total length by 75% (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

3. **Calculate the usable length after lashing:**
   - Usable length: \( 60 \text{ feet} \times 0.75 = 45 \text{ feet} \).

4. **Determine the number of pieces needed:**
   - Each piece of rope is 20 feet long.
   - Number of pieces needed: \( \frac{45 \text{ feet}}{20 \text{ feet/piece}} = 2.25 \text{ pieces} \).

5. **Round up to ensure the rope is long enough:**
   - Since you can't buy a fraction of a piece, Tom needs to buy 3 pieces of rope to have enough length. 

6. **Verify the total length with 3 pieces:**
   - With 3 pieces of 20 feet each: \( 3 \text{ pieces} \times 20 \text{ feet/piece} = 60 \text{ feet} \), which is exactly what is needed.

Thus, Tom needs to buy 3 pieces of rope.

To find out how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy, we first need to determine the total length of rope he needs, which is 10 feet per story for 6 stories. 

Total length of rope required = 10 feet/story x 6 stories = 60 feet

The rope is sold in pieces that are 20 feet each, but when lashing them together, you lose 25%. So the effective usable length of one piece of rope is 75% of its original length.

Effective usable length per piece = 20 feet x 75% = 20 feet x 0.75 = 15 feet

Now, to find out how many pieces he needs to buy, we divide the total length of rope required by the effective usable length per piece.

Number of pieces needed = Total length of rope required / Effective usable length per piece
Number of pieces needed = 60 feet / 15 feet per piece = 4 pieces

So, Tom will need to buy 4 pieces of rope to get enough length for 6 stories.

To find out how much rope Tom needs, we first need to calculate the total length of rope required for 6 stories. 

One story is 10 feet, so for 6 stories:

Total feet needed = Story length * Number of stories
Total feet needed = 10 feet/story * 6 stories
Total feet needed = 60 feet

Now, let's find out how much rope he will lose when lashing them together. He loses 25%, so he will lose 0.25 of the rope:

25% of 20 feet = 0.25 * 20 feet
25% of 20 feet = 5 feet

So, Tom will need to buy enough rope to cover 60 feet, but he will only have 20 - 5 feet to be able to lash them together easily.

Rope needed = Total feet needed - Loss due to lashing
Rope needed = 60 feet - 5 feet
Rope needed = 55 feet

Now, we need to divide the total feet needed by the length of one piece of rope to find out how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy:

Number of pieces = Rope needed / Length of one piece
Number of pieces = 55 feet / 20 feet/piece
Number of pieces = 2.75

Since Tom cannot buy a fraction of a piece of rope, he will need to buy 3 pieces of rope.

To determine how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy, let's break down the problem:

1. **Total height to be lowered**: 
   - Each story is 10 feet tall.
   - Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories.
   - Therefore, the total height is \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \) feet.

2. **Length of each rope piece**:
   - The rope is available in 20-foot pieces.
   - Each piece loses 25% when lashed together, meaning it retains only 75% of its true length.

3. **Weightage of retained length**:
   - If each piece retains 75% of its true length, then the effective length per piece is \( 20 \times 0.75 = 15 \) feet.

4. **Number of rope pieces needed**:
   - To find out how many pieces are needed to span 60 feet at 15 feet per piece, divide the total required length by the effective length per piece:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ feet}}{15 \text{ feet per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
     \]

So, Tom will need to buy 4 pieces of rope.

To determine how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy to lower the rope down 6 stories, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of rope needed:
   - Each story is 10 feet.
   - Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories.
   - Total length per story = 10 feet
   - Total length needed = 6 stories × 10 feet/story = 60 feet

2. Determine the effective length of a piece of rope after lashing them together:
   - Each piece of rope is 20 feet long.
   - When lashing 2 pieces together, you lose 25% of the total length.
   - When lashing 2 pieces together, the total length = 2 pieces × 20 feet/piece = 40 feet
   - After lashing, you save 25% of 40 feet = 0.25 × 40 feet = 10 feet
   - Effective length per piece after lashing = 40 feet - 10 feet = 30 feet

3. Calculate how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy:
   - Divide the total length needed by the effective length per piece after lashing.
   - Number of pieces needed = Total length needed ÷ Effective length per piece = 60 feet ÷ 30 feet/piece = 2 pieces

Therefore, Tom will need to buy 2 pieces of rope.

To determine how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of rope required: 
   One story is 10 feet, and there are 6 stories, so:
   \(10 \text{ feet/story} \times 6 \text{ stories} = 60 \text{ feet}\)

2. Determine the length of rope used when lashing:
   When lashing, 25% of the rope is lost, so, effectively, you're using only 75% of the rope:
   \(60 \text{ feet} \times 0.75 = 45 \text{ feet}\)

3. Calculate how many 20-foot pieces are needed:
   To find out how many pieces are necessary to have 45 feet, divide the total by the length of each piece:
   \(45 \text{ feet} / 20 \text{ feet/piece} = 2.25\)

Since Tom can't buy a fraction of a rope, he will need to round up to the next whole number.

To lower a rope down 6 stories, Tom requires \(6 \times 10 = 60\) feet of rope.

When the two pieces are lashed together, the effective length is reduced by 25%, meaning the new length is \(75\%\) of the original length. So, the effective length from the two pieces is \(20 \times 0.75 = 15\) feet.

To find out how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy, we divide the total length required by the effective length of the two pieces. So, he needs \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \) pieces of rope.
