system
Initially, there are 336 books in the library. On Monday, 124 books are taken out, so the number of books decreases by 124:

\[ 336 - 124 = 212 \]

On Tuesday, 22 books are returned, so the number of books increases by 22:

\[ 212 + 22 = 234 \]

So, there are now 234 books in the library.

We start with the initial number of books in the library: 336 books.

On Monday, 124 books are taken out:
\[ 336 - 124 = 212 \]
So, after taking out 124 books, there are 212 books left.

On Tuesday, 22 books are brought back:
\[ 212 + 22 = 234 \]
So, after bringing back 22 books, there are 234 books in the library.

Let's calculate the initial number of books after Monday's events:
Initial number of books = 336
Books taken out on Monday = 124
Books returned on Tuesday = 22

Subtracting the books taken out from the initial number:
336 - 124 = 212 books

Adding the books returned:
212 + 22 = 234 books

So, after Monday and Tuesday's events, there are 234 books in the library.

To find out how many books are left in the library, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of books, which is 336.
2. Subtract the number of books taken out on Monday, which is 124.
3. Add the number of books brought back on Tuesday, which is 22.

So the calculation would be: \(336 - 124 + 22\).

Calculating the difference and then adding the number of books brought back gives us:

\(336 - 124 = 212\)

\(212 + 22 = 234\)

Therefore, after these transactions, there are 234 books in the library.

To find out how many books are in the library now, we start with the initial number of books, which is 336. On Monday, 124 books are taken out, so we subtract these from the initial number:

\[ 336 - 124 = 212 \]

On Tuesday, 22 books are brought back, so we add these to the current number of books:

\[ 212 + 22 = 234 \]

So, there are now 234 books in the library.
