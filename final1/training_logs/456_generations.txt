Fiona completed 36 math questions in an hour. Shirley was able to complete twice as many math questions within that same time, and Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions. If they each did the same number of questions the following hour, how many math questions did all three girls complete in 2 hours?

<Fiona completed 36 math questions in an hour.>
<Shirley completed twice as many math questions within that same time, which means Shirley completed \(2 \times 36 = 72\) questions in an hour.>

<Sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions: \(36 + 72 = 108\).>
<Kiana completed half of this sum, so she completed \(108 \div 2 = 54\) questions in an hour.>

<In the following hour, each completed the same number of questions: 108 + 54 = 162 questions for each.>
 
<In two hours, for Fiona, it will be: 108 + 108 = 216 questions.>
<For Shirley, it will be: 72 + 72 = 144 questions.>
<Kiana, as she completed the same number each hour, will have a total of \(54 + 54 = 108\) questions over the two hours.>

<The total of math questions all three girls completed in 2 hours is: \(216 + 144 + 108 = 468\) questions.>

To find out how many math questions Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana completed in 2 hours, we need to calculate the total number of questions each girl completed in 1 hour and then multiply by 2.

1. **Fiona's questions in 1 hour:**
   Fiona completed 36 questions in 1 hour.

2. **Shirley's questions in 1 hour:**
   Shirley completed twice as many questions as Fiona. 
   \[
   \text{Shirley's questions in 1 hour} = 2 \times 36 = 72
   \]

3. **Kiana's questions in 1 hour:**
   Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions.
   \[
   \text{Sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions} = 36 + 72 = 108
   \]
   \[
   \text{Kiana's questions in 1 hour} = \frac{108}{2} = 54
   \]

4. **Combined total for 1 hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total questions in 1 hour for all three} = 36 + 72 + 54 = 162
   \]

5. **Total questions in 2 hours:**
   Since they each do the same number of questions in the following hour, we multiply the total for 1 hour by 2.
   \[
   \text{Total questions in 2 hours} = 162 \times 2 = 324
   \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Fiona's math questions:**
   - Fiona completed 36 math questions in the first hour.
   - In the next hour, she would complete the same number of questions, so:
     \[
     \text{Total for Fiona in 2 hours} = 36 + 36 = 72
     \]

2. **Shirley's math questions:**
   - Shirley completed twice as many math questions as Fiona in the first hour.
     \[
     \text{Shirley's questions in first hour} = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]
   - In the next hour, she would complete the same amount, so:
     \[
     \text{Total for Shirley in 2 hours} = 72 + 72 = 144
     \]

3. **Kiana's math questions:**
   - Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions in the first hour.
     \[
     \text{Sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions} = 36 + 72 = 108
     \]
     \[
     \text{Kiana's questions in the first hour} = \frac{108}{2} = 54
     \]
   - In the next hour, she would complete half of the remaining sum:
     \[
     \text{Remaining sum for Kiana} = 108 - 54 = 54
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total for Kiana in 2 hours} = 54 + 54 = 108
     \]

4. **Total questions in 2 hours for all three girls:**
   - Fiona: 72 questions
   - Shirley: 144 questions
   - Kiana: 108 questions
   \[
   \text{Total} = 72 + 144 + 108 = 324
   \]

Therefore, the total number of math questions completed by all three girls in 2 hours is 324.

To find out how many math questions Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana completed in two hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of math questions Shirley completed.
2. Calculate the number of math questions Kiana completed.
3. Sum the total for each girl over two hours to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Fiona completed 36 questions in the first hour.
2. Shirley completed twice as many as Fiona, which is 36 * 2.
3. Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's answers.

Now let's proceed to these calculations:
- Shirley's questions: 36 * 2 = 72 questions.
- Sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions: 36 + 72 = 108 questions.
- Kiana's questions: 108 / 2 = 54 questions.

Then we sum all the questions each girl completed over two hours.

Total questions:
- Fiona: 36 (first hour) + 36 (second hour) = 72 questions.
- Shirley: 72 questions (since she doesn't complete questions in the second hour).
- Kiana: 54 questions (second hour).

**Total questions completed by all three girls in two hours is 72 + 72 + 54. **

To determine the total number of math questions completed by Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana in 2 hours, we first need to calculate the total for the first hour.

1. Fiona's math questions:
   Fiona completed 36 questions in the first hour.

2. Shirley's math questions:
   Shirley completed twice as many questions as Fiona, so:
   \[
   2 \times 36 = 72
   \]

3. Kiana's math questions:
   Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions. First, we find the sum:
   \[
   36 + 72 = 108
   \]
   Then, Kiana's questions are half of this sum:
   \[
   \frac{108}{2} = 54
   \]

4. Total questions completed by all three in the first hour:
   \[
   36 + 72 + 54 = 162
   \]

5. Since they each did the same number of questions in the second hour, the total for the second hour is also 162.

6. Total questions completed in 2 hours:
   \[
   162 + 162 = 324
   \]

Thus, the total number of math questions completed by all three girls in 2 hours is:

Fiona completed 36 math questions in an hour.

Shirley completed twice as many as Fiona, which is \(2 \times 36 = 72\) questions in an hour.

Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times (36 + 72) = \frac{1}{2} \times 108 = 54\) questions in an hour.

In total, in one hour, the three girls completed \(36 + 72 + 54 = 162\) questions.

Reasoning:

1. Fiona completed 36 math questions in the first hour.
2. Shirley completed twice as many as Fiona, so she completed \(36 \times 2 = 72\) questions.
3. The sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions in the first hour is \(36 + 72 = 108\).
4. Kiana completed half of this sum, so she completed \(\frac{108}{2} = 54\) questions.

In total, the three girls completed \(36 + 72 + 54 = 162\) questions in the first hour.

If they each do the same number of questions in the following hour, we just need to double the number of questions they completed in the first hour, which is \(162 \times 2 = 324\).

Answer:

The three girls completed a total of 324 questions in 2 hours.

3. Sum the total number of questions all three girls completed in one hour.
4. Multiply by 2 to get the total for 2 hours.

Let's start by finding out how many questions each girl completed in one hour:

- Fiona completed 36 questions in one hour.
- Shirley completed twice as many as Fiona, so Shirley completed \(2 \times 36 = 72\) questions in one hour.
- Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions, so Kiana completed \(\frac{36 + 72}{2} = \frac{108}{2} = 54\) questions in one hour.

Now, let's sum the total number of questions they completed in one hour:

- Total questions in one hour = \(36 + 72 + 54 = 162\)

Since they each did the same number of questions the following hour, the total for two hours would be:

- Total questions in 2 hours = \(162 \times 2 = 324\)

So, all three girls completed 324 math questions in 2 hours.

To find the total number of questions completed by Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana in 2 hours, we'll start by calculating the number of questions completed by each girl in one hour, then sum them up.

First, Fiona completes 36 questions in one hour.
Shirley completes twice as many questions as Fiona in the same time, so she completes \( 2 \times 36 = 72 \) questions.
Kiana completes half the sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions, so she completes \( \frac{1}{2} \times (36 + 72) = \frac{1}{2} \times 108 = 54 \) questions.

Now, let's sum the number of questions completed by each girl in one hour:
- Fiona: 36 questions
- Shirley: 72 questions
- Kiana: 54 questions

Total for one hour: \( 36 + 72 + 54 = 162 \) questions

If they each did the same number of questions the following hour, the total number for 2 hours would be:
