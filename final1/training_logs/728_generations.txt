<reasoning>
One tarantula egg sac contains 1000 baby tarantulas. Each baby tarantula has 8 legs. Therefore, the number of legs in one egg sac is \(1000 \times 8\).

If each egg sac has 1000 baby tarantulas and you have 5 egg sacs, the total number of baby tarantulas is \(1000 \times 5 = 5000\).

Since each baby tarantula has 8 legs, the total number of baby tarantula legs is \(5000 \times 8\).

To find out how many baby tarantula legs there would be in one less than 5 egg sacs, you would calculate \(4 \times 5000\) and then multiply the total number of legs by 8.

To solve the problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the number of egg sacs, tarantulas per egg sac, and the legs each tarantula has.

1. Each tarantula has 8 legs.
2. If one egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas, then in one egg sac, the total number of legs would be \(1000 \times 8 = 8000\) legs.
3. We are asked to find the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs.

First, calculate the total number of egg sacs:
\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \]

Next, calculate the total number of tarantulas in 4 egg sacs:
\[ 4 \times 1000 = 4000 \]

Now, multiply the total number of tarantulas by the number of legs each tarantula has:
\[ 4000 \times 8 = 32000 \]

Therefore, the total number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs is 32000.

To determine the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs, we first need to understand the composition of one egg sac and then extend that understanding to one less than 5 egg sacs.

Each tarantula egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas. Each tarantula has 8 legs. Therefore, the number of legs in one egg sac is \(1000 \times 8 = 8000\) legs. One less than 5 egg sacs would be \(5 - 1 = 4\) egg sacs.

The number of legs in 4 egg sacs would be \(4 \times 8000 = 32000\) legs.

To determine the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of baby tarantulas in 5 egg sacs.
2. Determine the number of baby tarantulas in one less than 5 egg sacs (which means 4 egg sacs).
3. Calculate the total number of baby tarantula legs in those 4 egg sacs.

First, since one egg sac contains 1000 baby tarantulas, 5 egg sacs contain:
\[ 5 \times 1000 = 5000 \text{ baby tarantulas} \]

Therefore, 4 egg sacs would contain:
\[ 4 \times 1000 = 4000 \text{ baby tarantulas} \]

Each baby tarantula has 8 legs, so the total number of baby tarantula legs in 4 egg sacs is:
\[ 4000 \times 8 = 32000 \text{ legs} \]

So, the final answer is 32000.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine the number of tarantulas in one less than 5 egg sacs.
   - One less than 5 is 4.
   - Each egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas.
   - Therefore, 4 egg sacs contain \( 4 \times 1000 = 4000 \) tarantulas.

2. Calculate the number of legs on these tarantulas.
   - Each tarantula has 8 legs.
   - Therefore, 4000 tarantulas would have \( 4000 \times 8 = 32000 \) legs.

3. Determine the number of legs for one less than 5 egg sacs.
   - We know that 4 egg sacs contain 32000 legs.
   - Consequently, one less than 5 egg sacs would also contain 32000 legs.

To determine the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs, we first need to understand how many eggs are in one less than 5 egg sacs.

One less than 5 means 4 egg sacs. Each egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas. Since each tarantula has 8 legs, we calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ egg sacs} \times 1000 \text{ tarantulas/egg sac} \times 8 \text{ legs/tarantula} = 32000 \text{ legs} \]

Now we know that one less than 5 egg sacs contains 32,000 baby tarantula legs.

2. **Egg sacs and tarantulas**:
   - One egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas.
   - One less than 5 egg sacs is \(5 - 1 = 4\) egg sacs.

3. **Total tarantulas**:
   - Each of the 4 egg sacs contains 1000 tarantulas.
   - Therefore, the total number of tarantulas is \(1000 \times 4 = 4000\).

4. **Legs calculation**:

Each tarantula has 8 legs, so each baby tarantula also has 8 legs. If one egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas, then each egg sac has 1000 * 8 = 8000 baby tarantula legs. 

If we have 4 egg sacs, then the total number of baby tarantula legs is 4 * 8000 = 32000 legs. 

If we have one less than 5 egg sacs, then we have 5 - 1 = 4 egg sacs. 

So, the total number of baby tarantula legs in 4 egg sacs would be 4 * 8000 = 32000 legs.

To determine the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tarantulas in 5 egg sacs:**
   Each egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas. Therefore, in 5 egg sacs:
   \[
   5 \text{ egg sacs} \times 1000 \text{ tarantulas per egg sac} = 5000 \text{ tarantulas}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of baby tarantula legs in 5 egg sacs:**
   Each tarantula has 8 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs in 5 egg sacs:
   \[
   5000 \text{ tarantulas} \times 8 \text{ legs per tarantula} = 40000 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs:**
   One less than 5 is 4. Therefore, calculate the number of baby tarantula legs in 4 egg sacs:
   \[
   4 \text{ egg sacs} \times 40000 \text{ legs per 4 egg sacs} = 160000 \text{ legs}
   \]

Thus, the total number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs is 160,000.

A single tarantula has 8 legs, and since one tarantula egg sac can contain 1000 tarantulas, each egg sac would have \(1000 \times 8 = 8000\) legs (one leg per tarantula).
If one egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas, then one less than 5 egg sacs would have \(5 - 1 = 4\) egg sacs.

The total number of legs in one less than 5 egg sacs can be calculated as follows: 

1. First, let's determine the number of egg sacs considered, which is "one less than 5", resulting in 4 egg sacs.
2. Each egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas, and each tarantula has 8 legs.
3. Therefore, the total number of legs in one egg sac is \(1000 \text{ tarantulas} \times 8 \text{ legs/tarantula} = 8000 \text{ legs}\).
4. For 4 egg sacs, the total number of legs is \(4 \times 8000 = 32000 \text{ legs}\).
5. Since 1 less than 5 means we subtract 1 from 5, that would be 4 egg sacs, not 5.

Thus, the total number of legs in one less than 4 egg sacs is 32,000.

Each tarantula has 8 legs. Therefore, one tarantula egg sac with 1000 tarantulas will contain \(8 \times 1000 = 8000\) legs. 

If we consider five egg sacs, the total number of tarantulas would be \(5 \times 1000 = 5000\). Thus, the total number of legs would be \(8 \times 5000 = 40000\). 

We are asked to find the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs, which means we need to subtract one from 5. Hence, this would be one less than 4 egg sacs. So, we have \(4 \times 1000 = 4000\) tarantulas from four egg sacs, which means \(4 \times 8 \times 1000 = 32000\) legs. 

Therefore, the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than five egg sacs will be \(40000 - 32000 = 8000\).
