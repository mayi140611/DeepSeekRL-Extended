<reasoning>
First, let's determine how much money Catherine has. Since Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 2 \times \text{Cecil's money} - 250 \]

Given that Cecil has $600, we substitute Cecil's money into the equation:

\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 2 \times 600 - 250 = 1200 - 250 = 950 \]

Next, let's find out how much money Carmela has. According to the information provided, Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money:

\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 2 \times \text{Cecil's money} + 50 \]

Substituting Cecil's money into this equation:

\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 2 \times 600 + 50 = 1200 + 50 = 1250 \]

Now, we summarize the money each person has:

\[ \text{Cecil} = \$600 \]
\[ \text{Catherine} = \$950 \]
\[ \text{Carmela} = \$1250 \]

Finally, to find out how much money they all have altogether, we sum the amounts:
\[ \text{Total money} = Cecil's\ money + Catherine's\ money + Carmela's\ money \]
\[ \text{Total money} = 600 + 950 + 1250 = 2800 \]

So, altogether, Cecil, Catherine, and Carmela have $2800.

<reasoning>
To determine the total amount of money that Cecil, Catherine, and Carmela have together, we need to calculate the individual amounts and then sum them up.

First, identify the amount of money Cecil has. Cecil has $600.

Next, calculate the amount of money Catherine has. According to the problem, Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil. So, we calculate twice Cecil's money, which is \(2 \times 600 = 1200\). Catherine then has \(1200 - 250 = 950\). 

Now, calculate the amount of money Carmela has. The problem states that Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money. So, we first find twice Cecil's money, which is \(2 \times 600 = 1200\). Then, add $50, resulting in \(1200 + 50 = 1250\). 

Finally, add the amounts of money each person has together to find the total:
\[
600 + 950 + 1250 = 2800
\]
Therefore, the total amount of money that Cecil, Catherine, and Carmela have together is $2800.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cecil's money**: Cecil has $600.
2. **Catherine's money**: Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil.
   - Twice as much as Cecil's money is \(2 \times 600 = 1200\).
   - Catherine has \(1200 - 250 = 950\).
3. **Carmela's money**: Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money.
   - Twice as much as Cecil's money is \(2 \times 600 = 1200\).
   - Carmela has \(1200 + 50 = 1250\).

Now we add up all their money:
- Cecil's money: $600
- Catherine's money: $950
- Carmela's money: $1250

Total money: \(600 + 950 + 1250 = 2800\).

Therefore, they have together $2800.

First, we need to calculate how much money Catherine has. According to the problem, Catherine has $250 less than twice Cecil's money. Cecil has $600, so Catherine has:

\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 2 \times \text{Cecil's money} - 250 \]
\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 2 \times 600 - 250 \]
\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 1200 - 250 \]
\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 950 \]

Next, we calculate how much money Carmela has. Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money. Cecil has $600, so Carmela has:

\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 2 \times \text{Cecil's money} + 50 \]
\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 2 \times 600 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 1200 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 1250 \]

Now, we sum up the money that Cecil, Catherine, and Carmela have:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Cecil's money} + \text{Catherine's money} + \text{Carmela's money} \]
\[ \text{Total money} = 600 + 950 + 1250 \]
\[ \text{Total money} = 2800 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they have altogether is $2800.

To find out how much money Cecil, Catherine, and Carmela have altogether, we need to calculate the amount each person has based on the information given.

1. Cecil has $600.
2. Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil.
   - Twice as much as Cecil is $600 * 2 = $1200.
   - $250 less than this is $1200 - $250 = $950.
   - So, Catherine has $950.

3. Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money.
   - Twice Cecil's money is $600 * 2 = $1200.
   - $50 more than this is $1200 + $50 = $1250.
   - So, Carmela has $1250.

Now, we add up the amounts that Cecil, Catherine, and Carmela have:
- Cecil: $600
- Catherine: $950
- Carmela: $1250

Total = $600 + $950 + $1250 = $2800.

Therefore, the total amount of money they have altogether is $2800.

We are given the following amounts:
- Cecil has $600. Let's denote Cecil's money as \( C_E \). Thus, \( C_E = 600 \).
- Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil. Let's denote Catherine's money as \( C_C \). Thus, \( C_C = 2 \times C_E - 250 \).
- Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money. Let's denote Carmela's money as \( C_M \). Thus, \( C_M = 2 \times C_E + 50 \).

We need to find the total amount of money they have altogether. We can calculate each of their amounts first and then sum them up.

First, calculate \( C_C \):
\[ C_C = 2 \times 600 - 250 = 1200 - 250 = 950 \]

Next, calculate \( C_M \):
\[ C_M = 2 \times 600 + 50 = 1200 + 50 = 1250 \]

Now, calculate the total amount of money they have altogether:
\[ \text{Total} = C_E + C_C + C_M = 600 + 950 + 1250 \]

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 600 + 950 = 1550 \]
\[ 1550 + 1250 = 2800 \]

So, they have a total of $2800.

Let's start by calculating how much Catherine has. Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil. Since Cecil has $600, twice Cecil's money is \(2 \times 600 = 1200\). So, Catherine has \(1200 - 250 = 950\).

Next, let's calculate how much Carmela has. Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money. Twice Cecil's money is $1200, and adding $50 gives us \(1200 + 50 = 1250\).

To find out how much they have altogether, we add Cecil's, Catherine's, and Carmela's money together: \(600 + 950 + 1250 = 2800\).

Therefore, they have $2800 altogether.

2. Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil.
   - Twice Cecil's money: \(2 \times 600 = 1200\)
   - $250 less than twice Cecil's money: \(1200 - 250 = 950\)
   So, Catherine has $950.
3. Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money.

   - $50 more than twice Cecil's money: \(1200 + 50 = 1250\)
   So, Carmela has $1250.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money they have together.

Total money = Cecil's money + Catherine's money + Carmela's money
Total money = $600 + $950 + $1250
Total money = $2800

Therefore, they have a total of $2800.

Let's denote Cecil's money by \( C \). According to the problem, Cecil has $600, so \( C = 600 \).

Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil. Therefore, Catherine's money can be calculated as:
\[ 2C - 250 \]

Substituting the value of \( C \):
\[ 2 \times 600 - 250 = 1200 - 250 = 950 \]
So, Catherine has $950.

Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money. Therefore, Carmela's money can be calculated as:
\[ 2C + 50 \]

Substituting the value of \( C \):
\[ 2 \times 600 + 50 = 1200 + 50 = 1250 \]
So, Carmela has $1250.

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have altogether by summing up their individual amounts:
\[ C + (2C - 250) + (2C + 50) \]
\[ 600 + 950 + 1250 = 2800 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they have altogether is $2800.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Cecil has $600.

Next, we need to determine how much money Catherine has. The problem states that Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil. So, we calculate Catherine's money as follows:
\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 2 \times \text{Cecil's money} - 250 \]
\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 2 \times 600 - 250 \]
\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 1200 - 250 \]
\[ \text{Catherine's money} = 950 \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Carmela has. The problem states that Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money. So, we calculate Carmela's money as follows:
\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 2 \times \text{Cecil's money} + 50 \]
\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 2 \times 600 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 1200 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Carmela's money} = 1250 \]

Finally, we need to find out how much money they have altogether. We add up the amounts of money that Cecil, Catherine, and Carmela have:
\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Cecil's money} + \text{Catherine's money} + \text{Carmela's money} \]
\[ \text{Total money} = 600 + 950 + 1250 \]
\[ \text{Total money} = 2800 \]

So, they have $2800 altogether.
