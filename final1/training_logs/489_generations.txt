###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?

#### ANS ####

70
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To solve this, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Given the perimeter is \(160\) cm and two sides are \(40\) cm and \(50\) cm, we can set up the following equation:

\[40 + 50 + x = 160\]

Simplifying the equation, we find \(x = 160 - 40 - 50\).

\[x = 70\]

Therefore, the length of the third side is \(70\) cm.

To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle. The perimeter \( P \) of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. Given that the perimeter \( P = 160 \) cm, and two sides are \( 40 \) cm and \( 50 \) cm, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ P = a + b + c \]
\[ 160 = 40 + 50 + c \]

Now, we can solve for \( c \):

\[ c = P - (40 + 50) \]
\[ c = 160 - 90 \]
\[ c = 70 \] cm

Therefore, the length of the third side is 70 cm.

Let's denote the third side of the triangle as \(x\). The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all its sides. Given that two sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, and the total perimeter is 160 cm, we can set up the following equation:

\[40 + 50 + x = 160\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[90 + x = 160\]

Subtracting 90 from both sides gives:

\[x = 160 - 90\]
\[x = 70\]

So, the length of the third side is 70 cm.

Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Given that we know two of the sides and the perimeter, we can find the third side by subtracting the sum of those two sides from the perimeter.

Perimeter = Side1 + Side2 + Side3

160 cm = 40 cm + 50 cm + Side3

Now, let's solve for Side3:

Side3 = 160 cm - 40 cm - 50 cm
      = 160 cm - 90 cm
      = 70 cm

So, the length of the third side is 70 cm.

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. Let's denote the lengths of the sides as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Given that two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, let's assume \(a = 40\) cm and \(b = 50\) cm. The third side is then \(c\).

The perimeter is given as 160 cm. So, we can write the equation for the perimeter as:

\[a + b + c = 160\]

Substituting the given values for \(a\) and \(b\):

\[40 + 50 + c = 160\]

Simplify the equation:

\[90 + c = 160\]

To find \(c\), subtract 90 from both sides of the equation:

\[c = 160 - 90\]
\[c = 70\]

So, the length of the third side is 70 cm.

To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. This is called the triangle inequality theorem.

Let's denote the length of the third side as \( x \).

According to the triangle inequality theorem, we have:
1. \( 40 + 50 > x \)
2. \( 40 + x > 50 \)
3. \( 50 + x > 40 \)

Simplifying these inequalities:
1. \( 90 > x \) or \( x < 90 \)
2. \( x > 10 \) (since \( 40 + 50 = 90 \), and for \( x \) to be greater than 10, adding \( x \) to 50 should still be greater than 40, but it doesn't actually change the inequality)
3. \( x > -10 \) (which is always true for positive lengths)

Given that \( x \) must be a positive length (since the sides of a triangle cannot be negative), we combine the first two inequalities to get:
\[ 10 < x < 90 \]

Now, to find the length of the third side, we use the perimeter formula for a triangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = \text{Side}_1 + \text{Side}_2 + \text{Side}_3 \]
\[ 160 = 40 + 50 + x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 160 - 40 - 50 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the length of the third side is 70 cm.
