If you bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, then you bought 36/3 = 12 of each. If the price of 1 orange is $0.50, then the price of 12 oranges is 12*$0.50 = $6.00 If 4 apples or 1 watermelon cost the same amount, then 12/4 = 3 apples, or 3 watermelons. If your total bill was $66, and you paid $6.00 for 12 oranges and $6.00 for 3 watermelons, then 12 oranges + 3 watermelons = $12.00. So 36 fruits - 12 oranges - 3 watermelons = $66.00 - $12.00 = $54.00. Therefore, 1 apple cost $54.00 / 3 = $18.00.

Let \( x \) be the price of one apple. You bought 36 fruits, with an equal ratio of oranges, apples, and watermelons, so you bought \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) of each type. The price of 1 orange is $0.50, and since you bought 12 oranges, the total cost of oranges is \( 12 \times 0.50 = $6 \). The total bill was $66, so the cost of apples and watermelons combined is \( 66 - 6 = $60 \). Since you bought 12 apples and 12 watermelons, the cost of apples plus watermelons is \( 12x + 12 \times x = 24x \). So, we have the equation:

\[ 24x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{60}{24} = 2.50 \]

Let's denote the cost of one watermelon as \( W \) and the cost of one apple as \( A \). According to the information given, the price of 4 apples or 1 watermelon is the same, so we can write the equation:

\[ 4A = W \]

You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons, which means you bought 12 each of these fruit types. You bought 36 in total, so:

\[ 12 \text{ oranges} + 12 \text{ apples} + 12 \text{ watermelons} = 36 \text{ fruits} \]

You also know that the price of one orange is $0.50. If the total bill was $66, we can write:

\[ \text{Price of 12 oranges} + \text{Price of 12 apples} + \text{Price of 12 watermelons} = 66 \]

Substituting the price of one orange, we get:

\[ 0.5 \times 12 + 12A + 12W = 66 \]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( 4A = W \)
2. \( 0.5 \times 12 + 12A + 12W = 66 \)

Let's solve for \( A \) using these equations. First, solve equation 1 for \( W \):

\[ W = 4A \]

Substitute \( W \) in the second equation:

\[ 0.5 \times 12 + 12A + 12(4A) = 66 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 6 + 12A + 48A = 66 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 60A = 60 \]

Now, divide both sides by 60:

\[ A = 1 \]

So, the cost of one apple is $1.00.

Let's denote the number of apples as \( A \), the number of oranges as \( O \), and the number of watermelons as \( W \). From the problem, we know that the total number of fruits is 36, so we have:

\[ A + O + W = 36 \]

We also know that the total bill is $66, and the cost of 1 orange is $0.50. Let the cost of 1 apple be \( x \) dollars and the cost of 1 watermelon be \( y \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost can be written as:

\[ 36x + 0.50O + yW = 66 \]

We are also given that 4 apples cost the same as 1 watermelon, so:

\[ 4x = y \]

Now we have three equations:

1. \( A + O + W = 36 \)
2. \( 36x + 0.50O + Wy = 66 \)
3. \( 4x = y \)

We need to find the value of \( x \). First, let's express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) from the third equation:

\[ y = 4x \]

Now substitute \( y \) into the second equation:

\[ 36x + 0.50O + 4xW = 66 \]

Since \( W = \frac{y}{4} = \frac{4x}{4} = x \), we substitute \( W \) with \( x \):

\[ 36x + 0.50O + 4x^2 = 66 \]

We also know from the first equation that \( A + O + x = 36 \), so \( O = 36 - A - x \). Substitute this into the simplified second equation:

\[ 36x + 0.50(36 - A - x) + 4x^2 = 66 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 36x + 18 - 0.50A - 0.50x + 4x^2 = 66 \]
\[ 0.50x + 18 - 0.50A + 4x^2 = 66 \]
\[ 4x^2 + 0.50x + 18 - 0.50A = 66 \]
\[ 4x^2 + 0.50x - 0.50A = 48 \]
\[ 8x^2 + x - A = 96 \]
\[ A = 8x^2 + x - 96 \]

We need to find the value of \( x \). Since \( A \) must be a positive integer, let's test possible values of \( x \). Let's try \( x = 3 \):

\[ A = 8(3)^2 + 3 - 96 \]
\[ A = 72 + 3 - 96 \]
\[ A = 75 - 96 \]
\[ A = -21 \]

This is not possible. Let's try \( x = 2 \):

\[ A = 8(2)^2 + 2 - 96 \]
\[ A = 32 + 2 - 96 \]
\[ A = 34 - 96 \]
\[ A = -62 \]

This is also not possible. Let's try \( x = 3 \) again:

\[ A = 8(3

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of each type of fruit:**
   - The total number of fruits is 36, which is evenly divided between oranges, apples, and watermelons.
   - Therefore, there are 36 / 3 = 12 of each fruit.

2. **Identify the known quantities and given information:**
   - Oranges cost $0.50 each.
   - Total bill is $66.

3. **Calculate the cost of oranges:**
   - Since there are 12 oranges, the cost of oranges is 12 * $0.50.

4. **Calculate the total cost of oranges and watermelons:**
   - Let the cost of one apple be \( x \).
   - 3 apples cost \( 3x \).
   - 1 watermelon costs the same as 4 apples, so it costs \( 4x \).

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total cost of the fruits is the sum of the cost of oranges, apples, and watermelons.
   - So, \( 3 \times 0.50 + 3x + 4x = 66 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 1.50 + 3x + 4x = 66 \).
   - Combine like terms: \( 1.50 + 7x = 66 \).
   - Subtract 1.50 from both sides: \( 7x = 64.50 \).
   - Divide by 7: \( x = \frac{64.50}{7} \approx 9.214 \).

Therefore, the cost of one apple is approximately $9.21.

Let's break down the information given:
1. 4 apples or 1 watermelon cost the same.
2. The total number of fruits bought is 36 evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons.
3. The total bill is $66.
4. The price of 1 orange is $0.50.

Let's set up the equations based on the information:

- Let \( A \) be the price of 1 apple.
- The price of 1 watermelon is \( 4A \) (since 1 watermelon costs the same as 4 apples).
- The number of each fruit bought is:
  - Oranges: \( x \)
  - Apples: \( \frac{36 - x - x}{4} \) (since the total is 30 fruits, evenly split, which means \( x \) are oranges and \( \frac{36 - x}{2} \) are apples, 18 total)
  - Watermelons: \( \frac{36 - x - x}{4} \) (since watermelons and apples are split, same amount, and total 18)

Now, let's use the total bill:
\[ 0.50x + 4A \cdot \frac{36 - x - x}{4} + A \cdot \frac{36 - x - x}{4} = 66 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 0.50x + 9A(18 - x) = 66 \]
\[ 0.50x + 162A - 9Ax = 66 \]

Rearranging terms for \( A \):
\[ 162A - 9Ax - 0.50x = 66 \]
\[ A(162 - 9x - 0.50) = 66 \]

Since the total bill is $66, we know the total cost can also be broken down into two parts:
\[ x \cdot 0.50 + \frac{36 - x}{4} \cdot A = 66 \]

We need to solve these equations simultaneously. However, since the equations are complex, we can use the information that watermelons and apples are the same cost:
\[ 4A = \frac{36 - x}{4} \cdot A = x \cdot 0.50 \]

From the second expression:
\[ 2A = 0.50x \]
\[ A = 0.25x \]

Substituting \( A = 0.25x \) into the total bill equation:
\[ 0.25x \cdot 18 + 4 \cdot 0.25x \cdot (18 - x) = 66 \]
\[ 4.5x + 18x(18 - x) = 66 \]
\[ 4.5x + 324x - 18x^2 = 66 \]
\[ 328.5x - 18x^2 = 66 \]
\[ 98.5x^2 - 328.5x + 66 = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[ x = \frac{328.5 \pm \sqrt{328.5^2 - 4 \cdot 98.5 \cdot 66}}{

Total cost of apples: 4 * ($66 - $6 - cost of watermelons)

Total cost of all fruits: $66

The total number of fruits is 36 divided into three parts: oranges, apples, and watermelons. Each part is 36 ÷ 3 = 12 fruits. Since 4 apples cost as much as 1 watermelon, 12 - 4 = 8 apples cost as much as 1 watermelon. Let c be the cost of 1 watermelon.

Watermelons: 12 / 8 = 1.5 apples
Oranges: 1 * 12 = 12

The total cost for apples and oranges is $66 - the cost of 1.5 watermelons: 66 - 1.5c dollars. Since the cost of 1 orange is $0.50, the total cost for oranges is 0.5 * 12 = 6. We set up a new equation: 1.5c + 6 = 66, which simplifies to 1.5c = 60, meaning the cost of the watermelons is 40 dollars. The cost per apple (1/c) is 40 ÷ 8 = 5 dollars.

Given that 4 apples cost the same as 1 watermelon, we can express the cost of 4 apples as the cost of 1 watermelon. If we also know that the price of 1 orange is $0.50, then the total cost of 36 fruits, which includes oranges, apples, and watermelons, can be set up as follows:

Let the price of 1 apple be \( x \) dollars.

First, we know that:
- 4 apples cost the same as 1 watermelon.
- 36 fruits are evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons.

We also know:
- The price of 1 orange is $0.50.

Let's denote the number of orange, apple, and watermelon purchases:
- Oranges = 36 / 3 = 12
- Apples = 36 / 3 = 12
- Watermelons = 36 / 3 = 12

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 12 \cdot 0.50 + 12 \cdot x + 12 \cdot y = 66 \]

Since \( y \) (the number of watermelons) must equal 12 (as well as the number of oranges and apples, we can conclude \( y = 12 \)). Therefore:

\[ 12 \cdot 0.50 + 12 \cdot x + 12 \cdot 12 = 66 \]
\[ 6 + 12x + 144 = 66 \]
\[ 12x + 150 = 66 \]
\[ 12x = 66 - 150 \]
\[ 12x = -84 \]
\[ x = -84 / 12 \]
\[ x = -7 \]

This calculation shows an error, leading to a negative cost for apples which is not logically possible. Since oranges cost $0.50 each, the total cost of oranges should be:
\[ 12 \cdot 0.50 = 6 \]

Therefore, the correct equation should be:
\[ 6 + 12x = 66 \]
\[ 12x = 60 \]
\[ x = 60 / 12 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, calculating the cost of one apple at $5.

Since the price of 4 apples is equal to the price of 1 watermelon, we can say that the price of 1 watermelon (W) is equal to the price of 4 apples (A).

We know that the price of 1 orange (O) is $0.50.

Let's assume that the number of oranges bought is x, apples is y, and watermelons is z.

Since the total number of fruits bought is 36, we have the equation:

x + y + z = 36

We also know that the total bill was $66 and the price of 1 orange is $0.50, so the cost of the oranges is:

0.50x

We also know that the price of 1 watermelon is equal to the price of 4 apples, so the cost of the watermelons is:

W = 4A

Since the price of 4 apples is equal to the price of 1 watermelon, we can say that:

4A = W

We also know that the total cost of all the fruits is $66, so we have the equation:

0.50x + A + (4A) = 66

Simplifying, we get:

0.50x + 5A = 66

Now we have two equations:

1) x + y + z = 36
2) 0.50x + 5A = 66

We also know that the total number of fruits is evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons, so:

x = y = z

Therefore, we can substitute x with y in the second equation:

0.50x + 5A = 66
0.50x + 5x = 66
5.50x = 66
x = 66/5.50
x = 12

Since x = y = z, we now know that the number of oranges is 12, the number of apples is 12, and the number of watermelons is 12.

Since we know the price of 1 orange is $0.50, we can find the price of 1 apple by subtracting the price of 1 orange from the total cost of all the fruits:

Total cost of oranges = 12 * $0.50 = $6
Total cost of apples = $66 - $6 - (4 * $0.50) = $56

Now, we can find the price of 1 apple by dividing the total cost of the apples by the number of apples:

Price of 1 apple = $56 / 12 = $4.67

Let's denote the price of an apple as \( A \), a watermelon as \( W \), and an orange as \( O \). According to the problem, we know that 4 apples cost the same as 1 watermelon and 1 orange, so we can write:
\[ 4A = W + O \]

We also know that the price of 1 orange is $0.50, so:
\[ O = 0.50 \]

Additionally, we know that the total number of fruits bought is 36, which are evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons, so each fruit type counts as 1/3 of the total number of fruits:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \text{ apples, 12 watermelons, and 12 oranges} \]

We can summarize this as:
\[ 4A = 12W + 12O \]

Given \( O = 0.50 \), we substitute into the equation:
\[ 4A = 12W + 12 \times 0.50 \]
\[ 4A = 12W + 6 \]

We also know the total cost of all fruits is $66:
\[ 12W + 12A + 12O = 66 \]

Substituting \( O = 0.50 \) into the equation:
\[ 12W + 12A + 6 = 66 \]
\[ 12W + 12A = 60 \]
\[ W + A = 5 \]

Now we have the equation:
\[ 4A = 12(W + 0.50) \]
\[ 4A = 12W + 6 \]
\[ 4A = 12A + 6 \]
\[ 8A = 6 \]
\[ A = \frac{6}{8} \]
\[ A = 0.75 \]

So, the price of 1 apple is $0.75.

Let's denote the cost of 1 apple as \( A \) dollars and the cost of 1 watermelon as \( W \) dollars. According to the problem, 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 4A = W \]
\[ A = \frac{W}{4} \]

The fruits bought are evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons, totaling 36 fruits. This means that the number of oranges, apples, and watermelons is the same:
\[ O + A + W = 36 \]
where \( O \) is the number of oranges. We don't know the exact number of each, but we can substitute the known price of oranges to find the cost of apples and watermelons.

The total cost of the fruits is $66. The price of 1 orange is $0.50, so the total cost of 36 oranges is:
\[ 36 \times 0.50 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]
Let the number of oranges be \( O \). Then:
\[ O \times 0.50 = 18 \]
\[ O = \frac{18}{0.50} = 36 \]

So, we know there are 36 oranges, which means there are 36/3 = 12 apples and 12 watermelons. Substituting \( O = 36 \) into the equation \( O + A + W = 36 \):
\[ 36 + A + W = 36 \]
\[ A + W = 0 \]

From the earlier equation, \( A = \frac{W}{4} \), we can substitute and solve for \( W \):
\[ A + W = 0 \]
\[ \frac{W}{4} + W = 0 \]
\[ \frac{W + 4W}{4} = 0 \]
\[ 5W / 4 = 0 \]
\[ W = 0 \]

This doesn't make sense since there are watermelons. Let's re-evaluate the setup. We know that the total cost equation should balance, and we need to recheck the individual equations properly:

Given \( A = \frac{W}{4} \) and \( W + A + O = 36 \), with the constraints:
\[ O + \frac{W}{4} + W = 36 \]
\[ 36 + \frac{5W}{4} = 36 \]
\[ \frac{5W}{4} = 0 \]
\[ W = 0 \]

But this again does not work properly. Let's start with the oranges directly. The oranges are evenly distributed:
\[ O = 36 \]
with:
\[ 36 \times 0.50 = 18 \]
for oranges. Total cost of apples and watermelons:
\[ 36 - O = 18 \text{ oranges} \]
Since \( A = \frac{W}{4} \) and \( W + A = 0 \), it correctly means that:
\[ A + \frac{W}{4} = 18 \]
Since \( W = 0 \) leads to confusion, consider the correct setup:
\[ W = 4A \]
\[ 36 + 4A = 36 - 18 \]
\[ 4A = 18 \]
\[ A = \frac{18}{4} = 4.50 \]

So, the cost of 1 apple is $4.50.

Let's denote the price of one apple as \( A \) dollars and the price of one watermelon as \( W \) dollars.

From the information given:
1. \( 4A = W \) (You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price)
2. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50.
3. Your total bill was $66.

Since the fruits are split evenly, you bought \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) oranges. The cost of 12 oranges is \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \) dollars.

Let's denote the price of one orange as \( O \), which we know is $0.50. Therefore, the cost of 12 oranges is \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \) dollars.

Now, let's denote the price of one apple as \( A \), and the price of one watermelon as \( W \). Since \( 4A = W \).

The total cost of the fruits you bought can be represented as:
\[ 12O + 12A + 12W = 66 \]
Since \( O = 0.50 \), we can substitute that in:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 + 12A + 12W = 66 \]
\[ 6 + 12A + 12W = 66 \]
\[ 12A + 12W = 60 \]
Now, as we have \( 4A = W \), we can substitute \( W \) with \( 4A \):
\[ 12A + 12(4A) = 60 \]
\[ 12A + 48A = 60 \]
\[ 60A = 60 \]
\[ A = 1 \]

So, the price of 1 apple is $1.00.

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of oranges, apples, and watermelons:
   - Total cost = $6.00 (oranges) + $66 (fruit total) = $72

4. Now we can find the total cost of the apples (12 apples):
   - Total cost of apples = $72 - $66 = $6

5. Finally, to find the cost of one apple, we divide the total cost of apples by the number of apples:
   - Cost of one apple = $6 / 12 = $0.50

Let's denote the cost of one apple as A and the price of one watermelon as M. According to the problem, we have:

\[ 4A = M \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 66 \]

We also know that the total number of fruits is 36 and they are evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons. Let's denote the number of apples as \( 36 \times \frac{4}{5} \) because 4/5 of the fruits are apples. Let's denote the number of watermelons as \( 36 \times \frac{1}{5} \).

\[ \text{Number of oranges} = 36 - \text{number of apples} - \text{number of watermelons} \]

Given the price of 1 orange is $0.50, we have:

\[ \text{Cost of oranges} = 1 \times (\text{number of oranges} \times 0.50) \]

We know the total cost of the oranges is 1/5 of the total cost, since the oranges are 1/5 of the total fruits. So the cost of oranges is:

\[ \text{Cost of oranges} = \frac{1}{5} \times 66 = 13.2 \]

Now we can set up the equation for the total cost:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 66 = \frac{1}{5} \times (1 \times (\text{number of oranges} \times 0.50) + 36 \times A) \]

\[ 13.2 = 36 \times A \]

\[ A = \frac{13.2}{36} \]

\[ A = 0.3833... \]

Therefore, 1 apple costs approximately $0.38.

Let's assume the cost of 1 apple is \( x \) dollars.

Since each type of fruit costs the same per unit of weight, and we know the price of an apple and the number of oranges, we can set up the following equation based on the total cost:

\[ 4x + 36 = 66 \]

We know the total number of fruits bought is split evenly between oranges, apples, and watermelons. Let's assume the total number of each type of fruit is \( y \). So we have:

\[ 2x + y + 1y = 36 \]
\[ y + y = 36 \]
\[ 2y = 36 \]
\[ y = 18 \]

Since each type of fruit costs the same, the total price for the oranges and apples is equal to the total price for the watermelons:

\[ 4x + 16x = 66 \]
\[ 20x = 66 \]
\[ x = \frac{66}{20} \]
\[ x = 3.3 \]

So, the cost of 1 apple is $3.30.
