system
To calculate Elizabeth's net profit, we need to account for the cost of ingredients, the revenue from selling 20 bags of granola, and the revenue from selling 5 bags with a markdown.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for 20 bags:
Cost of ingredients per bag = $3.00
Total cost of ingredients for 20 bags = $3.00 * 20 = $60.00

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 20 bags at $6.00 each:
Revenue from 20 bags at $6.00 each = $6.00 * 20 = $120.00

Then, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining 5 bags at $4.00 each:
Revenue from 5 bags at $4.00 each = $4.00 * 5 = $20.00

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from selling both the initial 20 bags and the markdown 5 bags:
Total revenue = Revenue from 20 bags + Revenue from 5 bags
Total revenue = $120.00 + $20.00 = $140.00

Finally, we can calculate Elizabeth's net profit by subtracting the total cost of ingredients from the total revenue:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of ingredients
Net profit = $140.00 - $60.00 = $80.00

Therefore, Elizabeth's net profit is $80.00.

To calculate Elizabeth's net profit, we'll need to consider both her profit from selling the granola and any potential losses from marking down the remaining bags.

1. **Profit from selling the first 15 bags:**
   - Each bag is sold for $6.00.
   - Cost per bag: $3.00
   - Profit per bag: $6.00 - $3.00 = $3.00
   - Total profit from 15 bags: 15 bags * $3.00/bag = $45.00

2. **Loss from selling the next 5 bags:**
   - The bag is sold at $4.00.
   - Cost per bag: $3.00
   - Loss per bag: $4.00 - $3.00 = $1.00
   - Total loss from 5 bags: 5 bags * $1.00/bag = $5.00

3. **Net profit calculation:**
   - Total profit from selling the first 15 bags: $45.00
   - Total loss from selling the remaining 5 bags: $5.00
   - Net profit = Total profit - Total loss = $45.00 - $5.00 = $40.00

Therefore, Elizabeth's net profit is $40.00.

To calculate Elizabeth's net profit, we need to consider her total revenue and subtract her total costs.

1. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost of ingredients is $3.00 per bag.
   - Elizabeth makes 20 bags.
   - Total cost = $3.00/bag * 20 bags = $60.00

2. **Revenue Calculation:**
   - She sells 15 bags at $6.00 each.
   - Revenue from first 15 bags = $6.00/bag * 15 bags = $90.00.
   - She sells the remaining 5 bags at $4.00 each.
   - Revenue from remaining 5 bags = $4.00/bag * 5 bags = $20.00.
   - Total revenue = $90.00 + $20.00 = $110.00.

3. **Net Profit Calculation:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Net profit = $110.00 - $60.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Elizabeth's net profit is $50.00.

To determine Elizabeth's net profit, we need to calculate her total revenue from selling the granola bags and subtract her total cost of ingredients used.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Elizabeth sells 20 bags at $6.00 each.
   - Revenue from selling all 20 bags: \( 20 \times 6 \) = $120.00.
   - She sells 15 bags at $6.00 each for the first hour before closing.
   - Revenue from selling 15 bags: \( 15 \times 6 \) = $90.00.
   - She then marks down the remaining 5 bags to $4.00 and sells them.
   - Revenue from selling 5 bags at $4.00 each: \( 5 \times 4 \) = $20.00.
   - Total revenue: \( 90 + 20 \) = $110.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - She uses $3.00 worth of ingredients for each 20 bags.
   - Since she uses the same ingredients for all 20 bags, the total cost remains $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit: \( 110 - 3 \) = $107.00.

Therefore, the answer is 107.

To calculate Elizabeth's net profit, let's break down the total cost and the total revenue step-by-step.

1. **Total Cost:** Elizabeth uses ingredients to make 20 bags of granola. Each bag costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost is \(20 \times 3 = $60.00\).

2. **Total Revenue Before Marking Down:**
   - In the first hour, she sells 15 bags at $6.00 each.
   - Revenue from the first 15 bags: \(15 \times 6 = $90.00\).

3. **Revenue from Marked Down Bags:**
   - The remaining 5 bags were marked down to $4.00 each.
   - Revenue from the remaining 5 bags: \(5 \times 4 = $20.00\).

4. **Total Revenue:** \(90 + 20 = $110.00\).

5. **Net Profit:** Subtract the total cost from the total revenue.
   \[
   \text{Net Profit} = 110 - 60 = \$50.00

Let's break down the costs and profits:

1. Elizabeth uses $3.00 worth of ingredients for each bag.
   - For 20 bags, the total ingredients cost is \( 20 \times 3 = $60.00 \).
   - She has managed to sell 15 bags at $6.00 each, so the total revenue from these sales is \( 15 \times 6 = $90.00 \).
   - She has also sold 5 bags at $4.00 each, so the total revenue from these sales is \( 5 \times 4 = $20.00 \).

2. Therefore, her total revenue is \( 90 + 20 = $110.00 \).

3. Her total cost is the cost of the ingredients, which is \( 60.00 \).

To determine Elizabeth's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the granola bags.
2. Calculate the total cost of ingredients.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue.
4. Subtract any additional expenses from the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue.**

Elizabeth sells 20 bags at $6.00 each:
\[
20 \text{ bags} \times \$6.00 \text{ per bag} = \$120.00
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of ingredients.**

The cost of ingredients to make one bag is $3.00:
\[
20 \text{ bags} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bag} = \$60.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit before discounts.**

Total cost of ingredients:
\[
\$60.00
\]
Total revenue from selling 15 bags at $6.00 each:
\[
15 \text{ bags} \times \$6.00 \text{ per bag} = \$90.00
\]
Total revenue from selling the remaining 5 bags at $4.00 each:
\[
5 \text{ bags} \times \$4.00 \text{ per bag} = \$20.00
\]
Net profit before discounts:
\[
\$90.00 + \$20.00 - \$60.00 = \$50.00
\]

**Step 4: Subtract the additional expenses.**

In this problem, there are no additional expenses mentioned besides what was provided in the initial ingredients cost calculation. Therefore, the net profit remains \$50.00.

**Final Answer:**
Elizabeth's net profit is \(\boxed{50}\).

To calculate Elizabeth's net profit, we need to consider her costs, sales, and the markdowns she made.

1. **Initial Cost**: Elizabeth spends $3.00 on ingredients for each bag of granola. She makes 20 bags, so her initial cost is \( 20 \times 3.00 = $60.00 \).

2. **First Sale**: She sells 15 bags for $6.00 each. Her total revenue from the first 15 bags is \( 15 \times 6.00 = $90.00 \).

3. **Markdowns**: She then marks down the remaining 5 bags to $4.00 each and sells them. Her total revenue from the remaining 5 bags is \( 5 \times 4.00 = $20.00 \).

4. **Net Sales**: Her total sales are \( $90.00 + $20.00 = $110.00 \).

5. **Net Profit**: To find her net profit, we subtract her initial cost from her total sales: \( $110.00 - $60.00 = $50.00 \).

Therefore, her net profit is $50.00.

To find Elizabeth's net profit, we need to calculate her total revenue and subtract her total costs.

First, let's calculate her total revenue. 

- She makes 20 bags and sells them at $6.00 each. So the revenue from these is 20 * $6.00 = $120.00.

- An hour before closing, she has sold 15 bags at the original price. The revenue from these is 15 * $6.00 = $90.00.

- She marks down the remaining 5 bags to $4.00 each and sells them soon after. The revenue from these is 5 * $4.00 = $20.00.

The total revenue is the sum of these amounts: $120.00 + $90.00 + $20.00 = $230.00.

Next, let's calculate her total cost.

- She uses $3.00 worth of ingredients to make each bag. So, for 20 bags, the cost is 20 * $3.00 = $60.00.

- Because she has already sold 15 bags before marking them down, she has used ingredients on those 15 bags.

The total cost is the cost of all the ingredients used: $60.00.

Finally, we calculate her net profit.

Net Profit is Total Revenue - Total Cost = $230.00 - $60.00 = $170.00.

To calculate Elizabeth's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of ingredients.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the granola.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of ingredients.
Elizabeth uses $3.00 worth of ingredients for each bag of granola and makes 20 bags. So, the total cost of ingredients is:
\[ 3.00 \times 20 = \$60.00 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the granola.
She sells 15 bags at $6.00 per bag and the remaining 5 bags at $4.00 per bag. The revenue from selling the first 15 bags is:
\[ 15 \times 6.00 = \$90.00 \]
The revenue from selling the remaining 5 bags at $4.00 each is:
\[ 5 \times 4.00 = \$20.00 \]
So, the total revenue is:
\[ 90.00 + 20.00 = \$110.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the net profit.
Subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 110.00 - 60.00 = \$50.00 \]
