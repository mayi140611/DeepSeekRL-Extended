###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Kris is blowing u balloons for her sister’s party. She has 30 minutes to blow up as many balloons as possible and decides to enlist her brother’s help to increase the number of balloons. Kris can blow up a total of 2 balloon per minute, and her brother works twice as fast. After 15 minutes, her brother doubles his speed and works at this new speed for the remaining 15 minutes. After the 30 minutes, how many balloons, in total, did Kris and her brother blow up?

To determine the total number of balloons blown up, we need to calculate the number of balloons each person blows up and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of balloons Kris blows up:
\[ \text{Balloons Kris blows up} = 2 \text{ balloons/minute} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of balloons Kris's brother blows up:
Kris's brother's initial speed is 2 balloons per minute, and after 15 minutes, he doubles his speed to 4 balloons per minute for the remaining 15 minutes.
\[ \text{Balloons Kris's brother blows up before doubling} = 2 \text{ balloons/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ balloons} \]
\[ \text{Balloons Kris's brother blows up after doubling} = 4 \text{ balloons/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ balloons} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons Kris's brother blows up} = 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we can find the total number of balloons blown up by adding the balloons blown up by Kris and her brother:
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 60 + 90 = 150 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons blown up by Kris and her brother is \( 150 \).

Kris can blow up 2 balloons per minute.
Her brother works twice as fast, so he can blow up \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balloons per minute.
In the first 15 minutes, Kris and her brother together can blow up \(15 \times (2 + 4) = 15 \times 6 = 90\) balloons.

After the first 15 minutes, both of them continue working but on her brother's new speed, which is doubled to 8 balloons per minute.

In the remaining 15 minutes, her brother works at the new speed and can blow up \(15 \times 8 = 120\) balloons.

Adding both segments, in the 30 minutes, they together blow up a total of \(90 + 120 = 210\) balloons.

To determine the total number of balloons blown up, we need to break down the work into two parts: the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes.

1. **First 15 minutes:** 
   - Kris blows up balloons at a rate of 2 balloons per minute.
   - Her brother works at twice Kris's rate, so he blows up 4 balloons per minute.
   - Total balloons blown up in 15 minutes by Kris and her brother:
     \[
     2 \text{ (Kris) + 4 \text{ (her brother) }} \times 15 = 6 \text{ balloons} \times 15 = 90 \text{ balloons}
     \]

2. **Next 15 minutes (after the speed change):**
   - Her brother doubles his speed to 8 balloons per minute.
   - Kris continues to blow up balloons at her original speed, which is still 2 balloons per minute.
   - Total balloons blown up in the last 15 minutes by Kris and her brother:
     \[
     2 \text{ (Kris) + 8 \text{ (brother) }} \times 15 = 10 \text{ balloons} \times 15 = 150 \text{ balloons}
     \]

3. **Total balloons blown up:**
   - Adding the balloons blown up in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes:
     \[
     90 \text{ balloons} + 150 \text{ balloons} = 240 \text{ balloons}
     \]

Therefore, after the 30 minutes, Kris and her brother have blown up a total of 240 balloons.

Let's calculate the number of balloons each person blows up.

First 15 minutes:
- Kris works at a rate of 2 balloons per minute.
- Kris works for 15 minutes, so she blows up \(2 \times 15 = 30\) balloons.

Next 15 minutes:
- Kris works at a rate of 2 balloons per minute.
- Kris still works for 15 minutes, so she blows up \(2 \times 15 = 30\) balloons.
- Her brother works at a rate of \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balloons per minute.
- Her brother works for 15 minutes, so he blows up \(4 \times 15 = 60\) balloons.

Total number of balloons blown up by Kris:
\[30 (first 15 minutes) + 30 (next 15 minutes) = 60\]

Total number of balloons blown up by her brother:
\[60 (next 15 minutes) = 60\]

Total number of balloons blown up by Kris and her brother:
\[60 + 60 = 120\]

So, after 30 minutes, the total number of balloons blown up is 120.

Reasoning:

1. Kris can blow up 2 balloons per minute. In 15 minutes, she will blow up \(2 \times 15 = 30\) balloons.
2. Kris's brother works twice as fast as Kris, so he can blow up \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balloons per minute. In the first 15 minutes, he will blow up \(4 \times 15 = 60\) balloons.
3. After 15 minutes, her brother doubles his speed, so he now works at 4 balloons per minute and will blow up \(4 \times 15 = 60\) balloons in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. Adding up the balloons blown up by Kris and her brother: \(30 + 60 + 60 = 150\) balloons.

Therefore, Kris and her brother will together blow up 150 balloons after 30 minutes.

Kris blows up balloons at a rate of 2 balloons per minute. Her brother's initial speed is twice Kris's speed for the first 15 minutes, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balloons per minute. So for the first 15 minutes:
\[15 \times 2 = 30\] balloons are blown by Kris.

After 15 minutes, her brother doubles his speed to \(4\) balloons per minute. For the remaining 15 minutes:
\[15 \times 4 = 60\] balloons are blown by her brother.

Adding the balloons blown by Kris and her brother, we get:

In the first 15 minutes:
- Kris blows up 2 balloons/minute * 15 minutes = 30 balloons.
- Her brother blows up 2 * 2 = 4 balloons/minute for the first 15 minutes.
- So in total, during the first 15 minutes, she and her brother blow up 30 (Kris) + 4 * 15 (Brother) = 90 balloons.

The remaining 15 minutes are after the doubling of her brother’s speed:
- Her brother now blows up 4 * 2 = 8 balloons/minute.
- In the last 15 minutes, Kris's brother blows up 8 balloons/minute * 15 minutes = 120 balloons.

In the last 15 minutes, Kris blows up:
2 balloons/minute * 15 minutes = 30 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons blown up is 90 (first 15 minutes) + 120 (last 15 minutes) + 30 (last 15 minutes) = 240 balloons.

First, let's calculate the number of balloons Kris can blow up in 30 minutes.

Kris blows up a total of 2 balloons per minute. Therefore, in 30 minutes she can blow up:
2 balloons/minute * 30 minutes = 60 balloons

Her brother works twice as fast as Kris. So, in one minute, she brother blows up:
2 balloons/minute * 2 = 4 balloons/minute

For the first 15 minutes, Kris and her brother blow up balloons as follows:
Kris blows up 2 balloons/minute * 15 minutes = 30 balloons
Her brother blows up 4 balloons/minute * 15 minutes = 60 balloons

After 15 minutes, her brother doubles his speed, so he works at 8 balloons per minute.

For the remaining 15 minutes, her brother works at 8 balloons/minute:
8 balloons/minute * 15 minutes = 120 balloons

Thus, after the 30 minutes, her brother blows up an additional 120 balloons.

The total number of balloons blown up by Kris and her brother is the sum of the balloons blown up by each of them:
(Kris's balloons) + (Her brother's balloons before doubling speed) + (Her brother's additional balloons after doubling speed)
= 30 balloons + 60 balloons + 120 balloons
= 210 balloons

So, in total, Kris and her brother blew up 210 balloons after 30 minutes.

To determine the total number of balloons blown up, we need to calculate the number of balloons each person blows up in the two 15-minute intervals.

First, let's calculate the number of balloons Kris blows up:
Kris blows up 2 balloons per minute. Over 30 minutes, she would blow up:
\[ 2 \text{ balloons/minute} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of balloons Kris's brother blows up:
Her brother works at twice the speed of Kris in the first 15 minutes. So, in the first 15 minutes, he blows up:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ balloons/minute} \]
In the next 15 minutes, he doubles his speed, so he blows up:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ balloons/minute} \]
Therefore, over the entire 30 minutes, he blows up:
\[ (4 \text{ balloons/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes}) + (8 \text{ balloons/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes}) = 60 + 120 = 180 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, let's sum the balloons blown up by Kris and her brother:
\[ 60 \text{ balloons} + 180 \text{ balloons} = 240 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons blown up is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of balloons each person blows up over the 30 minutes.

First, let's calculate Kris's contribution:
- Kris blows up 2 balloons per minute.
- Over 30 minutes, she blows up \(2 \times 30 = 60\) balloons.

Next, let's calculate her brother's contribution:
- Kris's brother blows up 2 balloons per minute at the start.
- After 15 minutes, his speed doubles to 4 balloons per minute.
- For the first 15 minutes, he blows up \(4 \times 15 = 60\) balloons.
- For the remaining 15 minutes, he continues at his new speed, so he blows up \(4 \times 15 = 60\) more balloons.

Adding up all the balloons blown up:
