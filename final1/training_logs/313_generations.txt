Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many toys Hash has. According to the problem, Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has.
2. Since Bill has 60 toys, half of Bill's toys would be 60 / 2 = 30.
3. Hash has nine more than half of Bill's toys, so we add 9 to 30 to find out how many toys Hash has: 30 + 9 = 39.
4. Now, to find the total number of toys the boys have, we need to add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has: 60 + 39 = 99.

Therefore, the total number of toys the boys have is 99.

Let's calculate the number of toys Hash has first.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. Since Bill has 60 toys, half of that number is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Hash has nine more than this, so Hash has:

\[ 30 + 9 = 39 \] toys.

Now, to find the total number of toys the boys have together, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has:

\[ 60 + 39 = 99 \] toys.

So, the total number of toys the boys have is 99.

Half as many toys as Bill has is 60 / 2 = 30 toys.
Hash's toys are 9 more than half as many as Bill's, so Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.
The total number of toys that the boys have is 30 + 39 = 69 toys.

If Bill has 60 toys, then half as many toys as Bill would be \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) toys. Adding nine more to this number gives \( 30 + 9 = 39 \) toys for Hash. To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has and the number Hash has, which gives \( 60 + 39 = 99 \) toys in total.

Let's denote the number of toys Bill has as \( B \) and the number of toys Hash has as \( H \).

According to the problem, \( B = 60 \).

We know that Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill. Therefore, we can express this mathematically as:
\[ H = \frac{1}{2}B + 9 \]

Substituting \( B = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ H = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 + 9 \]

Solving this:
\[ H = 30 + 9 \]
\[ H = 39 \]

Now, letâ€™s find the total number of toys they both have:
\[ \text{Total toys} = B + H \]
\[ \text{Total toys} = 60 + 39 \]
\[ \text{Total toys} = 99 \]

So, the total number of toys the boys have is 99.

Let's denote the number of toys Hash has as \( H \) and the number of toys Bill has as \( B \).

Given:
- \( B = 60 \) (Bill's toys)
- Hash has 9 more than half as many toys as Bill.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:
\[ H = \frac{1}{2}B + 9 \]

Substitute \( B \) with 60:
\[ H = \frac{1}{2}(60) + 9 \]
\[ H = 30 + 9 \]
\[ H = 39 \]

So, Hash has 39 toys.

To find the total number of toys they both have:
\[ Total = Bill's\ toys + Hash's\ toys \]
\[ Total = 60 + 39 \]
\[ Total = 99 \]

Therefore, the total number of toys they have is 99.

Let's denote the number of toys Bill has as \( B \) and the number of toys Hash has as \( H \). According to the problem:
- Bill has 60 toys, so \( B = 60 \).
- Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, so \( H = \frac{1}{2}B + 9 \).

We can substitute the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( H \):
\[ H = \frac{1}{2}(60) + 9 \]

Now let's calculate the number of toys Hash has using the value of \( B \).

<answer>
To find out how many toys Hash has, we substitute \( B = 60 \) into the equation \( H = \frac{1}{2}B + 9 \):
\[ H = \frac{1}{2}(60) + 9 \]
\[ H = 30 + 9 \]
\[ H = 39 \]

Now, to find the total number of toys both boys have together, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has:
\[ Total = B + H \]
\[ Total = 60 + 39 \]
\[ Total = 99 \]

The answer is 99.
</answer>
<reasoning>
To solve the problem, let's first determine how many toys Hash has. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, then we can calculate the number of toys Hash has using the given relationship. 

We convert Bill's number of toys to a fraction that matches Hash's expression. Bill's 60 toys can be divided into half and then increased by 9 to find Hash's number of toys. This means we should first calculate 1/2 of 60, which gives 30, and then add 9 to that. 

\[ \text{Number of toys Hash has} = \frac{60}{2} + 9 \]
</reasoning>
<answer>
To find the number of toys Hash has, first calculate half of Bill's 60 toys:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Then, add 9 to this number to get the total:

\[ 30 + 9 = 39 \]

So, Hash has 39 toys.
</answer>
<reasoning>
The problem states that Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill. If Bill has 60 toys, we can calculate the number of toys Hash has by dividing Bill's toys by 2 and then adding 9 to the result. 

Hash's toys can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of toys Hash has} = \frac{60}{2} + 9 \]

Calculating the division:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Adding 9 to this result gives:

\[ 30 + 9 = 39 \]

So, Hash has 39 toys.
</reasoning>
<answer>
The number of toys Bill has is given as 60. Hash has nine more than half of Bill's toys, so we need to calculate:

\[ \text{Number of toys Hash has} = \frac{60}{2} + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of toys Hash has} = 30 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of toys Hash has} = 39 \]

Thus, the total number of toys Bill and Hash have together is:

\[ \text{Total toys} = \text{Bill's toys} + \text

To determine how many toys Hash and Bill have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half the number of toys Bill has.
2. Add 9 to that value to find out how many toys Hash has.
3. Add the number of toys Bill and Hash have together to get the total.

Let's start with the first step:
Bill has 60 toys. Half of Bill's toys is calculated as:
\[
\frac{60}{2} = 30
\]

Next, we add 9 to this value to find out how many toys Hash has:
\[
30 + 9 = 39

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Bill has 60 toys.
2. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill. So if we let \( H \) represent the number of toys Hash has, then \( H = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 + 9 \).
3. Calculating the expression inside the parentheses first, we get \( \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \).
4. Adding nine to this result, we get \( 30 + 9 = 39 \). So, Hash has 39 toys.
5. To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39).

6. The total number of toys is therefore \( 60 + 39 = 99 \).

Reasoning:
To determine the total number of toys that Hash and Bill have, we will first calculate the number of toys Hash has based on the given information, and then we will add it to the number of toys Bill has.

Let's denote the number of toys Bill has as B and the number of toys Hash has as H. According to the problem, Bill has 60 toys, so B = 60. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, so H = 1/2 * B + 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of toys Hash has:

H = 1/2 * B + 9
H = 1/2 * 60 + 9
H = 30 + 9
H = 39

Hash has 39 toys. Now we can calculate the total number of toys:

Total toys = B + H
Total toys = 60 + 39
Total toys = 99

So, the total number of toys that Hash and Bill have is 99.
