To find out how many songs the band will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we first need to determine how many songs they have played so far and how many they have left in their repertoire.

The band has played 5 songs in the first set and 7 songs in the second set, which totals 5 + 7 = 12 songs.

They will play 2 songs for their encore. So, in total, they will play 12 + 2 = 14 songs from their repertoire.

Since they have 30 songs in their repertoire, the number of songs left for the third and fourth sets is 30 - 14 = 16 songs.

If the band plays these 16 songs evenly between the third and fourth sets, the average number of songs they will play per set is 16 / 2 = 8 songs.

To determine how many songs the band will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of songs played so far:**
   - First set: 5 songs
   - Second set: 7 songs
   - Encore: 2 songs

   Total songs played so far = \(5 + 7 + 2 = 14\) songs

2. **Calculate the number of songs remaining in the repertoire:**
   - Total repertoire: 30 songs
   - Songs played so far: 14 songs
   - Songs remaining = \(30 - 14 = 16\) songs

3. **Determine the number of sets left:**
   - Since the band performed in two sets so far and will play for two encores, they have performed \(2 + 2 = 4\) sets in total.
   - Therefore, the number of sets left = \(4 - 2 = 2\) sets.

4. **Calculate the average number of songs per set left if they will still perform in sets:**
   - Total songs remaining: 16 songs
   - Sets left: 2 sets

   Average songs per set = \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\) songs

5. **Determine the average number of songs per set for the third and fourth sets:**
   - Since the band will play through their entire repertoire, the total number of songs to be played remains 30.
   - Total sets to be played: 4 sets (since they have already played 4 sets in total)

   Average songs per set = \(\frac{30}{4} = 7.5\) songs

Therefore, the average number of songs the band will play on average in the third and fourth sets is 7.5 songs per set.

To determine how many songs the band will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we need to calculate the total number of songs already played and the total number of songs remaining in the repertoire.

First, we know the band has a total of 30 songs in their repertoire.

The band has already played 5 songs in the first set and 7 songs in the second set. So, the total number of songs played so far is:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

The band will play 2 songs for their encore, so we need to subtract these from the repertoire to find out how many songs are left:
\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \]

The band will play the remaining 28 songs in the third and fourth sets. Since these two sets are consecutive (assuming no break in the third set), the average number of songs played for the third and fourth sets will be:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Therefore, the band will play 14 songs on average in the third and fourth sets.

To determine the number of songs played in the encore, we first need to find out how many songs are left after the first and second sets. The band's repertoire is 30 songs.

The band played 5 songs in their first set and 7 songs in their second set. The total number of songs played so far is:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Since the total number of songs in the repertoire is 30, the number of songs left for the third and fourth sets is:
\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \]

The band will play 2 songs for their encore. To find out how many songs they will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we calculate the average of the remaining songs:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Thus, the band will play an average of 9 songs on the third and fourth sets.

To find the number of songs the band will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we first need to determine the total number of songs remaining in the repertoire after the first two sets and the encore.

The total number of songs in the repertoire is 30. The band played 5 songs in the first set, 7 in the second set, and 2 for the encore. So, the number of songs remaining is:

\[ 30 - (5 + 7 + 2) = 30 - 14 = 16 \]

These 16 songs will be played in the third and fourth sets. To find the average number of songs played per set, we divide the number of songs by 2 (since the songs are played over two sets):

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Therefore, the band will play 8 songs on average in the third and fourth sets.

To find out how many songs the band will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we need to consider the total number of songs played and the number of sets played.

The band has a total of 30 songs in their repertoire, and they have already played 5 songs in the first set and 7 songs in the second set. Additionally, they will play 2 songs in the encore.

First, let's calculate the total number of songs played so far:
\[ 5 \text{ (first set)} + 7 \text{ (second set)} + 2 \text{ (encore)} = 14 \text{ songs} \]

This means there are \(30 - 14 = 16\) songs remaining to be played.

The band will play these remaining songs in three more sets (third and fourth sets). To find the average number of songs played per set over these three sets, we divide the remaining songs by 3:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ songs}}{3 \text{ sets}} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

So, the band will play approximately 5.33 songs on average in each of the third and fourth sets.

To find out how many songs the band will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we first need to determine how many songs they have left to play after their first two sets and their encore.

1. The band played 5 songs in the first set and 7 songs in the second set. So, they have played a total of \(5 + 7 = 12\) songs.
2. They have 30 songs in their repertoire and will play 2 songs for their encore. Therefore, they have \(30 - 2 = 28\) songs left to play.
3. After their first two sets and encore, the band has \(28 - 12 = 16\) songs left to play in the third and fourth sets.

Since there are \(30 - 12 - 2 = 16\) songs left to play in the third and fourth sets, we divide these by 2 to find the average number of songs they will play in each of these two sets:

\(16 \div 2 = 8\)

So, the band will play 8 songs on average in the third and fourth sets.

To find out how many songs the band will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we need to first determine how many songs are left from the repertoire and then divide by 2 (since there are two sets).

The band has 30 songs in total. They played 5 songs in the first set and 7 in the second set. For their encore, they will play 2 songs.

So, the total number of songs played so far is:
5 (first set) + 7 (second set) + 2 (encore) = 14 songs.

This leaves:
30 - 14 = 16 songs to play in the third and fourth sets combined.

Since the band is playing two sets, the average number of songs per set for the whole set is:
16 / 2 = 8 songs per set.

Therefore, the answer is 8.

To find the number of songs the band will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we need to first determine how many songs they have left after their first two sets and the encore. The band has 30 songs in total.

After their first set, they have played 5 songs, leaving them with 30 - 5 = 25 songs.
After their second set, they have played another 7 songs, leaving them with 25 - 7 = 18 songs.
After their encore, they have played 2 songs, leaving them with 18 - 2 = 16 songs.

The band will play through their entire repertoire, so the third and fourth sets will have the remaining songs.

The average number of songs they will play in the third and fourth sets is the total number of songs they have left divided by 2.

So, the average number of songs they will play in the third and fourth sets is 16 / 2 = 8 songs.

To find out how many songs the band will play in the third and fourth sets, we need to subtract the number of songs already played from the total repertoire and then divide by 2 since the band will play 2 songs each set.

Total repertoire = 30 songs

Songs played in the first set = 5 songs
Songs played in the second set = 7 songs
Songs played in the encore = 2 songs

Total songs played so far = 5 + 7 + 2 = 14 songs

Songs remaining = Total repertoire - Songs played so far = 30 - 14 = 16 songs

Since the band will play 2 songs each in the third and fourth sets, let's calculate the average number of songs played per set:

Average songs per set = Total songs remaining / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 songs

The band will play an average of 8 songs each in the third and fourth sets.

To determine the number of songs played in the third and fourth sets, we first need to calculate the total number of songs played so far, including the encore songs.

The total number of songs in the repertoire is 30. The band has already played:
- 5 songs in their first set
- 7 songs in their second set
- 2 songs for their encore

First, let's add up the songs already played:
\[ 5 + 7 + 2 = 14 \]

Next, we subtract the number of songs already played from the total number of songs in the repertoire to find out how many songs are left to be played:
\[ 30 - 14 = 16 \]

The band will need to play these 16 songs in the third and fourth sets. Since the problem asks for the average number of songs played in these sets, we can find this by dividing the total number of these songs by 2:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Therefore, the band will play an average of 8 songs in the third and fourth sets.

To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of songs they have already played:

- First set: 5 songs
- Second set: 7 songs
- Encore: 2 songs

Total songs played so far = 5 + 7 + 2 = 14 songs.

The band has a repertoire of 30 songs and has already played 14 songs, so they still need to play:

30 - 14 = 16 songs.

The band will play the encore during the third and fourth sets. Assuming they use up exactly 16 songs for the encore by playing 2 songs each set, they will have played:

- Third set: 2 songs
- Fourth set: 2 songs

Total songs played in the third and fourth sets = 2 + 2 = 4 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many songs they will play on average in these two sets. Since each set has 2 songs, the average number of songs they will play in the third and fourth sets is:

4 songs / 2 sets = 2 songs per set.

So, they will play on average 2 songs in the third and fourth sets.

To find the average number of songs the band will play in the third and fourth sets, we first need to calculate the total number of songs played by the end of their second and encore sets. The band played 5 songs in their first set, 7 in their second set, and 2 in their encore. So, the total number of songs played so far is:

\[ 5 + 7 + 2 = 14 \]

The band has only 30 songs in their repertoire, so if they have already played 14 songs, they have 16 songs left to play. Since they will play an equal number of songs in the third and fourth sets (because we are assuming they play through the entire repertoire), we divide the remaining songs by 2 to find out how many they will play in each of these sets:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Therefore, the band will play 8 songs in the third set and 8 songs in the fourth set.

To find the average number of songs they will play on average in the third and fourth sets, we add the number of songs planned for each set and divide by 2:

\[ \frac{8 + 8}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

So, the band will play 8 songs on average in the third and fourth sets.

To find the average number of songs played in the third and fourth sets, we first need to determine the total number of songs played to that point and subtract it from the total number of songs in the repertoire.

The school band has played:
- 5 songs in the first set
- 7 songs in the second set
- 2 songs for the encore

Total songs played so far = 5 + 7 + 2 = 14 songs

Now, to find out how many songs are left to play, we subtract the total songs played so far from the total songs in the repertoire.

Total songs in repertoire = 30
Total songs played so far = 14
Songs left to play = 30 - 14 = 16 songs

Since the band will play through their entire repertoire in 4 sets (3 sets for their main performance and 1 encore), and 16 songs are left to play, we can divide the total songs left by the number of sets remaining to find the average number of songs per set.

Songs per set = Total songs left / Number of sets remaining
             = 16 / 3
             ≈ 5.33

So, the band will play around 5.33 songs on average in the third and fourth sets.
