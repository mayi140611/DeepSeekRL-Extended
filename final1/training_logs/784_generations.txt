To determine how much more money Christopher has compared to Karen, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them has in quarters.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Karen has. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can find the total amount of money Karen has by multiplying the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:
\[ 32 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 \text{ per quarter} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Christopher has in the same way:
\[ 64 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 \text{ per quarter} = \$16.00 \]

Now that we know Christopher has $16.00 and Karen has $8.00, we can determine how much more money Christopher has by subtracting Karen's total from Christopher's total:
\[ \$16.00 - \$8.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, Christopher has $8.00 more than Karen.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Karen has. Since there are 4 quarters in $1, Karen's total amount of money is \( \frac{32}{4} = \$8 \).

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Christopher has. Since there are 4 quarters in $1, Christopher's total amount of money is \( \frac{64}{4} = \$16 \).

Now, to determine how much more money Christopher has compared to Karen, we subtract Karen's total amount from Christopher's total amount:
\( \$16 - \$8 = \$8 \).

So, Christopher has $8 more than Karen.

To find out how much more money Christopher has, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Karen has. Since Karen has 32 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 32 by 0.25.
2. Calculate the amount of money Christopher has. Similarly, since Christopher has 64 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 64 by 0.25.
3. Subtract Karen's total amount of money from Christopher's total amount of money to find out how much more Christopher has.

Let's do the calculations:
- Karen's total: 32 * 0.25 = $8.00
- Christopher's total: 64 * 0.25 = $16.00

Now, subtract Karen's total from Christopher's total:
16.00 - 8.00 = $8.00

Therefore, Christopher has $8.00 more than Karen.

We need to calculate the total amount of money each person has in quarters. To do this, we'll multiply the number of quarters each person has by the value of a quarter (25 cents).

Karen has 32 quarters, so we calculate her total money as follows:
\[ 32 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents} = 800 \text{ cents} \]

Christopher has 64 quarters, so we calculate his total money:
\[ 64 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents} = 1600 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much more money Christopher has compared to Karen, we subtract Karen's total money from Christopher's total money:
\[ 1600 \text{ cents} - 800 \text{ cents} = 800 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents equal one dollar, we convert the difference back to dollars:
\[ 800 \text{ cents} = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Christopher has 8 dollars more than Karen.

To determine how much more money Christopher has compared to Karen, we need to calculate the total value of quarters each of them has and then find the difference.

First, calculate the total value of quarters Karen has:
Karen has 32 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:
\[ 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total value of quarters Christopher has:
Christopher has 64 quarters. Following the same calculation:
\[ 64 \times 0.25 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, find out how much more money Christopher has compared to Karen:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Christopher has $8 more than Karen.

To determine how much more money Christopher has compared to Karen, we begin by noting that each quarter is worth $0.25. 

First, calculate the total value of the quarters each has:

Karen's total value: 
\[ 32 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 \text{ per quarter} = \$8.00 \]

Christopher's total value:
\[ 64 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 \text{ per quarter} = \$16.00 \]

Next, compare the values:

Christopher's total value is $16.00 and Karen's total value is $8.00.

Now, subtract Karen's total from Christopher's total to find out how much more money Christopher has:
\[ \$16.00 - \$8.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, Christopher has $8.00 more than Karen.

First, we need to determine the value of Karen's quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, Karen's 32 quarters are worth 32 * 25 = 800 cents. 

Now, we do the same for Christopher's quarters. His 64 quarters are worth 64 * 25 = 1600 cents.

Finally, to find out how much more money Christopher has, we subtract Karen's amount from Christopher's amount: 1600 - 800 = 800 cents. 

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total amount into dollars: 800 / 100 = $8.

First, we need to determine how much money Karen and Christopher have individually. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so Karen has 32 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $8. Christopher has 64 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $16. Now, we need to determine the difference in their amounts, which is Christopher's amount minus Karen's amount: $16 - $8 = $8.
