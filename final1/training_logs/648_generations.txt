system
To find out how many boxes Tanika sold in total over the two days, we first need to calculate how many boxes she sold on Sunday, which is 50% more than the amount she sold on Saturday.

1. Define the number of boxes sold on Saturday as \( x \).
2. Given \( x = 60 \).
3. Therefore, the number of boxes sold on Sunday is \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).

Let's compute the number of boxes Tanika sold on Sunday:

\[ 1.5x = 1.5 \times 60 \]

\[ 1.5x = 90 \]

So, on Sunday, Tanika sold 90 boxes.

To find the total boxes sold over the two days, we add the number of boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday:

\[ \text{Total boxes sold} = 60 + 90 \]

\[ \text{Total boxes sold} = 150 \]

Therefore, Tanika sold 150 boxes in total over the two days.

To find out how many boxes Tanika sold in total over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday first, and then add that to the number sold on Saturday.

On Sunday, Tanika sold 50% more than what she sold on Saturday. Since she sold 60 boxes on Saturday, on Sunday she sold:

\[ 60 + (50\% \times 60) = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, to find the total number of boxes sold over the two days, we add the number sold on Saturday and Sunday:

\[ 60 \text{ (Saturday)} + 90 \text{ (Sunday)} = 150 \text{ boxes} \]

So, Tanika sold a total of 150 boxes over the two days.

To find out how many boxes Tanika sold over the two days, we first need to calculate the number of boxes she sold on Sunday. On Saturday, she sold 60 boxes. On Sunday, she sold 50% more than Saturday, so we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Sunday sales} = \text{Saturday sales} + (\text{Saturday sales} \times 0.50) \]
\[ \text{Sunday sales} = 60 + (60 \times 0.50) \]
\[ \text{Sunday sales} = 60 + 30 \]
\[ \text{Sunday sales} = 90 \]

Now that we know she sold 90 boxes on Sunday, we can add Sunday's sales to Saturday's sales to get the total number of boxes sold over the two days:

\[ \text{Total sales} = \text{Saturday sales} + \text{Sunday sales} \]
\[ \text{Total sales} = 60 + 90 \]
\[ \text{Total sales} = 150 \]

Therefore, Tanika sold a total of 150 boxes over the two days.

To determine the total number of boxes Tanika sold over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes she sold on each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that on Saturday, Tanika sold 60 boxes.

Next, we need to calculate the number of boxes she sold on Sunday. Since she sold 50% more than on Saturday, we calculate 50% of 60 and add it to 60:

\[ 50\% \times 60 = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \]

So, the number of boxes sold on Sunday is:

\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Now, we add the number of boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday to find the total:

\[ 60 + 90 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of boxes Tanika sold over the two days is:

\[ 150 \]

To find the total number of boxes Tanika sold over the two days, we first need to determine how many boxes she sold on Sunday. We know she sold 60 boxes on Saturday. Therefore, she sold 50% more on Sunday than she did on Saturday. This means she sold an additional \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boxes on Sunday.

Now, we can find the total number of boxes sold by adding the number sold on Saturday and Sunday together. So, the total is \(60 + 30 = 90\) boxes.

To find the total number of boxes Tanika sold over the two days, first calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday, which is 50% more than on Saturday.

On Saturday, Tanika sold 60 boxes. 
50% of 60 boxes is calculated as 0.50 * 60 = 30 boxes.
So, on Sunday, she sold 60 + 30 = 90 boxes.

Now, add the number of boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday to find the total:
Saturday's sales: 60 boxes
Sunday's sales: 90 boxes
Total: 60 + 90 = 150 boxes

Therefore, the total number of boxes Tanika sold over the two days is 150.

To find out how many boxes Tanika sold in total over the two days, we first calculate how many boxes she sold on Sunday. On Sunday, she sold 50% more than on Saturday, so we will calculate 50% of 60 and add it to the original 60 boxes.

50% of 60 is (50/100) * 60 = 30

So, on Sunday, she sold 60 + 30 = 90 boxes.

To find the total sales over the two days, we simply add the number of boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday:

Saturday's sales = 60 boxes
Sunday's sales = 90 boxes
Total sales = Saturday's sales + Sunday's sales
Total sales = 60 + 90
Total sales = 150 boxes

Therefore, Tanika sold a total of 150 boxes over the two days.

To find out the total number of boxes Tanika sold over the two days, we will calculate the number sold on Sunday first.

1. On Saturday, Tanika sold 60 boxes.
2. On Sunday, she sold 50% more than on Saturday. To find out how many more boxes that is, we calculate 50% of 60:
   \[
   50\% \times 60 = 0.50 \times 60 = 30
   \]
   So, she sold 30 more boxes on Sunday than on Saturday.

3. The total number of boxes sold on Sunday is:
   \[
   60 \text{ (Saturday)} + 30 \text{ (more on Sunday)} = 90 \text{ boxes}
   \]

4. To find the total number of boxes sold over the two days, we add the number sold on Saturday to the number sold on Sunday:
   \[
   60 \text{ (Saturday)} + 90 \text{ (Sunday)} = 150 \text{ boxes}

Therefore, the total number of boxes Tanika sold over the two days is 150.

To find out the total number of boxes Tanika sold over the two days, we first need to calculate how many boxes she sold on Sunday. Since she sold 50% more on Sunday than she did on Saturday, we can find this out by calculating 50% of the number of boxes sold on Saturday and then adding that to the number of boxes sold on Saturday.

Number of boxes sold on Saturday = 60
50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30

So, number of boxes sold on Sunday = Number of boxes sold on Saturday + 50% of the number of boxes sold on Saturday
= 60 + 30 = 90

Now, we add the number of boxes sold on Sunday to the number of boxes sold on Saturday to find out the total number of boxes sold over the two days.

Total number of boxes sold = Number of boxes sold on Saturday + Number of boxes sold on Sunday
= 60 + 90 = 150

Therefore, Tanika sold a total of 150 boxes of crackers over the two days.

To find out how many boxes Tanika sold in total over the two days, we can start by calculating the number of boxes she sold on Sunday. 

On Sunday, she sold 50% more than on Saturday. This means she sold 150% of the number of boxes she sold on Saturday.

On Saturday: 60 boxes
On Sunday: 60 boxes * 150% = 60 boxes * 1.5 = 90 boxes

Now we add the number of boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday together to find the total.

Total boxes sold: 60 boxes (Saturday) + 90 boxes (Sunday) = 150 boxes

Therefore, Tanika sold a total of 150 boxes over the two days.

2. Add the number of boxes sold on Saturday to the number of boxes sold on Sunday.

First, we know that Tanika sold 60 boxes on Saturday. On Sunday, she sold 50% more than she did on Saturday. To find out how many boxes she sold on Sunday, we can calculate 50% of 60 and add it to 60:
