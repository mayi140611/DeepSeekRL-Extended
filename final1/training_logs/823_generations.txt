<reasoning>
To determine the total number of people who have to sit in the chairs for the church to be full, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of chairs in the church. Since there are six chairs in each row and 20 rows, the total number of chairs is \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \).
2. Each chair holds five people. Therefore, to find the total number of people who can sit in the church, we multiply the total number of chairs by the number of people each chair can hold. So, \( 120 \times 5 = 600 \).

Thus, 600 people have to sit in the chairs for the church to be full.

<reasoning>
To determine the number of people who can sit in the church when it is full, we start by calculating the total number of chairs. Since there are 6 chairs in each row and 20 rows in total, we multiply the number of chairs per row by the number of rows:

\[ \text{Total chairs} = 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Each chair holds 5 people. Therefore, to find the total number of people that can sit in the church, we multiply the total number of chairs by the number of people each chair can hold:

\[ \text{Total people} = 120 \times 5 = 600 \]

So, 600 people have to sit in the chairs for the church to be full.

For each row, there are 6 chairs and 20 rows, so the total number of chairs is 6 chairs/row * 20 rows = 120 chairs. Each chair holds 5 people, so the total number of people the church can hold is 120 chairs * 5 people/chair = 600 people.

To determine the total number of people who can sit in the church when it is full, we need to calculate the total number of chairs and then multiply that by the number of people each chair can hold.

First, we calculate the total number of chairs in the church:
\[ 6 \text{ chairs/row} \times 20 \text{ rows} = 120 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of people that these chairs can hold:
\[ 120 \text{ chairs} \times 5 \text{ people/chair} = 600 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people who need to sit in the chairs for the church to be full is 600.

To find the total number of people who can sit in the church when it is full, we need to multiply the number of chairs in each row by the number of rows and then by the number of people each chair can hold.

First, calculate the number of chairs in one row: \( 6 \) chairs.
Next, calculate the total number of chairs in the church: \( 6 \) chairs/row \(\times\) \(20\) rows = \(120\) chairs.
Finally, calculate the total number of people: \(120\) chairs \(\times\) \(5\) people/chair = \(600\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the church is \(600\).

To determine the total number of people who can sit in the chairs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of chairs in the church.
2. Multiply the total number of chairs by the number of people each chair can hold.

Let's break it down:

1. **Total number of chairs:**
   - There are 6 chairs in each row.
   - There are 20 rows.

   \[
   \text{Total number of chairs} = 6 \text{ chairs/row} \times 20 \text{ rows} = 120 \text{ chairs}
   \]

2. **Total number of people:**
   - Each chair can hold 5 people.

   \[
   \text{Total number of people} = 120 \text{ chairs} \times 5 \text{ people/chair} = 600 \text{ people}
   \]

Therefore, the church can accommodate 600 people in total.
