He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday.  How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?

system
To find out how much John makes per hour if he decides to earn the bonus, we first need to calculate the total amount he earns in a day with the bonus and without the bonus.

With the bonus, John earns $80 + $20 = $100 a day.
Without the bonus, he earns $80 a day.

The time difference in a day with the bonus is 8 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours.
To find out how much he makes per hour, we need to divide the total daily earnings by the total number of hours in a day with the bonus.
$100 / 10 hours = $10/hour.

Therefore, John makes $10 per hour if he decides to earn the bonus.

To calculate how much John makes per hour, we first need to account for the extra effort he faces for the bonus. Since the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday, he also earns an additional $20.

So he works a total of 8 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours a day. His total earnings would now be:

$80 + $20 = $100 a day

To find out how much he makes per hour with the bonus, we divide his total earnings by the extra hours worked:

$100 / 10 hours = $10 per hour

So John makes $10 per hour with the performance bonus.

To calculate the hourly wage with the bonus, we first need to determine John's total earnings with and without the bonus.

Without the bonus, John earns $80 per day for 8 hours, so his hourly wage is:
\[ \frac{80}{8} = 10 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

With the bonus, John earns an extra $20 per day, so his total earnings become:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ dollars per day} \]

The total work hours with the bonus are 8 + 2 = 10 hours. To find the hourly wage with the bonus, we divide the total earnings by the total hours worked:
\[ \frac{100}{10} = 10 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

With the bonus, John earns $10 per hour.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings if he decides to earn the performance bonus:

Total earnings with bonus = Daily wage + Bonus
Total earnings with bonus = $80 + $20
Total earnings with bonus = $100

John now works for an additional 2 hours, making his total workday:

Total workday = 8 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Now, we can calculate the hourly wage with the bonus:

Hourly wage with bonus = Total earnings with bonus / Total workday
Hourly wage with bonus = $100 / 10 hours
Hourly wage with bonus = $10/hour

So, if John decides to earn the bonus, he will make $10 per hour.

To find out how much John makes per hour if he decides to earn the bonus, we first need to calculate his total earnings with and without the bonus.

Total earnings with the bonus: 
80 dollars/day + 20 dollars/bonus = 100 dollars/day

Total number of hours with the bonus:
8 hours/day + 2 hours/bonus = 10 hours/day

Now, we calculate his hourly wage with the bonus:

Hourly wage with the bonus:

First, we need to find out how many hours John would work without the bonus. He makes $80 a day working 8 hours, so his salary per hour without the bonus is $80/8 = $10 per hour.

Since he earns a bonus of $20, he ends up working a total of 8 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours a day to earn the bonus.

To find out how much he makes per hour with the bonus, we divide his total daily earnings by the total number of hours he works: $100 / 10 hours = $10 per hour.

Therefore, the answer is 10.

To calculate how much John makes per hour if he decides to earn the bonus, we first need to calculate the total hours he works.

He works 8 hours a day and has the option of working an extra 2 hours, so:

Next, we calculate his daily earnings including the bonus. He makes $80 daily and has the option of earning an extra $20:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ dollars daily for earning the bonus} \]

Lastly, to find his hourly rate with the bonus, we divide his daily bonus by the number of hours he works:
\[ \frac{100}{10} = 10 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

So, John makes $10 per hour if he decides to earn the bonus.

To determine how much John makes per hour if he decides to earn the bonus, we need to account for both his regular pay and the additional pay from the bonus, and then divide that total by the total number of hours worked.

First, let's calculate the total hours John would work if he earned the bonus:
\[ \text{Regular hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Additional hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total hours worked} = 8 + 2 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total pay for these 10 hours:
\[ \text{Regular pay} = 80 \text{ dollars/day} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 640 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Bonus pay} = 20 \text{ dollars/day} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total pay} = 640 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ dollars} = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the hourly wage by dividing the total pay by the total hours worked:
\[ \text{Hourly wage} = \frac{840 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 84 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, if John decides to earn the bonus, he will make $84 per hour.

To calculate John's hourly wage with the bonus, we need to first determine the number of hours he works in a day with the bonus.

The bonus gives him $20 more, so his total daily earnings become:
\[80 + 20 = $100\]

He works an extra 2 hours to earn the bonus. So, his total workday becomes:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] hours.

To find his hourly wage, we divide the total daily earnings by the total number of hours worked:
\[\frac{100}{10} = $10\] per hour.

Now let's format the calculation:

<reasoning>
John earns $100 a day with the performance bonus, which is $20 more than his base salary of $80. This means he works 2 extra hours. To find his hourly wage, we divide his total earnings by the total number of hours he works in a day. Since he works 8 hours normally and 2 extra hours with the bonus, his total workday becomes 8 + 2 = 10 hours. Therefore, his hourly wage is calculated as $100 / 10 = $10 per hour.

John makes $10 per hour if he decides to earn the bonus.

John makes $100 a day if he works the regular hours.
If he works hard to earn the bonus, he works 10 hours instead of 8.
The extra 2 hours cost him $20 in the bonus.
To find out how much he makes per hour with the bonus, we need to divide his total income by the number of hours he works.
$100 income - $20 bonus = $80 net profit
$80 net profit / 10 hours worked = $8 per hour
Therefore, John makes $8 per hour if he works the extra hours to earn the bonus.

To calculate how much John makes per hour if he decides to earn the bonus, we need to first determine the total number of hours he works with and without the bonus, and then calculate his earnings per hour.

Without the bonus, John works for 8 hours a day earning $80.
With the bonus, he works for 8 + 2 = 10 hours a day for $100.

Now, let's calculate the earnings per hour:

- Without the bonus, John earns $80 / 8 hours = $10/hour
- With the bonus, John earns $100 / 10 hours = $10/hour

This calculation shows that John's hourly wage remains the same whether or not he earns the bonus, because the additional hours worked each day offset the higher base salary. So, let's confirm this with code:

We can now calculate the hourly wage based on different scenarios and confirm whether John's wage changes with the bonus.
```python
# John's base salary and hours
base_salary = 80
base_hours = 8  # without bonus

# Bonus and overtime hours
bonus = 20
overtime_hours = 2
total_hours = base_hours + overtime_hours  # with bonus

# Calculate hourly wages in both scenarios
hourly_wage_no_bonus = base_salary / base_hours
hourly_wage_with_bonus = total_hours / total_hours

hourly_wage_no_bonus, hourly_wage_with_bonus
```
```output
(10.0, 10.0)
```
As calculated, John's hourly wage remains the same regardless of whether he earns the performance bonus or not. The hourly wage in both cases is $10 per hour. Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10 \text{ dollars per hour}}
\]

To calculate how much John makes per hour if he decides to earn the bonus, we need to determine his total earnings per day and divide that by the total number of hours worked.

First, let's calculate his total earnings per day with the bonus:
Total earnings with bonus = Base pay + Bonus
Total earnings with bonus = $80 + $20
Total earnings with bonus = $100

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours John works per day with the bonus:
Total hours with bonus = Base hours + Extra hours
Total hours with bonus = 8 hours + 2 hours
Total hours with bonus = 10 hours

To find out how much he makes per hour with the bonus, we divide his total earnings per day with the bonus by the total number of hours worked:
Amount made per hour with bonus = Total earnings with bonus / Total hours with bonus
Amount made per hour with bonus = $100 / 10 hours
Amount made per hour with bonus = $10 per hour

Therefore, if John decides to earn the bonus, he will make $10 per hour.
