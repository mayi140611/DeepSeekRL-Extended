system
<reasoning>
Let's denote the current temperature of Addison mountain as \( T \). In one hour, the temperature will decrease to \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the current temperature, so the temperature after one hour will be \( \frac{3}{4} \times T \).

Given that the current temperature is 84 degrees, we can calculate the temperature after one hour as follows:
\[ \text{Temperature after one hour} = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 \]

We can now perform the multiplication to find the decrease in temperature.

\[ \text{Temperature decrease} = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 - 84 \]

Let's calculate this.
</reasoning>
<answer>
\[ \text{Temperature decrease} = 63 - 84 = -21 \]
</answer>
<reasoning>
The temperature decrease is \( -21 \) degrees, which means the temperature will decrease by 21 degrees over the course of one hour.

Let's calculate the temperature decrease step by step:

1. The current temperature of the mountain is 84 degrees.
2. In one hour, the temperature will decrease to \( \frac{3}{4} \) of its current temperature.
3. To find the decreased temperature, multiply the current temperature by \( \frac{3}{4} \):
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \times 0.75 = 63
   \]
4. The temperature decrease will be the difference between the current temperature and the decreased temperature:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the temperature will decrease by 21 degrees.

Let's calculate how much the temperature will decrease in one hour. 

Currently, the temperature is 84 degrees. In one hour, it will decrease to \( \frac{3}{4} \) of its current temperature.

To find the temperature after one hour, we calculate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 84 degrees.

\[ \text{Temperature after one hour} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ = 84 \times 0.75 \]
\[ = 63 \text{ degrees} \]

The temperature will decrease from 84 degrees to 63 degrees in one hour.

To find the temperature decrease, we subtract the final temperature from the initial temperature:

\[ \text{Temperature decrease} = 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the temperature will decrease by 21 degrees in one hour.

Given that Addison mountain's temperature will decrease to \(\frac{3}{4}\) of its current temperature after one hour, and the current temperature is 84 degrees, we first calculate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of 84.
\[
\text{Temperature decrease} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4}
\]

Next, we multiply \(84\) by \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is equivalent to dividing 84 by \(\frac{4}{3}\).
\[
84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \div \frac{4}{3} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
\]

So, the temperature will decrease by 63 degrees.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature decrease from the initial temperature to the temperature after one hour.

1. First, let's find the temperature after one hour. The temperature after one hour is given as \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the initial temperature.
   Initial temperature = 84 degrees
   After one hour = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 \)

2. Let's perform the calculation:
   \[
   \text{After one hour} = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = \frac{3 \times 84}{4} = \frac{252}{4} = 63 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. The temperature decrease is the difference between the initial temperature and the temperature after one hour:
   \[
   \text{Temperature decrease} = \text{Initial temperature} - \text{Temperature after one hour} = 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. By understanding the meaning of the fractions and performing the calculation, we find that after one hour, the temperature will decrease by 21 degrees.

Let's denote the current temperature of the mountain as \( T \). According to the problem, \( T = 84 \) degrees. The temperature will decrease to \( \frac{3}{4} \) of its current temperature in one hour.

The formula to calculate the new temperature is:
\[ T_{\text{new}} = T \times \frac{3}{4} \]

Substituting the current temperature:
\[ T_{\text{new}} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ T_{\text{new}} = 84 \times 0.75 \]
\[ T_{\text{new}} = 63 \]

Now, the temperature decrease can be calculated by subtracting the new temperature from the current temperature:
\[ \text{Decrease} = T - T_{\text{new}} \]
\[ \text{Decrease} = 84 - 63 \]
\[ \text{Decrease} = 21 \]

Therefore, the temperature will decrease by 21 degrees.

Let's denote the current temperature of Addison mountain as \( T_{\text{current}} \) and the temperature after one hour as \( T_{\text{future}} \). According to the information given, \( T_{\text{future}} \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the temperature \( T_{\text{current}} \).

Given that the current temperature of the mountain is 84 degrees, we can set up the following equation:
\[ T_{\text{future}} = \frac{3}{4} \times T_{\text{current}} \]
\[ T_{\text{future}} = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 \]

Now, let's calculate the decrease in temperature.

\[ T_{\text{decrease}} = T_{\text{current}} - T_{\text{future}} \]

\[ T_{\text{decrease}} = 84 - \frac{3}{4} \times 84 \]

\[ T_{\text{decrease}} = 84 - 63 \]

\[ T_{\text{decrease}} = 21 \]

Therefore, Addison mountain will decrease by 21 degrees in temperature.

To determine the temperature decrease, we first need to calculate the temperature after one hour when it will be 3/4 of its current temperature. The current temperature of the mountain is 84 degrees.

The temperature after one hour will be:
\[
84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \text{ degrees}
\]

The initial temperature was 84 degrees and the temperature one hour later will be 63 degrees. To find the temperature decrease, we subtract the final temperature from the initial temperature:
\[
84 - 63 = 21 \text{ degrees}
\]

So, the temperature will decrease by 21 degrees.

To find out how much the temperature will decrease by, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the temperature decrease amount.
2. Calculate the temperature decrease based on the current temperature.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature decrease amount in one hour.
The temperature currently is 84 degrees. In one hour, it will decrease to 3/4 of its current temperature. We set up the equation to find the decrease amount and then subtract this decrease from the current temperature.

The decrease amount can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Decrease in temperature} = 84 - \left(\frac{3}{4} \times 84\right) \]

Step 2: Simplify the equation:
\[ \text{Decrease in temperature} = 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the temperature will decrease by 21 degrees in one hour.

Step 3: Calculate the temperature decrease based on the current temperature.
\[ \text{Temperature decrease per hour} = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 - 84 \]
\[ \text{Temperature decrease per hour} = 63 - 84 \]
\[ \text{Temperature decrease per hour} = -21 \]

Since the temperature is decreasing, the temperature decrease per hour is 21 degrees.

Let's denote the current temperature of the mountain as \( T = 84 \) degrees. In one hour, the temperature will decrease to \( \frac{3}{4} \) of its current temperature. Therefore, the temperature after one hour will be \( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 \).

First, perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 84 = \frac{3 \times 84}{4}
\]

Next, calculate the numerator:
\[
3 \times 84 = 252
\]

Then, divide by the denominator:
\[
252 \div 4 = 63
\]

So, in one hour, the temperature will decrease to \( 63 \) degrees.

To find the temperature decrease, subtract the final temperature from the initial temperature:
\[
84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, the temperature will decrease by \( 21 \) degrees.

To find the temperature decrease, we first need to determine the temperature that will be left after one hour. As per the given information, the temperature will be 3/4 of the current temperature. 

First, we calculate the temperature that will be left after one hour:
\[ \text{Left temperature} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \text{ degrees} \]

The temperature decrease would be the difference between the current temperature and the temperature it will be in one hour:
\[ \text{Temperature decrease} = 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ degrees} \]

This temperature decrease will be distributed equally among the two hours, meaning the temperature will decrease by 10.5 degrees in the first hour and 10.5 degrees in the second hour.

So, to find the total decrease in temperature after one hour:
\[ \text{Total temperature decrease} = 10.5 \text{ degrees} \]

Let's denote the current temperature of Addison mountain as \( T_0 = 84 \) degrees. According to the problem, the temperature decreases to \( \frac{3}{4} \) of its current temperature in one hour. Therefore, the temperature after one hour, \( T_1 \), can be calculated as follows: 

\[ T_1 = T_0 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ T_1 = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

The temperature after one hour will be 63 degrees. To find the temperature decrease, we subtract the temperature after one hour from the current temperature:
