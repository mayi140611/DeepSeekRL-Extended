system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to calculate the new weight of the cow after it increased its weight to 1.5 times its starting weight. The starting weight was 400 pounds, so the new weight is 400 * 1.5 = 600 pounds.

2. In the first step, we were given that John had to sell the cow for $3 per pound. To find the total value of the cow after gaining the weight, we multiply the new weight (600 pounds) by the selling price per pound ($3).

Now, let's calculate the value of the cow after the increase:

600 pounds * $3/pound = $1800

To find out how much more the cow is worth after gaining the weight, we need to calculate the difference between the new value and the old value. The old value of the cow was 400 pounds * $3/pound = $1200.

The difference in value is:

New value - Old value = $1800 - $1200 = $600

Therefore, the cow is worth $600 more after gaining the weight.

Originally, the cow weighs 400 pounds.
The cow's weight increased to 1.5 times its starting weight, which is 400 pounds * 1.5 = 600 pounds.
The cow's weight has increased by 600 pounds - 400 pounds = 200 pounds.
The cow is sold for $3 per pound, so the increase in value is 200 pounds * $3/pound = $600.
Therefore, it is worth $600 more after gaining the weight.

To find out how much more the cow is worth after gaining weight, first multiply the original weight by 1.5 to find the new weight:

\( 400 \text{ pounds} \times 1.5 = 600 \text{ pounds} \)

Now, calculate the difference between the new weight and the original weight:

\( 600 \text{ pounds} - 400 \text{ pounds} = 200 \text{ pounds} \)

Finally, multiply the difference by the price per pound to find the increase in value:

\( 200 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars/pound} = 600 \text{ dollars} \)

So, the cow is worth $600 more after gaining weight.

The cow's starting weight was 400 pounds, and it increased to 1.5 times its starting weight, which is 400 * 1.5 = 600 pounds.
The cow had gained 600 - 400 = 200 pounds.
It was able to sell the cow for 200 * $3 = $600.
The cow's weight increased by 600 - 400 = $200.
The cow's weight increased by 200 * $3 = $600 more after gaining the weight.

The original weight of the cow is 400 pounds. After gaining weight, the cow's weight is increased to 1.5 times its original weight. 

To find the increase in weight, calculate: 
\[ \text{New Weight} - \text{Original Weight} = 1.5 \times 400 - 400 \]

\[ = 600 - 400 \]
\[ = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

The cow's new weight is 600 pounds (since it's $1.5$ times the original weight), and John sells it at $3 per pound. We need to find the increase in sales price due to the weight gain.

\[ \text{Increase in Sales Price} = \text{Increase in Weight} \times \text{Price per Pound} \]
\[ = 200 \times 3 \]
\[ = 600 \]

So the increase in worth is $600.

The increase in worth is $600.

To determine how much more the cow is worth after gaining weight, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cow's new weight after it has increased to 1.5 times its starting weight.
2. Determine the increase in weight.
3. Calculate the increase in value based on the new weight.
4. Compare the increase in value with the increase in weight to find out how much more the cow is worth after gaining the weight.

First, let's find the new weight of the cow:
\[ \text{New weight} = \text{Starting weight} \times 1.5 = 400 \times 1.5 = 600 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the increase in weight:
\[ \text{Increase in weight} = \text{New weight} - \text{Starting weight} = 600 - 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we determine the increase in value based on the new weight:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = \text{Increase in weight} \times \text{Price per pound} = 200 \times 3 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cow is worth \(\boxed{600}\) dollars more after gaining the weight.

The cow originally weighed 400 pounds, but gained 1.5 * 400 = 600 pounds. That makes it weigh a total of 400 + 600 = 1000 pounds.

The cow is now worth 1000 * 3 = $3000 more than it was worth before.

Therefore, the answer is 3000.

To calculate the increase in value, we first need to determine the new weight of the cow and then find the difference in value before and after the increase.

1. The original weight of the cow is 400 pounds.
2. The cow increased its weight to 1.5 times its starting weight, so the new weight is \( 400 \times 1.5 = 600 \) pounds.
3. The increase in weight over the original amount is 200 pounds.
4. The cow was sold for $3 per pound, so the increase in value is \( 200 \times 3 = $600 \).

So, the cow is worth $600 more after gaining the weight.

Before the cow gained weight, it weighed 400 pounds.
To find its new weight after gaining 1.5 times its starting weight: 
400 pounds * 1.5 = 600 pounds

Now we find out how much more money John will get for the cow after gaining the weight:
600 pounds - 400 pounds = 200 pounds

Lastly, find out how much more is it worth after gaining weight:
$3 per pound * 200 pounds = $600

Therefore, the cow is worth $600 more after gaining the weight.

To find out how much more the cow is worth after gaining weight, we first need to calculate the new weight of the cow after the increase.

Starting weight: 400 pounds
Increased weight: 1.5 * 400 = 600 pounds

Now, calculate how much is gained in weight:
Increase in weight = New weight - Starting weight
Increase in weight = 600 pounds - 400 pounds
Increase in weight = 200 pounds

Now that we know the cow increased its weight by 200 pounds, we can calculate how much more it is worth now at $3 per pound.

Additional value = Increase in weight * Price per pound
Additional value = 200 pounds * $3 per pound
Additional value = $600

Therefore, the cow is worth $600 more after gaining weight.
