###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
<reasoning>
The total number of balloons is 200. After about half an hour, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the balloons have blown up, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \) balloons. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. Since 40 balloons had already blown up, twice that number is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) balloons. 

So, the total number of balloons that blow up in the two hour period is \( 40 + 80 = 120 \) balloons. Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is \( 200 - 120 = 80 \) balloons.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 200 balloons in the hot air balloon.
2. After about half an hour, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total number of balloons have blown up. 
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \text{ balloons}
   \]
3. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ balloons}
   \]

So, the total number of balloons that blew up after these two time intervals is:
   \[
   40 + 80 = 120 \text{ balloons}
   \]

Thus, the remaining number of balloons that remain intact in the hot air balloon is:
   \[
   200 - 120 = 80 \text{ balloons}
   \]

First, we need to determine how many balloons have already blown up. Since 1/5 of the total number of balloons has blown up after about half an hour, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \]

So, after half an hour, 40 balloons have blown up. Then, after another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. This means:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

So, after the second hour, an additional 80 balloons have blown up. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons that have blown up. Initially, 40 balloons blew up and then 80 more blew up in the second hour, so:

\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

This means that 120 balloons have blown up in total. Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is:

\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \]

To determine how many balloons remain intact, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 200 balloons.
2. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the balloons have blown up:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \text{ balloons}
   \]
   So after half an hour, 40 balloons have blown up.

3. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ balloons}
   \]

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of blown-up balloons:
   \[
   40 + 80 = 120 \text{ balloons}
   \]

5. To find out how many balloons remain intact, we subtract the total number of blown-up balloons from the initial number of balloons:
   \[
   200 - 120 = 80 \text{ balloons}
   \]

Therefore, 80 balloons remain intact.

Initially, the hot air balloon has 200 balloons. After half an hour, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total balloons have blown up. This means \( \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \) balloons have blown up. At this point, \( 200 - 40 = 160 \) balloons remain intact.

After an additional hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. Since 40 balloons had already blown up, twice that number would be \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) balloons. 

Adding these 80 new balloons to the 40 that had already blown up, the total number of balloons that have blown up is \( 40 + 80 = 120 \). 

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is \( 200 - 120 = 80 \).

Let's denote the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon as \( 200 \).

After half an hour, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total number of balloons have blown up. This means \( \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \) balloons have blown up initially. Therefore, the number of balloons remaining after half an hour is:
\[ 200 - 40 = 160 \]

After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. Since 40 balloons had blown up initially, twice this number would be:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]
Thus, the total number of balloons that have blown up after the additional hour is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]
The number of balloons remaining after this additional hour is:
\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons in the hot air balloon that remain intact is \( 80 \).

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Balloons**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.
2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up. Therefore, 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons blow up after half an hour.
3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up blow up. Twice 40 is 80. So, 80 balloons blow up after the additional hour.
4. **Total Blow-ups**: The total number of balloons that have blown up is 40 (initial) + 80 (after the additional hour) = 120 balloons.
5. **Remaining Balloons**: To find out how many balloons remain intact, we subtract the total blow-ups from the initial number of balloons. 200 - 120 = 80 balloons remain intact.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 200 balloons in the hot air balloon.
2. After half an hour, 1/5 of the balloons have blown up. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \text{ balloons}
   \]
   So, 40 balloons have blown up after half an hour.

3. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. Since 40 balloons had already blown up, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ balloons}
   \]
   So, 80 more balloons blow up after the additional hour.

4. Adding the two scenarios together:
   \[
   40 \text{ (first half hour)} + 80 \text{ (additional hour)} = 120 \text{ balloons}
   \]

5. The total number of balloons that had blown up is 120. Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is:
   \[
   200 \text{ (initial balloons)} - 120 = 80 \text{ balloons}

So, 80 balloons remain intact.

To determine how many balloons remain intact, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of balloons that have blown up after half an hour.
2. Calculate the number of balloons that blow up after another hour, given that it is twice the number that had already blown up.
3. Add the number of balloons blown up at the two stages to find the total number of balloons that have blown up.
4. Subtract the total number of blown-up balloons from the initial total to find the number of balloons that remain intact.

1. After half an hour, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total number of balloons have blown up:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \text{ balloons}
   \]

2. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up blow up:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ balloons}
   \]

3. The total number of balloons that have blown up:
   \[
   40 + 80 = 120 \text{ balloons}

4. The number of balloons that remain intact:
   \[
   200 - 120 = 80 \text{ balloons}

We start by calculating the number of balloons that initially blow up in the first half hour. This is given by \( \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40 \).

After another hour, twice the amount of balloons from the previous calculation also blow up. Thus, the number of balloons that blow up in the second hour is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

The total number of balloons that have blown up is the sum of the two periods: \( 40 + 80 = 120 \). Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is \( 200 - 120 = 80 \).
