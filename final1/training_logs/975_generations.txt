###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A farm is growing corn in 2 fields. One of the fields has 13 full rows of corn cobs, and the other field has 16 full rows of corn cobs. If each row contains 4 corn cobs, how many corn cobs has the farm grown?

<reasoning>
To determine the total number of corn cobs grown by the farm, we need to calculate the number of corn cobs in each field and then sum the results.

For the first field:
- There are 13 full rows.
- Each row contains 4 corn cobs.

\[
13 \text{ rows} \times 4 \text{ corn cobs per row} = 52 \text{ corn cobs}
\]

For the second field:
- There are 16 full rows.
- Each row contains 4 corn cobs.

\[
16 \text{ rows} \times 4 \text{ corn cobs per row} = 64 \text{ corn cobs}
\]

Now, we add the corn cobs from both fields:

\[
52 \text{ corn cobs} + 64 \text{ corn cobs} = 116 \text{ corn cobs}
\]

Therefore, the farm has grown a total of 116 corn cobs.

To find the total number of corn cobs grown, we need to calculate the number of corn cobs in each field and then add them together.

For the first field:
- Rows = 13
- Corn cobs per row = 4
- Corn cobs in the first field = 13 * 4 = 52

For the second field:
- Rows = 16
- Corn cobs per row = 4
- Corn cobs in the second field = 16 * 4 = 64

Now, we add the corn cobs from both fields:
Total corn cobs = Corn cobs from the first field + Corn cobs from the second field
               = 52 + 64
               = 116

So, the farm has grown 116 corn cobs in total.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of corn cobs grown in both fields combined.

For the first field, we have 13 full rows of corn cobs. Since each row contains 4 corn cobs, the number of corn cobs in the first field is:
\[ 13 \text{ rows} \times 4 \text{ corn cobs/row} = 52 \text{ corn cobs} \]

For the second field, we have 16 full rows of corn cobs. Using the same calculation, the number of corn cobs in the second field is:
\[ 16 \text{ rows} \times 4 \text{ corn cobs/row} = 64 \text{ corn cobs} \]

To get the total number of corn cobs grown in both fields, we add the number of corn cobs from each field:
\[ 52 \text{ corn cobs} + 64 \text{ corn cobs} = 116 \text{ corn cobs} \]

Therefore, the farm has grown a total of 116 corn cobs.

To find the total number of corn cobs grown on the farm, we first need to calculate the number of corn cobs in one field and then since the farm has two fields, we will multiply that number by 2.

In the first field, there are 13 rows with 4 corn cobs in each row, so the number of corn cobs in that field is \(13 \times 4\).

In the second field, there are 16 rows with 4 corn cobs in each row, so the number of corn cobs in that field is \(16 \times 4\).

We then add those two numbers to get the total number of corn cobs.

So the total number of corn cobs is \( (13 \times 4) + (16 \times 4) \).

First, we need to calculate the number of corn cobs in each field.

So for the first field:  
\(13 \text{ rows} \times 4 \text{ corn cobs per row} = 52 \text{ corn cobs}\)

For the second field:
- There are 16 rows with 4 corn cobs each.

So for the second field:  
\(16 \text{ rows} \times 4 \text{ corn cobs per row} = 64 \text{ corn cobs}\)

Next, add the total number of corn cobs in both fields:  
\(52 + 64 = 116 \text{ corn cobs}\)

Therefore, the total number of corn cobs grown by the farm is \(116\).

To find the total number of corn cobs grown, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of corn cobs per row for each field, and then add the totals together.

For the first field:
- Number of rows: 13
- Corn cobs per row: 4

For the second field:
- Number of rows: 16

- Total corn cobs in the second field: 16 rows * 4 corn cobs/row = 64 corn cobs

Now, we add the totals together:
52 corn cobs + 64 corn cobs = 116 corn cobs

The farm has grown a total of 116 corn cobs across both fields.

To determine the total number of corn cobs grown on the farm, we need to calculate the number of corn cobs in each field separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of corn cobs in the first field:
- Each row in the first field contains 4 corn cobs.
- There are 13 full rows in the first field.

\[
\text{Corns cobs in first field} = 13 \text{ rows} \times 4 \text{ corn cobs/row} = 52 \text{ corn cobs}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of corn cobs in the second field:
- Each row in the second field also contains 4 corn cobs.
- There are 16 full rows in the second field.

\[
\text{Corns cobs in second field} = 16 \text{ rows} \times 4 \text{ corn cobs/row} = 64 \text{ corn cobs}
\]

Now, we add the number of corn cobs from both fields to find the total:

\[
\text{Total corn cobs} = 52 \text{ corn cobs} + 64 \text{ corn cobs} = 116 \text{ corn cobs}
\]

Therefore, the farm has grown a total of 116 corn cobs.
