To determine the number of actors on the show in 1 hour, let's break down the information given:

1. There can be 5 actors at a time.
2. Each actor is in the show for about 15 minutes.
3. Another 5 actors come in every 15 minutes.

First, let's calculate how many actors are present at any given time. Since there are 5 actors present at a time:

\[ \text{Actors per hour} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/actor}} \times 5 = 20 \text{ actors} \]

Now, since 5 new actors come in every 15 minutes, we can calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 1 hour:

\[ \text{Intervals in 1 hour} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals} \]

Since 5 actors come in every 15 minutes, in 4 intervals:

\[ \text{Total actors in 1 hour} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ actors} \]

So, there are 20 actors on the show in 1 hour.

First, we calculate the total time that 5 actors are in the show:
5 actors * 15 minutes = 75 minutes

Since each set of actors is in the show for 15 minutes, we divide the total time by 15:
75 minutes / 15 minutes = 5 sets of 5 actors.

Therefore, there can be up to 5 actors on the show in one hour.

But there are also 5 actors that entered the show halfway through the hour. So we add these 5 to the initial set of 5 actors:
5 + 5 = 10 actors

Thus, there can be up to 10 actors on the show in one hour.

To determine the number of actors on the show in 1 hour, we need to consider the following:
1. Each group of 5 actors lasts for 15 minutes.
2. There are two groups of 5 actors in an hour.

First, calculate how many 15-minute intervals fit into 1 hour:
\[
\text{Number of 15-minute intervals in 1 hour} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = 4
\]
Since there are two groups of 5 actors in each 15-minute interval, the total number of actors per group is:
\[
4 \text{ groups} \times 5 \text{ actors/group} = 20 \text{ actors}
\]
Therefore, the total number of actors that can be on the show in 1 hour is 20.

In one hour, there are 60 minutes. Each time 5 actors come in and leave, so in 60 minutes, 6 cycles of 5 actors happening will occur. This gives us a total of \(6 \times 5 = 30\) actors in 1 hour. Every actor is in the show for about 15 minutes, so in 1 hour, 30 actors are indeed fitting into the 60-minute period.

First, let's calculate the total duration of one complete cycle of an actor coming into the show and then leaving. In one hour (60 minutes), there will be 4 complete cycles of 15 minutes each:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes per cycle} = 4 \text{ cycles} \]

Since there are 5 actors in one cycle, the total number of actors in one hour is:
\[ 4 \text{ cycles} \times 5 \text{ actors per cycle} = 20 \text{ actors} \]

So, there can be 20 actors on the show in one hour.

To determine how many actors can be on the show in 1 hour, we start by noting the frequency of actors coming into the show. Every 15 minutes, 5 new actors join the show along with the existing 5 actors.

First, let's figure out how many 15-minute intervals there are in 1 hour:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals} \]

Since 5 actors enter the show every interval, in 4 intervals, 5 actors will enter:
\[ 5 \text{ actors/interval} \times 4 \text{ intervals} = 20 \text{ actors} \]

Initially, there are also 5 actors in the show. Therefore, the total number of actors on the show in 1 hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ actors} + 5 \text{ actors} = 25 \text{ actors} \]

Thus, 25 actors can be on the show in 1 hour.

In one hour, there are 60 minutes. Each sequence of actors lasts for 30 minutes (since 5 actors are in the show for 15 minutes, leaving a 15-minute break). Therefore, during each hour, you can have 2 sequences of actors (since \(60 \div 30 = 2\)).

Since each sequence includes 5 actors, the total number of actors in one hour is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

So, in 1 hour, there can be a maximum of 10 actors on the show.

To determine how many actors can be on a show in 1 hour, first we need to calculate how many 15-minute cycles fit into an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and each actor takes 15 minutes, 60 minutes / 15 minutes/actor = 4 actors in each 15-minute cycle.

Now, we know that every time there are 5 actors on the show, but not all 5 get to use the 4 cycles available in an hour. The last cycle will not be fully used because 5 actors * 4 cycles = 20 minutes, and there are only 60 minutes in an hour. The last actor will come in at the end of the last cycle, but no additional cycles will be available in the next segment of time.

So, the total number of actors that can be present in one hour is determined by the number of complete cycles within an hour. Since every cycle has 5 actors but the last cycle is not fully used, we need to count only the 4 cycles within an hour.

Therefore, the total number of actors in one hour is 4 cycles * 5 actors per cycle = 20 actors.

To determine the number of actors on the show in one hour, we need to consider the rotation of the actors.

1. In each 15-minute interval, 5 actors come on and 5 actors leave, maintaining a constant number of actors on the show at any given time.
2. Since the show lasts for 60 minutes, we need to figure out how many 15-minute intervals fit into 60 minutes.

\[ \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals} \]

Therefore, 4 sets of 5 actors enter the show, maintaining the stable number of actors throughout the hour.

3. Since 4 sets of 5 actors come on, the total number of actors on the show in one hour is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ actors} \]

In an hour, there are 60 minutes. If each group of actors (5 actors for 15 minutes) occupies 15 minutes, then in one hour there are 60 / 15 = 4 such groups.

Since each group has 5 actors, 4 groups in an hour would have 4 * 5 = 20 actors.

However, we need to check if there are any overlaps or interruptions in the schedule that could affect the count. The problem specifies that actors enter every 15 minutes. In 1 hour, there would be 60 / 15 = 4 intervals of actor entry and departure. Each interval of 15 minutes has 5 actors entering and 5 actors leaving, so the net change per interval is 5 - 5 = 0 actors entering or leaving in a 15-minute interval.

Since all 4 intervals are independent of each other, and each interval results in 0 changes in the count of actors, the total number of actors in the show in an hour is 20.

Therefore, there can be 20 actors on the show in 1 hour.

To determine how many actors can be on the show in one hour, we need to consider the number of actors that enter the show every 15 minutes. 

1. **Initial Setup**: There are 5 actors in the show initially.
2. **Every 15 Minutes**: After 15 minutes, another 5 actors join the show.
3. **Duration of the Show**: The show takes an hour, which is 60 minutes.

First, calculate how many 15-minute intervals fit into 60 minutes:
\[ \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals} \]

Next, compute the total number of actors involved in these 4 intervals:
\[ \text{Total number of actors} = \text{Initial actors} + (\text{Initial number of actors} \times \text{Number of intervals}) \]
\[ \text{Total number of actors} = 5 + (5 \times 4) \]
\[ \text{Total number of actors} = 5 + 20 = 25 \]

Therefore, the show can have 25 actors on it in one hour.

To determine how many actors can be on the show in 1 hour, we need to consider the interval at which the actors change.

1. Each time interval consists of 5 actors being in the show for 15 minutes.
2. This means that the show has a cycle of 5 actors * 15 minutes = 75 minutes.
3. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we calculate how many such intervals fit into 1 hour:
   60 minutes / 75 minutes = 0.8 intervals.
4. Since partial intervals are not possible, we take the whole number part.

Thus, in 1 hour, the show can have 0 complete intervals, which means no actors will complete a full 75-minute cycle.
5. However, the question specifically asks for the number of actors, and since none of the actors are completing a full cycle, the answer is that there are zero actors on the show in one hour.

Therefore, the number of actors that can be in the show in 1 hour is 0.

To determine the total number of actors on the show in 1 hour, we need to consider the frequency at which the number of actors changes.

1. **Current Actors**: At any given time, there are 5 actors on the show.
2. **Actor Entering**: After each group of 5 actors, 5 more actors come on the show.
3. **Total Time**: The show operates for 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.

First, we calculate how many times the group of 5 actors comes into the show in 1 hour:

\[
\text{Number of 5-actor groups in 60 minutes} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes per group}} = 4 \text{ groups}
\]

Each group consists of 5 actors. Therefore, the total number of actors that would be on the show during each of these 4 groups is:

\[
5 \text{ actors per group} \times 4 \text{ groups} = 20 \text{ actors per group}
\]

Adding the initial 5 actors:

\[
20 \text{ actors} + 5 \text{ actors} = 25 \text{ actors}
\]

So, there can be 25 actors on the show in 1 hour.

To determine how many actors can be on the show in one hour, we need to first calculate how many groups of 5 actors can fit into one hour.

Since each group consists of 5 actors and they each perform for some period (though the period is not specified in the question, we can assume it's a unit time for this calculation), we divide 60 minutes (the total time in an hour) by 15 minutes (the time each actor performs).

So, \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \) groups of 5 actors can fit into one hour.

Thus, the total number of actors that can be on the show in one hour is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \).

Next, determine the total number of actors:

First, we need to determine how many 15-minute intervals fit into one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, we divide 60 by 15 to find the number of intervals:
\[ 60 \div 15 = 4 \]
This means that one hour has 4 equal 15-minute intervals. Since there are 5 actors in each interval, this pattern continues for 4 intervals. Therefore, 4 intervals times 5 actors per interval gives us:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
So, there can be a total of 20 actors in one hour.

Second, for each 15-minute interval, 5 new actors come in, resulting in a total of 9 actors per interval (5 actors leaving and 5 new ones entering).

Third, since the show is supposed to be entertaining and engaging, the intervals of 15 minutes may be interspersed with brief breaks or scenes that do not involve actors. However, without additional information about the total number of actors or the duration of those breaks, we are considering the maximum number of actors that can be on the show in 1 hour based on the given conditions.

So, with 4 15-minute intervals, and each interval containing 5 actors entering, the maximum number of actors on the show in one hour is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
