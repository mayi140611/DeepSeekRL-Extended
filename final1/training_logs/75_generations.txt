system
To calculate the total cost of Dale and Andrew's breakfast, we need to add up the cost of their individual items.

Dale's breakfast: 
- 2 slices of toast at £1 each = 2 \times £1 = £2
- 2 eggs at £3 each = 2 \times £3 = £6
- Total for Dale = £2 + £6 = £8

Andrew's breakfast:
- 1 slice of toast at £1 = 1 \times £1 = £1
- 2 eggs at £3 each = 2 \times £3 = £6
- Total for Andrew = £1 + £6 = £7

Total cost for both breakfasts:
- Dale's total + Andrew's total = £8 + £7 = £15

Therefore, the total cost of their breakfast was £15.

To calculate the total cost of their breakfast, we need to sum up the costs for each item that Dale and Andrew had.

Dale's breakfast:
- 2 slices of toast: 2 * £1 = £2
- 2 eggs: 2 * £3 = £6

Andrew's breakfast:
- 1 slice of toast: 1 * £1 = £1
- 2 eggs: 2 * £3 = £6

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Dale's toast: £2
- Dale's eggs: £6
- Andrew's toast: £1
- Andrew's eggs: £6

Total cost = (£2 + £6) + (£1 + £6) = £8 + £7 = £15

Therefore, their breakfast cost £15 in total.

To calculate the total cost of Dale's breakfast, we multiply the number of slices of toast by the cost per slice:
2 * £1/slice = £2

To calculate the total cost of Andrew's breakfast, we multiply the number of slices of toast by the cost per slice and then add the cost of the two eggs:
1 * £1/slice = £1
2 * £3/egg = £6
£1 (for the toast) + £6 (for the eggs) = £7

To calculate the total cost of their breakfast combined, we add the cost of Dale's breakfast and the cost of Andrew's breakfast:
£2 (Dale's toast) + £7 (Andrew's toast and eggs) = £9

Therefore, their breakfast cost £9 in total.

To determine the total cost of Dale and Andrew's breakfast, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate Dale's breakfast cost:**
   - Dale had 2 slices of toast.
   - Dale had 2 eggs.
   - The cost of a slice of toast is £1.
   - The cost of an egg is £3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for Dale is:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices of toast} \times £1/\text{slice} + 2 \text{ eggs} \times £3/\text{egg} = £2 + £6 = £8
     \]

2. **Calculate Andrew's breakfast cost:**
   - Andrew had 1 slice of toast.
   - Andrew had 2 eggs.
   - Therefore, the total cost for Andrew is:
     \[
     1 \text{ slice of toast} \times £1/\text{slice} + 2 \text{ eggs} \times £3/\text{egg} = £1 + £6 = £7
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of their breakfast:**
   - Dale's cost: £8
   - Andrew's cost: £7
   - Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     £8 + £7 = £15
     \]

Thus, the total cost of their breakfast is £15.

reason
To calculate the total cost of their breakfast, we need to sum the cost of the items each person ordered.

- Dale's breakfast:
  - 2 slices of toast: 2 × £1 = £2
  - 2 eggs: 2 × £3 = £6
  - Total for Dale: £2 + £6 = £8

- Andrew's breakfast:
  - 1 slice of toast: 1 × £1 = £1
  - 2 eggs: 2 × £3 = £6
  - Total for Andrew: £1 + £6 = £7

Now we add these amounts together to get the total cost.

- Total cost: £8 (Dale) + £7 (Andrew) = £15

Therefore, their breakfast cost £15 in total.

First, let's calculate the cost of Dale's breakfast.

Dale had 2 slices of toast, and each slice costs £1, so the cost for the toast is:
2 slices × £1/slice = £2

Dale also had 2 eggs, and each egg costs £3, so the cost for the eggs is:
2 eggs × £3/egg = £6

Adding these together, Dale's breakfast cost:
£2 (toast) + £6 (eggs) = £8

Now, let's calculate the cost of Andrew's breakfast.

Andrew had 1 slice of toast, and each slice costs £1, so the cost for the toast is:
1 slice × £1/slice = £1

Andrew also had 2 eggs, and each egg costs £3, so the cost for the eggs is:
2 eggs × £3/egg = £6

Adding these together, Andrew's breakfast cost:
£1 (toast) + £6 (eggs) = £7

Finally, let's add the costs of Dale's and Andrew's breakfast to find the total cost:
Dale's breakfast cost + Andrew's breakfast cost = £8 + £7 = £15

Therefore, their breakfast cost £15 in total.

<answer>
Dale's breakfast cost £8 and Andrew's breakfast cost £7. Their breakfast cost £15 in total.

To calculate the total cost of their breakfast, we need to consider the individual costs and the quantities each person consumed.

1. Dale's breakfast cost: 
   - 2 slices of toast = 2 slices * £1/slice = £2
   - 2 eggs = 2 eggs * £3/egg = £6
