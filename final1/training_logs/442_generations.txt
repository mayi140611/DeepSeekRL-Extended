To determine how much Sab and Dane will each earn, we first need to calculate the total earnings from the shoes and the shirts.

The total earnings from the shoes are:
\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times \$3 \text{ per pair} = \$18 \]

The total earnings from the shirts are:
\[ 18 \text{ shirts} \times \$2 \text{ per shirt} = \$36 \]

The combined total earnings from both the shoes and the shirts are:
\[ \$18 + \$36 = \$54 \]

Since Sab and Dane will divide the total earnings equally, each of them will earn:
\[ \frac{\$54}{2} = \$27 \]

First, calculate the total earnings from the shoes: $3 \times 6 = $18. Then, calculate the total earnings from the shirts: $2 \times 18 = $36. Add the earnings from both to get the total earnings: $18 + $36 = $54. Divide the total earnings by 2 to find out how much each will earn: $54 \div 2 = $27.

To determine how much Sab and Dane will each earn, we first calculate the total earnings from selling the shoes and shirts.

The cost of 6 pairs of shoes is \(6 \times 3 = 18\) dollars.
The cost of 18 shirts is \(18 \times 2 = 36\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total earning:
\[18 + 36 = 54\] dollars.

Since the total earning is split equally between Sab and Dane, each of them will earn:
\[54 \div 2 = 27\] dollars.

To find out how much each will earn, let's calculate the total earnings from the shoes and shirts first.

From the shoes, they sold 6 pairs at $3 each:
\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times \$3/\text{pair} = \$18 \]

From the shirts, they sold 18 shirts at $2 each:
\[ 18 \text{ shirts} \times \$2/\text{shirt} = \$36 \]

Now, let's add these amounts together to get the total earnings:
\[ \$18 + \$36 = \$54 \]

Since Sab and Dane will divide this total amount, we simply divide the total earnings by 2 to find out how much each will earn:
\[ \$54 \div 2 = \$27 \]

Therefore, each of them will earn \$27.

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from the shirts:
\[ 18 \text{ shirts} \times \$2 \text{ per shirt} = \(36 \]

Now, let's find the total earnings for both Sab and Dane by adding the earnings from the shoes and shirts:
\[ \$18 \text{ (shoes)} + \$36 \text{ (shirts)} = \$54 \]

Since both Sab and Dane will divide the total earning equally, we divide by 2:
\[ \$54 \div 2 = \$27 \]

Therefore, each of them will earn \$27.

system
To find out how much Sab and Dane will each earn from selling shoes and shirts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total earnings from selling the shoes:
   - Each pair of shoes costs $3.
   - They sold 6 pairs of shoes.
   - Total earnings from shoes = 6 pairs * $3/pair = $18.

2. Calculate the total earnings from selling the shirts:
   - Each shirt costs $2.
   - They sold 18 shirts.
   - Total earnings from shirts = 18 shirts * $2/shirt = $36.

3. Find the total earnings by adding the earnings from shoes and shirts:
   - Total earnings = $18 (from shoes) + $36 (from shirts) = $54.

4. Divide the total earnings equally between Sab and Dane:
   - Total earnings for both = $54.
   - Split the earnings = $54 / 2 = $27.

So, each of them will earn $27.

To determine how much Sab and Dane will each earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sales of shoes and shirts separately, and then divide the total revenue fairly between them.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the shoes:
- They sold 6 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $3.

\[
\text{Total revenue from shoes} = 6 \text{ pairs} \times \$3 \text{ per pair} = \$18
\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the shirts:
- They sold 18 shirts.
- Each shirt costs $2.

\[
\text{Total revenue from shirts} = 18 \text{ shirts} \times \$2 \text{ per shirt} = \$36
\]

Now, let's find the total earnings by adding the revenue from the shoes and the shirts:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \$18 + \$36 = \$54
\]

Since Sab and Dane will divide the total earnings equally, we divide the total earnings by 2:

\[
\text{Earnings for each} = \frac{\$54}{2} = \$27
\]

Therefore, each of them will earn \$27.

To determine how much Sab and Dane will each earn, we need to first calculate the total earnings from the shoes and shirts, and then divide the total earnings by 2 (since they are dividing the money equally).

1. Calculate the total earnings from the shoes:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from shoes} = \text{Number of pairs of shoes} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total earnings from the shirts:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from shirts} = \text{Number of shirts} \times \text{Cost per shirt} = 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the total earnings from both items:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total earnings from shoes} + \text{Total earnings from shirts} = 18 + 36 = 54 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Divide the total earnings by 2 to find out how much each person will earn:

To calculate the total earnings, we first need to determine the total cost of the shoes and shirts.

Total cost of shoes = Number of shoes * Cost per shoe
Total cost of shoes = 6 * $3 = $18

Total cost of shirts = Number of shirts * Cost per shirt
Total cost of shirts = 18 * $2 = $36

Total earnings = Total cost of shoes + Total cost of shirts
Total earnings = $18 + $36 = $54

If Sab and Dane divide their total earnings, each will earn:

Earnings per person = Total earnings / 2
Earnings per person = $54 / 2 = $27

Reasoning:

To find out how much Sab and Dane will each earn, we first need to calculate the total earnings from the shoes and shirts they sold.

1. Calculate the total earnings from the shoes:
   - They sold 6 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $3.
   - Total earnings from shoes = 6 pairs × $3/pair = $18.

2. Calculate the total earnings from the shirts:
   - They sold 18 shirts.
   - Each shirt costs $2.
   - Total earnings from shirts = 18 shirts × $2/shirt = $36.

3. Calculate the total earnings from both items:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from shoes + Earnings from shirts = $18 + $36 = $54.

4. Since Sab and Dane are dividing the total earnings equally, we divide the total earnings by 2:
   - Total earnings per person = Total earnings ÷ 2 = $54 ÷ 2 = $27.

Therefore, each of them will earn $27.

To calculate how much Sab and Dane will each earn, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total earnings from shoes:**
   - Number of shoes sold = 6 pairs
   - Cost per shoe = $3
   - Total earnings from shoes = Number of shoes sold * Cost per shoe
   - Total earnings from shoes = 6 pairs * $3 per pair = $18

2. **Calculate total earnings from shirts:**
   - Number of shirts sold = 18 shirts
   - Cost per shirt = $2
   - Total earnings from shirts = Number of shirts sold * Cost per shirt
   - Total earnings from shirts = 18 shirts * $2 per shirt = $36

3. **Calculate total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Total earnings from shoes + Total earnings from shirts
   - Total earnings = $18 (shoes) + $36 (shirts) = $54

4. **Divide total earnings between Sab and Dane:**
   - Since they are dividing equally, half of $54 is:
   - Earnings per person = Total earnings / 2
   - Earnings per person = $54 / 2 = $27

**Answer:**
Each of them will earn $27.
