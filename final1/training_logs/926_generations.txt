<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of apples each woman bought as x. According to the problem, each man bought 30 apples, which is 20 less than the number of apples bought by each woman. Therefore, we can write the equation:

30 = x - 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 30 + 20 = 50

So, each woman bought 50 apples. The two men bought 30 apples each, so together they bought 2 * 30 = 60 apples. 

The three women bought 3 * 50 = 150 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples bought is the sum of the apples bought by the men and the women:

60 (for the men) + 150 (for the women) = 210 apples.

Thus, the total number of apples bought by the two men and three women is 210.

First, let's determine the number of apples each woman bought. According to the information, each woman bought 20 apples more than each man did. Since each man bought 30 apples, each woman bought \(30 + 20 = 50\) apples. The two men bought a total of \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples. Combining these, the two men and three women purchased \(60 + 3 \times 50 = 60 + 150 = 210\) apples.

Let's denote the number of apples each woman bought as \( x \). According to the problem, each man bought 30 apples, which is 20 less than the number of apples each woman bought. So, we can write \( 30 = x - 20 \). Solving for \( x \) gives us \( x = 50 \). 

Now, if each woman bought 50 apples and there are three women, the total number of apples bought by the women is \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \). 

Since there are two men, and each bought 30 apples, the total number of apples bought by the men is \( 30 \times 2 = 60 \).

Therefore, the total number of apples bought by two men and three women is \( 60 + 150 = 210 \).

Let's denote the number of apples bought by each woman as \( x \). According to the problem, each man bought 30 apples, which is 20 less than the number of apples bought by each woman. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x - 20 = 30 \]
Adding 20 to both sides of the equation gives us:
\[ x = 50 \]
So, each woman bought 50 apples. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples bought by the women:
\[ 3 \text{ women} \times 50 \text{ apples per woman} = 150 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apples bought by the men:
\[ 2 \text{ men} \times 30 \text{ apples per man} = 60 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we add the apples bought by the men and the women to find the total number of apples bought:
\[ 60 \text{ apples} + 150 \text{ apples} = 210 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples bought is 210.

Let's denote the number of apples bought by each woman as \( W \).

From the information given:
- The two men each bought 30 apples.
- Each woman bought 20 more apples than each man.

So for each woman:
\[ W = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

Adding the apples bought by the two men and three women:
\[ 2 \times 30 + 3 \times 50 = 60 + 150 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of apples bought is 210.

Let's define the variables:
Let \( m \) represent the number of apples bought by one man.
Let \( w \) represent the number of apples bought by one woman.

According to the problem, each man bought 30 apples:
\[ m = 30 \]

Each man bought 20 less than the number of apples bought by each woman:
\[ m = w - 20 \]

Substituting \( m \) with 30, we get:
\[ 30 = w - 20 \]

To find \( w \), we solve the equation:
\[ w = 30 + 20 \]
\[ w = 50 \]

So, each woman bought 50 apples.

Now we need to calculate the total number of apples bought by two men and three women:
\[ \text{Total apples} = 2m + 3w \]

Substituting \( m = 30 \) and \( w = 50 \):
\[ \text{Total apples} = 2(30) + 3(50) \]
\[ \text{Total apples} = 60 + 150 \]
\[ \text{Total apples} = 210 \]

Therefore, the men and women bought a total of 210 apples.

Let's denote the number of apples each woman bought as W. According to the problem, each woman bought 20 more apples than each man, which bought 30 apples. Therefore, we can write the equation:

W = 30 + 20

Solving for W:

W = 50

Now, we know that each man bought 30 apples and there are two men, so the total number of apples bought by the men is:

2 men * 30 apples/man = 60 apples

We also know that each woman bought 50 apples and there are three women, so the total number of apples bought by the women is:

3 women * 50 apples/woman = 150 apples

Now, we can find the total number of apples bought by all the individuals:

Total apples = (60 apples from men) + (150 apples from women)

Total apples = 60 + 150
Total apples = 210

So, the two men and three women bought a total of 210 apples.

Let's denote the number of apples bought by each woman as \( W \).

According to the problem, each man bought 30 apples, which is 20 less than what each woman bought. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 30 = W - 20 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = 30 + 20 \]
\[ W = 50 \]

So each woman bought 50 apples.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples bought by the two men:

\[ Number\ of\ apples\ bought\ by\ 2\ men = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of apples bought by the three women:

\[ Number\ of\ apples\ bought\ by\ 3\ women = 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Finally, we add the total number of apples bought by both men and women:

\[ Total\ apples = Number\ of\ apples\ bought\ by\ 2\ men + Number\ of\ apples\ bought\ by\ 3\ women \]
\[ Total\ apples = 60 + 150 \]
\[ Total\ apples = 210 \]

So, the total number of apples bought by the two men and three women is 210.

To determine the total number of apples bought by the two men and three women, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Each of the two men bought 30 apples.
   - Total apples bought by men = 2 × 30 = 60 apples.

2. Each woman bought 20 more apples than each man, which means each woman bought 30 + 20 = 50 apples.
   - Total apples bought by three women = 3 × 50 = 150 apples.

3. To find the total number of apples bought by both groups, we add the apples bought by the men and the apples bought by the women.
   - Total apples bought = 60 (men) + 150 (women) = 210 apples.
