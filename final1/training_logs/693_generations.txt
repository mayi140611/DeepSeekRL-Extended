<reasoning>
Joey studies for 2 hours per night for 5 nights a week, which amounts to $2 \times 5 = 10$ hours of study per week. On the weekends, he studies 3 hours a day for 2 days, which is $3 \times 2 = 6$ hours.

Thus, his total weekly study time is $10 + 6 = 16$ hours. He has 6 weeks until the SAT exam, so his total study time will be $16 \times 6 = 96$ hours.

Joey studies 2 hours per night for 5 nights a week, which means he studies \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours in a week. On the weekends, he studies 3 hours a day, which means he studies \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hours in a week. Thus, in total, he spends \(10 + 6 = 16\) hours studying in a week. Since his SAT exam is 6 weeks away, Joey will study \(16 \times 6 = 96\) hours in total.

Joey studies for 2 hours per night for 5 nights a week. So, he studies 2 hours/night * 5 nights/week = 10 hours per week during the weekdays.
On the weekends, he studies 3 hours per day, so he studies 3 hours/day * 2 days/week = 6 hours per week during the weekends.
Therefore, Joey studies a total of 10 hours/week + 6 hours/week = 16 hours/week.

Since Joey's SAT exam is 6 weeks away, he will spend 16 hours/week * 6 weeks = 96 hours studying.

Joey studies for 2 hours per night, 5 nights a week, which means he studies \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours a week due to the weekdays. On weekends, he studies for 3 hours a day, which is a total of \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hours a week for the weekends.

So, in one week, Joey studies a total of \(10 + 6 = 16\) hours.

To determine the total amount of time Joey will spend studying, we need to calculate his study time during the weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum these values.

1. **Weekday Study Time:**
   Joey studies 2 hours per night for 5 nights a week.
   - Total weekday study time = 2 hours/night * 5 nights/week = 10 hours/week

2. **Weekend Study Time:**
   On the weekends, Joey studies 3 hours a day. Since there are 2 days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), we need to calculate the study time for one weekend and then double it.
   - Total weekend study time = 3 hours/day * 2 days/week = 6 hours/week
   - Joey will have 2 weekends, so = 6 hours/week * 2 weekends = 12 hours

3. **Total Study Time:**
   Summing the weekday and weekend study times gives us the total study time.
   - Total study time = 10 hours/week + 12 hours = 22 hours

Joey studies for his SAT exams 2 hours per night 5 nights a week. This amounts to \(2 \text{ hours/night} \times 5 \text{ nights/week} = 10 \text{ hours/week}\) during the weekdays.

On the weekends, Joey studies 3 hours a day. Since there are 2 days in the weekend, this amounts to \(3 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 6 \text{ hours/week}\) during the weekends.

We need to calculate the total study time for the whole week: \(10 \text{ hours/week} + 6 \text{ hours/week} = 16 \text{ hours/week}\).

Since the SAT exam is 6 weeks away, Joey will spend \(16 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 96 \text{ hours}\) studying.

To determine the total amount of time Joey will spend studying over the 6 weeks, we need to calculate the time he studies during the weekdays and the weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

For the weekdays:
- Joey studies 2 hours per night for 5 nights a week.
- \( 2 \text{ hours/night} \times 5 \text{ nights/week} = 10 \text{ hours/week} \).
- Over 6 weeks, the total time spent studying during the weekdays is: \( 10 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 60 \text{ hours} \).

For the weekends:
- Joey studies 3 hours each day on weekends.
- Since there are 2 days in the weekend, the total time spent studying on the weekends is: \( 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/weekend} \times 6 \text{ weekends} = 36 \text{ hours} \).

Adding the time spent studying during the weekdays and the weekends:
- Total time spent studying: \( 60 \text{ hours} + 36 \text{ hours} = 96 \text{ hours} \).

To calculate the total time Joey will spend studying, we need to break it down into two parts: his regular weekday study time and his weekend study time.

1. **Weekday Study Time**:
   Joey studies 2 hours per night, 5 nights a week. Therefore:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours/night} \times 5 \text{ nights/week} = 10 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

2. **Weekend Study Time**:
   Joey studies 3 hours per day on the weekends. Since there are 2 days in a weekend, his total weekend study time is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/weekend} = 6 \text{ hours/weekend}
   \]

3. **Total Study Time**:
   To find the total time Joey will spend studying over 6 weeks, we add the weekday and weekend study times:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} + 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 60 \text{ hours} + 36 \text{ hours} = 96 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, Joey will spend 96 hours studying for his SAT exams over 6 weeks.

Joey studies 2 hours per night for 5 nights a week, which totals to \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours. On the weekends, he studies 3 hours a day, and since there are 2 days in the weekend, the total for the weekends is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hours. Therefore, the total weekly study time is \(10 + 6 = 16\) hours.

If the SAT exam is 6 weeks away, Joey will spend \(16 \times 6 = 96\) hours studying.

Now, let's calculate the total study time for the whole duration of the exam period.

To calculate the total amount of time Joey will spend studying, we need to break down his study schedule and then sum it up.

First, let's calculate his study time during the weekdays. He studies 2 hours per night for 5 nights a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/night} \times 5 \text{ nights/week} = 10 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, let's calculate his study time during the weekends. He studies 3 hours per day for 2 days a weekend, so:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/weekend} = 6 \text{ hours/weekend} \]

Now, let's add the weekday and weekend study times to find the total study time per week:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/week} + 6 \text{ hours/weekend} = 16 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since Joey has 6 weeks left until his SAT exam, we need to multiply the weekly study time by the number of weeks:
\[ 16 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 96 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Joey will spend 96 hours studying.

To calculate the total study time, we first need to calculate the amount of time Joey studies per week and then multiply by the number of weeks until his exam.

During the weekdays (Monday to Friday):
\[ 2 \, \text{ hours/night} \times 5 \, \text{nights/week} = 10 \, \text{ hours/week} \]

On weekends:
\[ 3 \, \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \, \text{ days/weekend} = 6 \, \text{ hours/week} \]

In 1 week, Joey studies:
\[ 10 \, \text{ hours} + 6 \, \text{ hours} = 16 \, \text{ hours/week} \]

Joey has 6 weeks until his exam, so the total study time is:
\[ 16 \, \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \, \text{ weeks} = 96 \, \text{ hours} \]

Joey studies 2 hours each night from Monday to Friday. This means he studies 2 * 5 = 10 hours per week from Monday to Friday. On the weekends, he studies 3 hours each day, which adds up to 3 * 2 = 6 hours per weekend day. There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). Therefore, over the weekend, he studies 6 * 2 = 12 hours. In total, Joey studies 10 + 12 = 22 hours. If the SAT exam is 6 weeks away, Joey will study for 22 hours per week. Therefore, Joey will spend 22 * 6 = 132 hours studying.
