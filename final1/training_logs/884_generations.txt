To find out how many pets Teddy, Ben, and Dave have combined, we need to calculate the number of pets each person has individually and then sum them up.

1. **Teddy's pets:**
   - Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats.
   - Total number of pets = 7 dogs + 8 cats = 15 pets.

2. **Ben's pets:**
   - Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy.
   - Since Teddy has 7 dogs, Ben has 7 + 9 = 16 dogs.
   - Ben has the same number of cats as Teddy, which is 8.
   - Total number of pets = 16 dogs + 8 cats = 24 pets.

3. **Dave's pets:**
   - Dave has 13 more cats and 5 less dogs than Teddy.
   - Since Teddy has 7 dogs, Dave has 7 - 5 = 2 fewer dogs.
   - Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy, which is 8 + 13 = 21 cats.
   - Total number of pets = 2 dogs + 21 cats = 23 pets.

4. **Total number of pets:**
   - Sum up the total number of pets each person has.
   - Total = Teddy's pets + Ben's pets + Dave's pets
   - Total = 15 + 24 + 23 = 62 pets.

To find out how many pets Teddy, Ben, and Dave have combined, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet each person has and then sum them up.

1. Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats:
   Dogs: 7
   Cats: 8

2. Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy:
   Dogs: 7 + 9 = 16

3. Dave has 13 more cats and 5 less dogs than Teddy:
   Cats: 8 + 13 = 21
   Dogs: 7 - 5 = 2
So, Dave has a total of 21 cats and 2 dogs.

Now, we can sum up all the pets each person has:
- Total pets from Teddy: 7 dogs + 8 cats = 15 pets
- Total pets from Ben: 16 dogs
- Total pets from Dave: 2 dogs + 21 cats = 23 pets

Adding them all together, we get:
Total pets = 15 (Teddy's) + 16 (Ben's) + 23 (Dave's) = 54 pets

Therefore, all three of them have a combined total of 54 pets.

First, let's determine the number of pets each person has:

- Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats, so Teddy's total pets = 7 + 8 = 15 pets.
- Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy, so Ben has 7 + 9 = 16 dogs. Since Ben has no cats mentioned, Ben's total pets = 16 dogs.
- Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy and 5 fewer dogs than Teddy. Hence, Dave has 8 + 13 = 21 cats and 7 - 5 = 2 dogs. Dave's total pets = 21 + 2 = 23 pets.

Now, let's calculate the combined number of pets:

- Teddy's pets: 15
- Ben's pets: 16
- Dave's pets: 23

We know that Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats. Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy, so Ben has \( 7 + 9 = 16 \) dogs. Dave has 13 more cats and 5 less dogs than Teddy, so Dave has \( 8 + 13 = 21 \) cats and \( 7 - 5 = 2 \) dogs. Now, we can add the number of pets that all three of them have:

- Teddy: \( 7 + 8 = 15 \) pets
- Ben: \( 16 + 0 = 16 \) pets (assuming he has no dogs)
- Dave: \( 21 + 2 = 23 \) pets

Now, to find the total number of pets, we sum them up:

\( 15 + 16 + 23 = 54 \) pets.

Therefore, the total number of pets that all of them have combined is 54.

To determine the total number of pets that Teddy, Ben, and Dave have combined, we first need to calculate the number of dogs and cats each person has.

1. **Teddy's pets:**
   - Dogs: 7
   - Cats: 8

2. **Ben's pets:**
   - Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy.
     - Ben's dogs: \( 7 + 9 = 16 \)
   - Ben's cats: The problem does not specify Ben's number of cats, so we assume he has the same number of cats as Teddy.
     - Ben's cats: 8

3. **Dave's pets:**
   - Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy, but 5 less dogs than Teddy.
     - Dave's cats: \( 8 + 13 = 21 \)
     - Dave's dogs: \( 7 - 5 = 2 \)

Now, let's calculate the total number of pets each person has:
- Teddy's total: \( 7 \text{ dogs} + 8 \text{ cats} = 15 \)
- Ben's total: \( 16 \text{ dogs} + 8 \text{ cats} = 24 \)
- Dave's total: \( 2 \text{ dogs} + 21 \text{ cats} = 23 \)

To find the total number of pets for all three, we sum the totals for each person:
\[ 15 \text{ (Teddy)} + 24 \text{ (Ben)} + 23 \text{ (Dave)} = 62 \]

Thus, the total number of pets they have combined is:

Teddy has 7 dogs, so the total number of dogs they all have combined is 7 (Teddy's) + 9 (Ben's) + (7 + 9) = 33.

Teddy has 8 cats, so the total number of cats they all have combined is 8 (Teddy's) + 13 (Dave's) + (8 + 13) = 39.

- Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy and 5 less dogs than Teddy, so Dave has \(8 + 13 = 21\) cats and \(7 - 5 = 2\) dogs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pets:

To find out how many pets all of them have combined, we need to calculate the total number of pets for each person first.

Teddy has 7 dogs + 8 cats = 15 pets.

Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy, so Ben has 7 + 9 = 16 dogs. Ben has 8 cats, so Ben has 16 + 8 = 24 pets.

Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy, so Dave has 8 + 13 = 21 cats. Dave also has 5 less dogs than Teddy, so Dave has 7 - 5 = 2 dogs. Dave has 2 + 21 = 23 pets.

Now, we add up the total number of pets:
Teddy: 15 pets
Ben: 24 pets
Dave: 23 pets

Total number of pets = 15 + 24 + 23 = 62 pets.

So, the answer is 62 pets combined.

To determine the total number of pets all three individuals have combined, we start by calculating the number of each type of pet each person has.

Teddy:
- Dogs: 7
- Cats: 8

Ben:
- Dogs: Since Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy, we add 9 to Teddy's number of dogs.
  Ben's dogs = 7 + 9 = 16
- Cats: No additional information is given, so the number remains the same.

Dave:
- Dogs: Since Dave has 5 less dogs than Teddy (Teddy has 7 dogs), we subtract 5 from Teddy's number of dogs.
  Dave's dogs = 7 - 5 = 2
- Cats: Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy, so we add 13 to Teddy's number of cats.
  Dave's cats = 8 + 13 = 21

Next, we calculate the total number of pets for each person:

Teddy's total pets = 7 dogs + 8 cats = 15
Ben's total pets = 16 dogs + 8 cats = 24
Dave's total pets = 2 dogs + 21 cats = 23

Finally, we add the totals for all three combined:

Combined total pets = Teddy's total + Ben's total + Dave's total
                     = 15 + 24 + 23
                     = 62

Therefore, the combined total number of pets is 62.

Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats. Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy, which means Ben has 7 + 9 = 16 dogs. Dave has 13 more cats and 5 less dogs than Teddy, meaning Dave has 8 + 13 = 21 cats and 7 - 5 = 2 dogs.

Therefore, Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats, Ben has 16 dogs and 0 cats, and Dave has 2 dogs and 21 cats.

The total number of pets is calculated as:
Teddy: 7 dogs + 8 cats = 15 pets
Ben: 16 dogs + 0 cats = 16 pets
Dave: 2 dogs + 21 cats = 23 pets

Combined total:
15 pets (Teddy) + 16 pets (Ben) + 23 pets (Dave) = 54 pets

To find out how many pets Teddy, Ben, and Dave have combined, we first need to calculate the number of pets each person has individually.

Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats. So, Teddy's total number of pets is:
\[ 7 \text{ dogs} + 8 \text{ cats} = 15 \text{ pets} \]

Next, we calculate how many pets Ben has. Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy, so:
\[ 7 \text{ dogs (Teddy)} + 9 \text{ dogs (Ben)} = 16 \text{ dogs (Ben)} \]

Since Ben has the same number of cats as Teddy:
\[ 8 \text{ cats (Teddy)} = 8 \text{ cats (Ben)} \]

So, Ben's total number of pets is:
\[ 16 \text{ dogs} + 8 \text{ cats} = 24 \text{ pets} \]

Now, let's calculate how many pets Dave has. Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy and 5 fewer dogs than Teddy:
\[ 8 \text{ cats (Teddy)} + 13 \text{ cats (Dave)} = 21 \text{ cats (Dave)} \]
\[ 7 \text{ dogs (Teddy)} - 5 \text{ dogs (Dave)} = 2 \text{ dogs (Dave)} \]

So, Dave's total number of pets is:
\[ 21 \text{ cats} + 2 \text{ dogs} = 23 \text{ pets} \]

To find the total number of pets all three have combined, we sum the pets each has:
\[ 15 \text{ (Teddy)} + 24 \text{ (Ben)} + 23 \text{ (Dave)} = 62 \text{ pets} \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in all three combined is:
