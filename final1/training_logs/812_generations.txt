To determine the total number of plates Matt needs to buy, let's break down the situation day by day.

In 3 days, Matt and his son eat alone, using 1 plate each. So, that amounts to 3 days * 1 plate per person = 3 plates.
In the other 4 days, Matt, his son, and his parents eat, using 2 plates each day. So, that amounts to 4 days * 2 plates per person = 8 plates.

Adding these together, the total number of plates Matt needs to buy is 3 (from the first 3 days) + 8 (from the remaining 4 days) = 11 plates.

Therefore, Matt needs to buy 11 plates.

To determine how many plates Matt needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of plates used per week. 

On the three days where only Matt and his son eat, the total number of plates used is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ plate per day} = 3 \text{ plates} \]

On the remaining four days when Matt, his son, and his parents eat, the total number of plates used is:
\[ 4 \text{ days} \times (1 \text{ plate per person} \times 3 \text{ people}) = 4 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ plates per day} = 12 \text{ plates} \]

Adding these two amounts together, the total number of plates used per week is:
\[ 3 \text{ plates} + 12 \text{ plates} = 15 \text{ plates} \]

Therefore, Matt needs to buy 15 plates to ensure he only has to do the dishes once a week.

First, we need to determine the number of people eating and the number of plates they use each day. On the three days it's Matt and his son only, there are 2 people and they use 1 plate each, so they use 2 plates per day (2 people * 1 plate per person = 2 plates). On the remaining four days, adding his parents, there are now 5 people and they use 2 plates each, so they use 10 plates per day (5 people * 2 plates per person = 10 plates).

To find the total number of plates needed per week, we add the plates used on the three days to the plates used on the four days:
2 plates/day * 3 days + 10 plates/day * 4 days = 6 plates + 40 plates = 46 plates.

Therefore, Matt needs to buy 46 plates.

To determine the number of plates Matt needs to buy, we will calculate the total number of plates used per week.

First, we calculate the plates used when Matt and his son are eating:
- They each use 1 plate.
- There are 3 such days per week.

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ plates per day} = 6 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we need to consider the days when Matt, his son, and his parents are eating. These are:
- There are \(7 - 3 = 4\) such days per week.

On these days, everyone uses 2 plates.

\[ 4 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ plates per day} = 8 \text{ plates} \]

Now, we add the plates used on those days to the plates used on the first days to find the total number of plates used in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ plates} + 8 \text{ plates} = 14 \text{ plates} \]

Therefore, Matt needs to buy 14 plates.

Matt uses 1 plate each day when it's just him and his son, which totals to \(3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ plate/day} = 3 \text{ plates}\) for those days. On the remaining 4 days (since there are 7 days in a week and 3 are already accounted for), his parents join them, and everyone uses 2 plates, which amounts to \(4 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ plates/day} = 8 \text{ plates}\).

In total, Matt needs \(3 \text{ plates} + 8 \text{ plates} = 11 \text{ plates}\) to cover the entire week.

To determine how many plates Matt needs to buy, we need to consider the number of plates used in different scenarios.

1. **Three days per week:**
   - Matt and his son use 1 plate each per day.
   - Therefore, for 3 days, the total number of plates used is:
   \[
   3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ plate/day} = 3 \text{ plates}
   \]

2. **Remaining days per week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, and 3 of those days involve only Matt and his son, each using 1 plate.
   - The remaining days involve Matt, his son, and his parents using 2 plates each day.
   - So for the remaining 4 days, the total number of plates used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ plates/day} = 8 \text{ plates}
   \]

3. **Total plates used weekly:**
   - Adding the number of plates from both scenarios, we get:
   \[
   3 \text{ (plates from 3 days)} + 8 \text{ (plates from remaining days)} = 11 \text{ plates}
   \]

Therefore, Matt needs to buy 11 plates.

To calculate the total number of plates Matt needs to buy, let's break down the problem day by day:

1. **3 days a week**: Matt and his son use 1 plate each. This amounts to \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) plates per day.
   - For 3 such days, the total is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) plates.

2. **4 days a week**: Matt, his son, and his parents use 2 plates each. This amounts to \( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \) plates per day.
   - For 4 such days, the total is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) plates.

Adding both scenarios together:
   - Total plates for the 3 days: 6
   - Total plates for the 4 days: 32
   - Total plates needed = \( 6 + 32 = 38 \) plates.

Therefore, Matt needs to buy a total of 38 plates.

To determine the total number of plates Matt needs to buy, let's break down the consumption over a week:

1. On the three days, only Matt and his son eat:
   - Each of them uses 1 plate per meal.
   - Therefore, each of those days requires \(1 \text{ plate/person} \times 2 \text{ people} = 2 \text{ plates}\).
   - Over three such days, the total number of plates used is \(2 \text{ plates/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ plates}\).

2. On the remaining four days, Matt, his son, and his parents eat:
   - Each person uses 2 plates.
   - Therefore, each of those days requires \(2 \text{ plates/person} \times 4 \text{ people} = 8 \text{ plates}\).
   - Over four such days, the total number of plates used is \(8 \text{ plates/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ plates}\).

Adding these together gives the total number of plates needed for the week:
\[6 \text{ plates} + 32 \text{ plates} = 38 \text{ plates}\]

Thus, Matt needs to buy a total of 38 plates.

To determine the total number of plates Matt needs to buy, we need to calculate the plates used on both occasions: the days when only Matt and his son use the plates and the days when everyone (Matt, his son, and their parents) uses the plates.

1. **Days when only Matt and his son use plates:**
   - Number of days: 3 days
   - Plates used per day: 1 plate per person (Matt + son)
   - Total plates for these days: \(3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ plate/day} = 3 \text{ plates}\)

2. **Days when everyone (Matt, his son, and their parents) use plates:**
   - Number of days: 2 days (since there are 7 days in a week and 3 days are only for Matt and his son)
   - Plates used per day: 2 plates per person (Matt + son + parents)
   - Total plates for these days: \(2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ plates/day} = 4 \text{ plates}\)

3. **Total plates needed:**
   - Plates for Matt and his son days: 3 plates
   - Plates for everyone days: 4 plates
   - Total plates: \(3 + 4 = 7 \text{ plates}\)

Therefore, Matt needs to buy 7 plates.

First, let's calculate the total number of plates used on a given day when Matt and his son eat alone. Since they use 1 plate each, they use a total of 2 plates per day.

On 3 days of the week, Matt and his son eat alone, so the total number of plates used on those 3 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ plates/day} = 6 \text{ plates} \]

On the remaining 4 days of the week, Matt, his son, and his parents eat together, so they use 2 plates each day. Therefore, the total number of plates used on those 4 days is:
\[ 4 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ plates/day} = 16 \text{ plates} \]

To find the total number of plates used in a week, we add the plates used on the two sets of days:
\[ 6 \text{ plates} + 16 \text{ plates} = 22 \text{ plates} \]

Since Matt wants to do dishes only once a week, he needs to buy 22 plates.

Matt and his son eat for three days a week, using 1 plate each, so they use a total of 3 plates per day for his son's meals. Therefore, in three days, they use 3 plates/day * 3 days = 9 plates for his son's meals.

On the remaining four days, Matt and his parents eat, using 2 plates each day. This means a total of 4 days * 2 plates/day = 8 plates are used for dining by Matt and his parents.

Adding both quantities of plates together, Matt and his son use 9 plates for 3 days, and 8 plates for 4 days, for a total of 9 + 8 = 17 plates needed over a week.

Next, let's calculate the number of plates used on the days where Matt and his son's parents join them. This happens 2 days a week (since there are 7 days in a week and 3 days where only Matt and his son eat), and each person uses 2 plates, so:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ plates/person} = 8 \text{ plates} \]

Adding these two amounts gives the total number of plates needed per week:

   - Total plates used per weekday: \(3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ plate/day} = 3 \text{ plates}\).

2. **Weekend days (2 days):**
   - Matt's parents join him, and they use 2 plates each day.
   - Total plates used per weekend day: \(2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ plates/day} = 4 \text{ plates}\).

Now, let’s calculate the total number of plates used in a week:

\[ 1 \text{ plate/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 3 \text{ plates/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of plates used when Matt, his son, and his parents are eating. Since everyone uses 2 plates that day, and there are 4 people, the total number of plates used per week when everyone is eating is:
