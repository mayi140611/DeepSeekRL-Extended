###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A shady restaurant is charging customers gratuities after taxes without them being aware. If my total bill was $140, the sales tax in my city is 10%, I ordered a NY Striploin for $80, and I ordered a glass of wine for $10, how much did they charge me for gratuities?

Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The total bill is $140.
2. The tax is 10%, which means the tax amount is 0.10 * $140 = $14.
3. The cost of the NY Striploin is $80.
4. The cost of the wine is $10.
5. The total cost (without tax or gratuities) would be $80 + $10 = $90.
6. The cost including tax is $90 + $14 = $104.
7. To find the amount charged for gratuities, subtract the total cost (including tax but before gratuities) from the total bill. So, $140 - $104 = $36.

Therefore, they charged you $36 for gratuities.

The total bill before tax and gratuities is $140. The sales tax is 10%. The price of the NY Striploin is $80, and the price of the wine is $10. The total tax amount is 10% of $140, which is $14. The total bill including tax is $140 + $14 = $154. The total cost without the gratuities is $80 + $10 + $14 = $104. The total cost with the gratuities is $154. The total gratuities charged are $154 - $104 = $50.

The total bill before gratuities and sales tax was $80 + $10 = $90. The sales tax was 10% so 10% of $90 is $90 $\times$ 0.1 = $9. The total bill after adding the sales tax is $90 + $9 = $99. The rest of the money is the gratuities so $140 - $99 = $41.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total tax on the restaurant's charges before gratuities. The sales tax is 10%, so the tax amount on $140 is \(140 \times 0.10 = \$14\).

2. Next, let's add the tax amount to the original total bill to get the pre-gratuity bill: \(140 + 14 = \$154\).

3. Now we know the pre-gratuity bill is $154, and the total bill with gratuities is $140. So, the total gratuity amount is \(154 - 140 = \$14\).

4. Since gratuities were charged after taxes, the amount charged for gratuities is the total gratuity amount, which we have calculated to be $14.

To find out how much the restaurant charged you for gratuities, we first need to calculate the total cost of the meal including sales tax and taxes.

1. The cost of the NY Striploin is $80, and there is no mention of a tip on this item, so we assume it doesn't include a tip.
2. The cost of the glass of wine is $10.
3. The sales tax in your city is 10% of the total cost before tax.

Let's calculate the total cost of the meal including tax and tip:

- Total cost before tax = Cost of steak + Cost of wine = $80 + $10 = $90
- Total cost before tax and additional charges = $90

Now, calculate the sales tax:
- Sales tax = 10% of total cost before tax and additional charges = 0.10 * $90 = $9

Finally, add the sales tax to the total cost to find the total cost including tax:
- Total cost including tax = $90 + $9 = $99

The total bill without gratuities is $140. Therefore, the amount charged for gratuities is the difference between the total bill and the total cost of the meal including tax and sales tax:
- Amount for gratuities = Total bill - Total cost including tax = $140 - $99 = $41

Thus, the restaurant charged you $41 for gratuities.

              = $14
2. Now, subtract the cost of the NY Striploin and the glass of wine from the total bill.
   Subtract the cost of items = $140 - ($80 + $10)
                            = $140 - $90

Let's calculate the gratuities step by step:

1. First, calculate the total cost of the meal (before tax and tip):
   Meal cost = Price of NY Striploin + Price of wine
   Meal cost = $80 + $10 = $90

2. Next, calculate the tax on the meal:
   Tax = Meal cost * Sales tax rate
   Tax = $90 * 10% = $9

3. Now, subtract the tax from the meal cost to get the pre-tip cost:
   Pre-tip cost = Meal cost - Tax
   Pre-tip cost = $90 - $9 = $81

4. The total amount charged (including tax and tip) was $140. Letâ€™s denote the tip as T. So:
   Total bill = Pre-tip cost + T
   $140 = $81 + T

5. Now, solve for T:
   T = $140 - $81
   T = $59

So, the gratuities charged to the customer were $59.

The total bill before gratuities is $80 (cost of the steak) + $10 (cost of the wine) = $90.

The sales tax is 10%, so the tax amount is $90 * 10% = $9.

The total bill before tax and gratuities is $90 + $9 = $99.

The total bill including gratuities is $140.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total bill including gratuities after taxes is $140.
2. The sales tax in the city is 10%, which means the total bill before tax is \( \frac{140}{1 + 0.10} = \frac{140}{1.10} \approx 127.27 \).
3. The cost of the NY Striploin is $80 and the cost of the wine is $10.
4. Therefore, the total cost before tax and gratuities is \( 80 + 10 = 90 \).
5. The remaining amount that we have to account for is the gratuities, which is the difference between the total bill before tax and cost and the total bill after tax, i.e., the total bill after tax is \( 127.27 \).
6. So, the gratuities are \( 140 - 127.27 = 12.73 \).

Thus, the amount charged as gratuities is **$12.73**.

To find out how much the restaurant charged you for gratuities, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost before tax.
2. Calculate the total cost including tax.
3. Subtract the cost of your order from the total cost including tax to find the amount you were charged for gratuities.

Let's start with step 1:
Total cost before tax = Cost of NY Striploin + Cost of wine
Total cost before tax = $80 + $10 = $90

Step 2:
Total cost after tax = Total cost before tax + (Total cost before tax * Tax rate)
Total cost after tax = $90 + ($90 * 10%)
Total cost after tax = $90 + $9 = $99

Step 3:
Gratuities = Total cost after tax - Cost of your order

Gratuities = $99 - $80 = $19

So, the restaurant charged you $19 for gratuities.

Let's calculate the total cost before gratuities first:
- NY Striploin: $80
- Wine: $10

Total before tax and gratuities = $80 + $10 = $90

Now, let's consider the sales tax:
- Sales tax rate: 10%

Sales tax amount = 10% of $90
= 0.10 * $90
= $9

Now, we add the sales tax to the original total before tax:
- Total (before gratuities) = $90

Total (before gratuities and tax) = $90
Sales Tax = $9

The total before gratuities and tax is $90. Since the total bill is $140, the gratuities must be the difference between the total bill and the total (before gratuities and tax):
- Total (before gratuities and tax) = $90
- Total bill = $140

Let's find the gratuities:
- Gratuities = Total bill - Total (before gratuities and tax)
= $140 - $90
= $50

However, this calculation doesn't consider that the tax was already included in the original total of $90 before the gratuities calculation. This means that the $50 calculated above is the actual gratuities charged to the customer.

The total bill including sales tax can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the sales tax on the NY Striploin.
2. Add the cost of the NY Striploin and the sales tax to get the subtotal.
3. Calculate the total tax, which is 10% of the subtotal.
4. Add the total tax to the subtotal to get the total bill.

Given:
- Cost of NY Striploin = $80
- Cost of wine = $10
- Total bill = $140
- Sales tax rate = 10% = 0.10

First, the sales tax on the NY Striploin is:
\[ \text{Sales tax on NY Striploin} = 80 \times 0.10 = \$8 \]

Next, the subtotal is:
\[ \text{Subtotal} = \text{Cost of NY Striploin} + \text{Cost of wine} + \text{Sales tax on NY Striploin} = 80 + 10 + 8 = \$98 \]

The total tax is:
\[ \text{Total tax} = 98 \times 0.10 = \$9.80 \]

Finally, the total bill is:
\[ \text{Total bill} = \text{Subtotal} + \text{Total tax} = 98 + 9.80 = \$107.80 \]

Therefore, the amount charged for gratuities is:
\[ \text{Gratuities} = \text{Total bill} - \text{Total tax} = 107.80 - 9.80 = \$98 \]

To calculate the gratuities, we need to consider both the sales tax and the tip. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the tax on the items ordered:**
    - The cost of the NY Striploin is $80.
    - The cost of the wine is $10.
    - The total cost of the items is $80 + $10 = $90.
    - The sales tax is 10% of the total cost.

    \[
    \text{Tax} = 0.10 \times 90 = 9
    \]

2. **Calculate the total bill before gratuities:**
    - The total bill (including tax) is $140.
    - The tax is $9.

    \[
    \text{Total bill before gratuities} = 140 - 9 = 131
    \]

3. **Determine the gratuities:**
    - The total bill before gratuities is $131.
    - We need to find out how much gratuities were charged on top of this without the customer being aware of it.

    \[
    \text{Gratuities} = \text{Total bill without tax} - \text{Total bill with tax}
    \]

    Here, we need to consider the tip percentage, but since the problem doesn't specify the tip percentage, we'll assume the customer is charged for both tax and tip. So, the gratuities will be deducted from their total bill.

    \[
    \text{Gratuities} = 140 - 131 = 9
    \]

4. **Conclusion:**
    - The restaurant charged $9 for gratuities along with the $9 tax from the total bill before tip.

Therefore, the restaurant charged you $9 for gratuities.
