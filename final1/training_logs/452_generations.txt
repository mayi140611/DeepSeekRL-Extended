system
First, we need to find the total number of shells collected by Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton. This can be done by adding the numbers together:

\[ 29 + 17 + 8 = 54 \]

Next, since they plan to distribute the 54 shells evenly between two friends, we need to divide the total number of shells by 2:

\[ 54 \div 2 = 27 \]

Therefore, each friend will get 27 shells.

To find out how many shells each friend gets, we first need to calculate the total number of shells collected by Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton. 

Total shells = (Jillian's shells) + (Savannah's shells) + (Clayton's shells)
Total shells = 29 + 17 + 8

Now, let's add these numbers:

Total shells = 29 + 17 + 8
Total shells = 46 + 8
Total shells = 54

Next, we distribute the total shells evenly to the two friends.

Shells per friend = Total shells / Number of friends
Shells per friend = 54 / 2

Now, let's calculate how many shells each friend gets:

Shells per friend = 27

So each friend gets 27 shells.

To find out how many shells each friend gets, we first need to calculate the total number of shells collected by Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton.

Total number of shells = Jillian's shells + Savannah's shells + Clayton's shells
Total number of shells = 29 + 17 + 8

Let's add these numbers:

29 + 17 + 8 = 54

Now that we know there are a total of 54 shells, we need to divide them equally between two friends.

Shells per friend = Total number of shells ÷ Number of friends
Shells per friend = 54 ÷ 2

Let's calculate that:

54 ÷ 2 = 27

So, each friend gets 27 shells.

To find out how many shells each friend gets, we first need to calculate the total number of shells collected by Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton. This can be done by adding the individual amounts:

Jillian's shells: 29
Savannah's shells: 17
Clayton's shells: 8

Total shells = 29 + 17 + 8

Shells per friend = Total shells / 2

Calculating the total number of shells:

29 + 17 + 8 = 54 shells

Dividing the total shells evenly between the two friends:

54 / 2 = 27 shells

Therefore, each friend gets 27 shells.
