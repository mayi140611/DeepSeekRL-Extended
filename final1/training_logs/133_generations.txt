There are 40 students in a class, so 1/10 of them are absent, which is 40*1/10 = 4 students. This means that there are 40 - 4 = 36 students present in the classroom.
3/4 of the students who are present are in the classroom, so there are 36*3/4 = 27 students in the classroom.
This means that there are 36 - 27 = 9 students in the canteen.

The total number of students is 40. 

- The number of absent students is 40 * (1/10) = 4 students.
- The number of students who are present is 40 - 4 = 36 students.
- The number of students in the classroom is 36 * (3/4) = 27 students.
- Therefore, the number of students in the canteen is 36 - 27 = 9 students.

To determine how many students are in the canteen, we first need to find out how many students are present in the classroom. We know that 1/10 of the students are absent, so 9/10 of the students are present.

\[ \text{Number of students present} = \frac{9}{10} \times 40 \]

\[ \text{Number of students present} = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 36 students are in the classroom. We are told that 3/4 of the students who are present are in the classroom.

\[ \text{Number of students in the classroom} = \frac{3}{4} \times 36 \]

\[ \text{Number of students in the classroom} = 27 \]

Now that we know 27 students are in the classroom and 36 are present in total, the rest must be in the canteen.

\[ \text{Number of students in the canteen} = \text{Total number of students present} - \text{Number of students in the classroom} \]

\[ \text{Number of students in the canteen} = 36 - 27 \]

\[ \text{Number of students in the canteen} = 9 \]

Therefore, 9 students are in the canteen.

There are a total of 40 * 10 = 400 students in the class.
400 * 3/4 = 300 students are in the classroom.
40 - 400/10 = 36 students are in the hall.
40 - 300 - 36 = 6 students are in the canteen.

To find out how many students are in the canteen, we first need to determine how many students are present in the class.

1/10 of the 40 students are absent, so the number of absent students is:
40 students * 1/10 = 4 students

This means 40 - 4 = 36 students are present.

3/4 of these 36 present students are in the classroom, so the number of students in the classroom is:
36 students * 3/4 = 27 students

Therefore, the rest of the students, 36 - 27 = 9 students, are in the canteen.

First, calculate the number of students absent. Since 1/10 are absent, 

\[ \frac{1}{10} \times 40 = 4 \text{ students are absent} \]

This means the number of students present is 

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ students} \]

Out of the students who are present, 3/4 are in the classroom. Therefore,

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 36 = 27 \text{ students are in the classroom} \]

Since there are 36 students present and 27 are in the classroom, the rest of the students are in the canteen:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ students are in the canteen} \]

If 1/10 of the students are absent, that means 8/10 are present. 

3/4 of the present students are in the classroom, so 1/4 of the present students are in the canteen.

8/10 of the students are present, which equals 0.8 students in 10 students. So 0.8 * 10 = 8 students are in the canteen.

system
First, let's calculate the number of students who are present: 

Total number of students = 40

Number of students absent = 1/10 * 40 = 4

Number of students present = Total number of students - Number of students absent
= 40 - 4 = 36

Now, let's calculate the number of students in the classroom:

Number of students in the classroom = 3/4 * Number of students present
= 3/4 * 36 = 27

Now, let's calculate the number of students in the canteen:

Number of students in the canteen = Number of students present - Number of students in the classroom
= 36 - 27 = 9

So, there are 9 students in the canteen.

In the class, there are 40 students, and 1/10 are absent, so 40 * 1/10 = 4 students are absent.
This means that 40 - 4 = 36 students are present.
Out of the 36 students present, 3/4 are in the classroom, so 36 * 3/4 = 27 students are in the classroom.
Therefore, the remaining students are 36 - 27 = 9 students who are in the canteen.

To find out how many students are in the canteen, we first need to determine the number of students who are present. Since 1/10 are absent, 9/10 must be present, which is 9/10 * 40 students = 36 students. Then, we determine the number of students who are in the classroom, which is 3/4 of the present students, equaling 3/4 * 36 = 27 students.
