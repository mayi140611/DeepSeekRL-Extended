Mr. Grey is purchasing gifts for his family. So far he has purchased 3 polo shirts for $26 each; 2 necklaces for $83 each; and 1 computer game for $90. Since Mr. Grey purchased all those using his credit card, he received a $12 rebate. What is the total cost of the gifts after the rebate?

system
To find the total cost of the gifts after the rebate, first calculate the total cost of the gifts without the rebate:

3 polo shirts * $26 each = $78
2 necklaces * $83 each = $166
1 computer game * $90 = $90

Total cost without rebate = $78 + $166 + $90 = $334

Now, subtract the rebate:

Total cost after rebate = $334 - $12 = $322

The cost of the polo shirts is 3 * $26 = $78. The cost of the necklaces is 2 * $83 = $166. The cost of the computer game is $90. So the total is $78 + $166 + $90 = $334. After the rebate, the total cost is $334 - $12 = $322.

The cost of the polo shirts is \(3 \times 26 = 78\) dollars. The cost of the necklaces is \(2 \times 83 = 166\) dollars. Adding the cost of the computer game, the total cost of the gifts is \(78 + 166 + 90 = 334\) dollars. After applying the $12 rebate, the total cost of the gifts is \(334 - 12 = 322\) dollars.

The cost of the polo shirts is 3*$26 = $78
The cost of the necklaces is 2*$83 = $166
The cost of the computer game is $90
So the total cost of the gifts is $78+$166+$90 = $334
And after receiving $12 rebate, Mr. Grey will need to pay $334-$12 = $322

The cost of 3 polo shirts is 3*26 = $78. The cost of 2 necklaces is 2*83 = $166. The cost of one computer game is 90. So before the rebate the total cost was 78+166+90 = $334. Since Mr. Grey was given $12 as a rebate, the cost after the rebate is 334-12 = $322.

Each polo shirt costs $26, and Mr. Grey purchased 3, so the total cost for the polo shirts is 3 * $26 = $78.
Each necklace costs $83, and Mr. Grey purchased 2, so the total cost for the necklaces is 2 * $83 = $166.
The computer game cost $90.
The total cost of all the gifts before the rebate is $78 + $166 + $90 = $334.
Mr. Grey received a $12 rebate, so we need to subtract the rebate from the total cost, which is $334 - $12 = $322.
Therefore, the total cost of the gifts after the rebate is $322.

Mr. Grey spent 3 × $26 = $78 for the polo shirts. He spent 2 × $83 = $166 for the necklaces. Therefore, he has spent $78 + $166 + $90 = $334. After adding the $12 rebate, the total cost of the gifts is $334 - $12 = $322.

Each polo shirt is $26, so 3 polo shirts cost $26*3 = $78
Each necklace is $83, so 2 necklaces cost $83*2 = $166
When combined with the computer game, Mr. Grey spent $90 + $166 = $256
Since Mr. Grey was given a $12 discount upon purchasing, his total spending came to $256 - $12 = $244
Since the total cost of the gifts after the rebate is the cost of the gifts minus the rebate, it comes to $244 - $12 = $232
