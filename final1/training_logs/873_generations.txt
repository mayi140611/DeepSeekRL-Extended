###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Kimberly went strawberry picking with her family over the weekend. She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked and her parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. If her brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, how many strawberries would they each have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them?

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how many strawberries Kimberly's brother picked. Since he picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, he picked a total of \(3 \times 15 = 45\) strawberries.

Kimberly picked 8 times the amount her brother picked, so she picked \(8 \times 45 = 360\) strawberries.

Her parents picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly, so they picked \(360 - 93 = 267\) strawberries.

Now, we add up the total number of strawberries each person picked:
- Kimberly: 360 strawberries
- Her brother: 45 strawberries
- Her parents: 267 strawberries

The total number of strawberries they picked is \(360 + 45 + 267 = 672\) strawberries.

They need to divide this total equally among the 3 of them, so each person would get \(672 \div 3 = 224\) strawberries.

Therefore, each of them would have 224 strawberries if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them.

1. First, let's determine how many strawberries Kimberly's brother picked. Each of his 3 baskets contains 15 strawberries, so the total number of strawberries Kimberly's brother picked is:
   \[
   3 \text{ baskets} \times 15 \text{ strawberries/basket} = 45 \text{ strawberries}
   \]

2. Kimberly picked 8 times the amount her brother picked. Therefore:
   \[
   8 \times 45 \text{ strawberries} = 360 \text{ strawberries}
   \]

3. Kimberly's parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. So:
   \[
   360 \text{ strawberries} - 93 \text{ strawberries} = 267 \text{ strawberries}
   \]

4. Now, let's find the total number of strawberries picked by all four of them:
   \[
   45 \text{ strawberries} + 360 \text{ strawberries} + 267 \text{ strawberries} = 672 \text{ strawberries}
   \]

5. To determine how many strawberries each person would have if they divide the strawberries equally, we need to divide the total number of strawberries by the total number of people (4 people):
   \[
   \frac{672 \text{ strawberries}}{4} = 168 \text{ strawberries per person}
   \]

Therefore, each person would have 168 strawberries.

Kimberly picked 8 times the amount her brother picked, so she picked \(8 \times 45 = 360\) strawberries.

Her parents picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly, so they picked \(360 - 93 = 267\) strawberries.

Kimberly's brother picked 3 baskets, each with 15 strawberries, so his total is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) strawberries.

1. First, calculate the total number of strawberries Kimberly's brother picked:
   \[
   3 \text{ baskets} \times 15 \text{ strawberries per basket} = 45 \text{ strawberries}
   \]

2. Kimberly picked 8 times the amount her brother picked:
   \[
   8 \times 45 \text{ strawberries} = 360 \text{ strawberries}
   \]

3. Her parents picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly:
   \[
   360 \text{ strawberries} - 93 \text{ strawberries} = 267 \text{ strawberries}
   \]

4. Now, calculate the total number of strawberries picked collectively:
   \[
   45 \text{ strawberries} + 360 \text{ strawberries} + 267 \text{ strawberries} = 672 \text{ strawberries}
   \]

5. Divide the total number of strawberries equally among the four family members:
   \[
   \frac{672 \text{ strawberries}}{4 \text{ people}} = 168 \text{ strawberries per person}
   \]

6. Since each person should have the same amount, we conclude each of them would have 168 strawberries.

First, let's determine the number of strawberries Kimberly's brother picked. Given that his brother picked 3 baskets, each containing 15 strawberries, the total number of strawberries his brother picked is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) strawberries.

Kimberly picked 8 times the amount that her brother picked, so she picked \(8 \times 45 = 360\) strawberries.

Her parents picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly, so they picked \(360 - 93 = 267\) strawberries.

Now, let's calculate the total number of strawberries they all picked together. The brother picked 45 strawberries, Kimberly picked 360 strawberries, and her parents picked 267 strawberries, so the total number of strawberries is \(45 + 360 + 267 = 672\) strawberries.

Finally, to determine how many strawberries each would have if they divided the total number equally, we divide the total number of strawberries by the number of people, which is 3 (Kimberly, her brother, and her parents). So, each person would have \(672 \div 3 = 224\) strawberries.

Next, we calculate the number of strawberries Kimberly picked. Since she picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked, Kimberly picked \(8 \times 45 = 360\) strawberries.

Then, we find out how many strawberries Kimberly's parents picked. Since they picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly, they picked \(360 - 93 = 267\) strawberries.

To find the total number of strawberries they all picked together, we add up the amounts: \(45 + 360 + 267 = 672\).

Now, to find out how many strawberries each person would have if they divided the total number equally, we divide the total by 4 (the number of people), so \(672 \div 4 = 168\).

Therefore, each person would have 168 strawberries.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:
1. Kimberly picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked.
2. Kimberly's brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, so his total is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) strawberries.
3. Kimberly picked \(8 \times 45 = 360\) strawberries.
4. Kimberly's parents picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly, so they picked \(360 - 93 = 267\) strawberries.

The total number of strawberries picked by all of them is \(360 + 45 + 267\) strawberries. If they divide this total equally amongst them, we can calculate the amount each gets.

Now, let's use the calculation:
\[317 \text{ (total strawberries)} \div 5 \text{ (number of people)} = 63.4 \text{ (strawberries per person)}\]
Each person gets 63 strawberries, and since they cannot split strawberries into fractions, they would need to round to the nearest whole number, which is 63 strawberries per person.
