#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find the total amount of money shared, we need to calculate how much Tony received and then add it to what Ken received.

1. Ken received $1750.
2. Tony received twice as much as Ken, which is \(2 \times 1750\) dollars.

Therefore, Tony received \(2 \times 1750 = 3500\) dollars.
3. To find the total amount shared, we add Ken's share and Tony's share together.

Total amount shared = Ken's share + Tony's share
Total amount shared = $1750 + $3500
Total amount shared = $5250.

So, the total amount of money shared was $5250.

Given that Ken got $1750, and Tony got twice as much as Ken, we can calculate Tony's share as follows:

1. Tony's contribution = 2 * Ken's contribution
2. Tony's contribution = 2 * $1750
3. Tony's contribution = $3500

To find the total (money shared), we use:

4. Total money shared = Ken's contribution + Tony's contribution
5. Total money shared = $1750 + $3500
6. Total money shared = $5250

Therefore, the total amount of money shared between Ken and Tony is $5250.

To find out the total amount of money shared, we first need to calculate how much money Tony received. Given that Tony got twice as much as Ken, we can calculate Tony's share by multiplying Ken's share by 2. Ken's share is $1750. So,

\[ \text{Tony's share} = 2 \times \text{Ken's share} = 2 \times 1750 = $3500 \]

Next, we add Ken's share to Tony's share to find the total amount of money shared:

\[ \text{Total amount of money shared} = \text{Ken's share} + \text{Tony's share} = 1750 + 3500 = $5250 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money shared between Mr. Sam's two sons is $5250.

To find out the total amount of money shared, we need to add the amounts received by Ken and Tony.

Ken got $1750.
Tony got twice as much as Ken, which means Tony got 2 * $1750 = $3500.

Now, add the amounts received by Ken and Tony to find the total amount:

$1750 (Ken) + $3500 (Tony) = $5250

So, the total amount of money shared was $5250.

To find the total amount of money shared, you first need to determine how much Tony received, which is twice Ken's amount.

Tony got $3500 (since Ken got $1750 and Tony got twice as much).

So, Ken got $1750 and Tony got $3500, making a total of $1750 + $3500 = $5250.

Therefore, the money shared amounted to $5250.

To determine how much money Mr. Sam shared between his two sons, Ken and Tony, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of money Ken received.
   Ken received $1750.

2. Determine how much money Tony received.
   Tony received twice as much as Ken. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Amount Tony received} = 2 \times 1750 = 3500
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of money shared by adding the amounts received by Ken and Tony.
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Amount Ken received} + \text{Amount Tony received} = 1750 + 3500 = 5250
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money shared is:
\[
\boxed{5250}
\]

Let's reason through this problem step by step:

First, we know from the information given that Ken got $1750. We are also told that Tony got twice as much as Ken. Therefore, we can calculate how much Tony received:
\[ \text{Amount Tony got} = 2 \times \text{Amount Ken got} = 2 \times 1750 = 3500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of money shared between Ken and Tony. To do this, we add the amounts each one received:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Amount Ken got} + \text{Amount Tony got} = 1750 + 3500 = 5250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money shared between Ken and Tony is $5250.

This reasoning and calculation leads us to the answer:
5250 dollars

To find out the total amount of money shared between Ken and Tony, we first need to understand that Tony got twice as much as Ken. Given that Ken got $1750, we can calculate Tony's share by multiplying Ken's share by 2:

Tony's share = Ken's share × 2
Tony's share = $1750 × 2
Tony's share = $3500

Now, to find the total amount of money shared, we add the shares of Ken and Tony together:

Total money = Ken's share + Tony's share
Total money = $1750 + $3500
Total money = $5250

So, the total amount of money shared between Ken and Tony is $5250.

Let's break down the information given:

- Ken got $1750.
- Tony got twice as much as Ken, which means Tony got \(2 \times 1750 = $3500\).

Now, to find out the total amount shared between Ken and Tony, we simply add their amounts together:

Total amount shared = Ken's amount + Tony's amount
Total amount shared = $1750 + $3500
Total amount shared = $5250

Therefore, the total amount shared between Ken and Tony is $5250.

To find out how much money was shared, we can use the information given to set up an equation.

Let's denote the total amount of money shared as \( T \).

According to the problem, Ken got $1750 and Tony got twice as much as Ken. So, Tony got \( 2 \times 1750 = $3500 \).

Since the total amount shared is the sum of what Ken and Tony got, we have:

\( T = 1750 + 3500 \)

\( T = 5250 \)

So, the total amount of money shared is $5250.
