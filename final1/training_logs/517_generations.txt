Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of marbles Merill has.
- \( E \) as the number of marbles Elliot has.
- \( S \) as the number of marbles Selma has.

From the information given:
1. Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, so \( M = 2E \).
2. Together, Merill and Elliot have five fewer marbles than Selma, which can be written as \( M + E = S - 5 \).
3. Selma has fifty marbles, so \( S = 50 \).

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, substitute \( S = 50 \) into the second equation:
\[ M + E = 50 - 5 \]
\[ M + E = 45 \]

From the first equation, we know:
\[ M = 2E \]

Substitute \( M = 2E \) into the equation \( M + E = 45 \):
\[ 2E + E = 45 \]
\[ 3E = 45 \]
\[ E = 15 \]

Now, substitute \( E = 15 \) back into \( M = 2E \) to find \( M \):
\[ M = 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

So, \( M = 30 \) marbles.

Let's denote the number of marbles Merill has as \( M \) and the number of marbles Elliot has as \( E \).

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, so we can write this as:
   \[
   M = 2E
   \]

2. Together, Merill and Elliot have five fewer marbles than Selma. If Selma has fifty marbles, then Merill and Elliot together have:
   \[
   50 - 5 = 45 \text{ marbles}
   \]
   So, we can write this relationship as:
   \[
   M + E = 45
   \]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( M = 2E \)
2. \( M + E = 45 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. From the first equation, we know \( M = 2E \), so we can substitute \( 2E \) for \( M \) in the second equation:
\[
2E + E = 45
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
3E = 45
\]
Now, we solve for \( E \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
E = 15
\]

Now that we know \( E = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[
M = 2E = 2 \times 15 = 30
\]

So, Merill has \(\boxed{30}\) marbles.

Let the number of marbles Merill has be \(M\). Since Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, the number of marbles Elliot has is \(M/2\).

Together, Merill and Elliot have \(M + M/2 = \frac{3M}{2}\).

Since Elliot has \(M/2\), the total number of marbles they have together is \(M + M/2 = \frac{3M}{2}\). This is 5 fewer than Selma's \(50\) marbles, so we can write that as \(50 - 5 = \frac{3M}{2}\).

Solving for \(M\), we have \(45 = \frac{3M}{2}\). Multiplying both sides by \(2\) gives \(90 = 3M\). Dividing both sides by \(3\) yields \(M = 30\).

So, Merill has \(30\) marbles.

system
Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of marbles Merill has,
- \( E \) as the number of marbles Elliot has,
- \( S \) as the number of marbles Selma has.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, which is written as:
\[ M = 2E \]

2. The total number of marbles Merill and Elliot have together is five fewer than Selma's marbles. This gives us:
\[ M + E = S - 5 \]

We also know that:
\[ S = 50 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 50 \) into the second equation:
\[ M + E = 50 - 5 \]
\[ M + E = 45 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( M = 2E \)
2. \( M + E = 45 \)

Substitute the value of \( M \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2E + E = 45 \]
\[ 3E = 45 \]

Now solve for \( E \):
\[ E = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ E = 15 \]

Now that we have \( E = 15 \), substitute it back into the first equation:
\[ M = 2E \]
\[ M = 2 \cdot 15 \]
\[ M = 30 \]

Therefore, Merill has 30 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Merill has, we start with the information given:

1. Selma has fifty marbles.
2. Together, Merill and Elliot have five fewer marbles than Selma.

Since Selma has fifty marbles, Merill and Elliot together have \(50 - 5 = 45\) marbles.

Given that Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, we can set up the following equation:

\[M + E = 45\]
where \(M\) is Merill's marbles and \(E\) is Elliot's marbles.

Since Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, we can also write:

\[M = 2E\]

Now, we can substitute \(2E\) for \(M\) in the first equation:

\[2E + E = 45\]
\[3E = 45\]

Solving for \(E\), we get:

\[E = 15\]

This means Elliot has 15 marbles. Since Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot:

\[M = 2E = 2 \times 15 = 30\]

So, Merill has 30 marbles.

Let's define the number of marbles each person has based on the given information:

1. Let \( M \) be the number of marbles Merill has.
2. Let \( E \) be the number of marbles Elliot has.
3. Selma has 50 marbles.

The problem states that Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot. Therefore, we can write:
\[
M = 2E
\]

Additionally, the problem states that together Merill and Elliot have five fewer marbles than Selma. So we can write:
\[
M + E = 50 - 5
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
M + E = 45
\]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( M = 2E \)
2. \( M + E = 45 \)

We can substitute \( M \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
2E + E = 45
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
3E = 45
\]

Solving for \( E \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[
E = 15
\]

Now that we have \( E = 15 \), we can find \( M \) using the first equation:
\[
M = 2E = 2 \times 15 = 30
\]

Thus, Merill has 30 marbles.

Let's denote the number of marbles Elliot has as \( E \).

According to the problem, Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, so Merill has \( 2 \times E = 2E \) marbles.

The total number of marbles Merill and Elliot have together is \( 2E + E = 3E \).

We are told that together they have five fewer marbles than Selma. Since Selma has fifty marbles, the number of marbles Merill and Elliot have together is \( 50 - 5 = 45 \).

So we have the equation \( 3E = 45 \).

Solving for \( E \), we get:
\[ E = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Thus, Elliot has 15 marbles.

Since Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, Merill has \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) marbles.

Therefore, Merill has 30 marbles.

Let M be the number of marbles Merill has.

We are given two key pieces of information:
1. Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, so Elliot has M/2 marbles.
2. Together Merill and Elliot have 5 fewer marbles than Selma. Selma has 50 marbles, so in total, Merill and Elliot have 50-5 = 45 marbles.

We represent this as a pair of equations:
M + M/2 = 45

We will solve this equation to find out the number of marbles Merill has:
Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
2M + M = 90
Simplify:
3M = 90
Divide both sides by 3:
M/3 = 30
Multiply both sides by 3:
M = 90

Therefore, Merill has 90 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Merill has, we need to first determine the total number of marbles that Elliot and Merill have together and then subtract five from that total since Selma has five fewer marbles.

Let's denote the total number of marbles that Elliot and Merill have together as \( E + M \).

According to the problem, Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot. Therefore, we can write:
\[ M = 2E \]

We also know that together they have five fewer marbles than Selma, and Selma has 50 marbles:

Let's denote the number of marbles Merill has as \( M \) and the number of marbles Elliot has as \( E \).

According to the information given:

1) Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot:
\[ M = 2E \]

2) Together, Merill and Elliot have five fewer marbles than Selma:
Let's denote the total number of marbles Merill and Elliot have together as \( T \). According to the information given, \( T = S - 5 \), where \( S \) is the number of marbles Selma has.

Since Selma has fifty marbles, we have:
\[ E + M = 50 - 5 = 45 \] 

From this, we can substitute \( E \) with \( \frac{T}{2} \) to get:
\[ \frac{T}{2} + M = 45 \]

Since we know that \( T = E + M \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( E + M \) to get:
\[ \frac{E + M}{2} + M = 45 \]

Now, we can substitute \( M \) with \( 2E \) to get:
\[ \frac{E + 2E}{2} + 2E = 45 \]
\[ \frac{3E}{2} + 2E = 45 \]

Now, solve for \( E \):
\[ 3E + 4E = 90 \]
\[ 7E = 90 \]
\[ E = \frac{90}{7} \approx 12.857 \]

Now, we can find \( M \) using \( M = 2E \):
\[ M = 2 \times 12.857 \approx 25.714 \]

However, since the number of marbles must be a whole number, we need to check if the rounding affects the equation. In this case, the equation shows that Merill has approximately 25.714 marbles, which is not a whole number and does not match the context of the question.

Therefore, there is a mistake in the interpretation or the given information. We should recheck the steps and assumptions.

<answer>
The number of marbles Merill has should be rounded to a whole number. Let's solve the equation again:

Let's denote the number of marbles Merill has as \( M \) and the number of marbles Elliot has as \( E \).

1) Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot:
\[ M = 2E \]

2) Together, Merill and Elliot have 45 marbles (as calculated earlier):
\[ E + M = 45 \]

Substituting \( M \) with \( 2E \):
\[ E + 2E = 45 \]
\[ 3E = 45 \]
\[ E = 15 \]

Now, substitute \( E \) with \( 15 \) in \( M = 2E \):
\[ M = 2 \times 15 \]
\[ M = 30 \]

So, Merill has 30 marbles.
