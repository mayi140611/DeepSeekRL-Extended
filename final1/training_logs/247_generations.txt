system
Tony takes 2*3=6 pills each day in the first 2 days, which totals 6*2=12 pills. Then he takes half that amount, or 6/2=3 pills each day for the next 3 days, which totals 3*3=9 pills. In total, Tony has taken 12+9=21 pills in 5 days. On the sixth day he took 2 pills, which totals 21+2=23 pills. Since the bottle contained 50 pills, there are 50-23=27 pills left.

system
In the first 2 days, Tony takes 2 pills x 3 times a day = 6 pills per day.
So, in the first 2 days, Tony takes 6 pills/day x 2 days = 12 pills.
In the next 3 days, Tony takes half the amount of pills, so he takes 6 pills/ day x 0.5 = 3 pills per day.
So, in the next 3 days, Tony takes 3 pills/day x 3 days = 9 pills.
On the sixth day, Tony takes 2 pills.
In total, Tony has taken 12 pills + 9 pills + 2 pills = 23 pills.
So, 50 pills - 23 pills = 27 pills are left in the bottle.

Tony took 2 * 3 = 6 pills each day for the first 2 days. He took 6 * 2 = 12 pills in the first 2 days.
He then cut this amount in half, taking 6 / 2 = 3 pills each day for the next 3 days. He took 3 * 3 = 9 pills in the next 3 days.
In total, he took 12 + 9 = 21 pills.
On the sixth day, he took 2 pills, so he took 21 + 2 = 23 pills in total.

There were originally 50 pills in the bottle, so after Tony takes his pills he has 50 - 23 = 27 pills left in the bottle.

Tony takes 2 x 3 = 6 pills each day for the first 2 days.
In total, he takes 6 x 2 = 12 pills.
He reduces this to 2 x 1/2 = 1 pill each day for the next 3 days.
In total, he takes 1 x 3 = 3 pills.
He then takes 2 pills on the sixth day.
In total, he takes 12 + 3 + 2 = 17 pills.
Therefore, there are 50 - 17 = 33 pills left in the bottle.

system
Tony takes 2 x 3 = 6 pills each day for the first two days.
So in total, he takes 6 x 2 = 12 pills in the first two days.
Over the next three days, he takes in a day 2/3rd of the pills he took each day, so he takes 2 x 2/3 = 4 pills each day.
Over these three days, he takes 4 x 3 = 12 pills.
He also takes 2 pills on the sixth day.

So in total, he has taken 12 + 12 + 2 = 26 pills.

Therefore, there are 50 - 26 = 24 pills left in the bottle.

In the first 2 days, Tony takes 2 pills x 3 times a day = 6 pills per day.
So in the first 2 days, he takes 6 pills x 2 days = 12 pills.

Then he goes down to 1/2 of 6 pills, so 3 pills per day for the next 3 days.
So in the next 3 days, he takes 3 pills x 3 days = 9 pills.

So in total, Tony takes 12 + 9 = 21 pills.

Then he takes 2 pills in the morning on the sixth day, 2 + 0 = 2 pills.

So he takes 21 + 2 = 23 pills.

He started with 50 pills and took 23 pills, so 50 - 23 = 27 pills left.

Tony takes 2 pills three times a day for the first 2 days, which is 2*3=6 pills in total.
On the third day, he takes half of that at a quarter of this amount per day, which is 6/2=3+6/4=4.5, but since he can't take half a pill, he takes 3 pills.
On the sixth day, he takes 2 pills in the morning. This brings the total number of pills taken to 6+4.5+2=12.5.

He started with 50 pills, which means 50-12.5=37 pills left.

Tony takes 2 pills 3 times a day, so that's \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pills per day.
For the first 2 days, he takes 6 pills per day, so that's \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pills in total.
For the next 3 days, he takes half of that amount, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) pills per day.
So, over the next 3 days, he takes \(3 \times 3 = 9\) pills.

On the sixth day, he takes 2 pills in the morning.

So, he takes a total of \(12 + 9 + 2 = 23\) pills.

The bottle originally had 50 pills, so the number of pills left is \(50 - 23 = 27\).

Tony took 2 pills x 3 times/day = 6 pills each day for the first 2 days.
So he took a total of 6 pills/day x 2 days = 12 pills in the first 2 days.
After the first 2 days, he took half the amount, a total of 6 pills/night / 2 = 3 pills per night.
So for the next 3 days, he took a total of 3 pills x 3 nights = 9 pills.
He took 2 pills in the morning, making it 2 + 9 = 11 pills taken in total.
