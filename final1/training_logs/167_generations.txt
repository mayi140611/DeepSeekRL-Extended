Let's break this down step-by-step.

1. **Determine the length of Janet's previous film:**
   \[
   \text{Length of previous film} = 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Janet's new movie is 60% longer than her previous 2-hour long movie. 
   \[
   \text{Length increase} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   So, the new movie length:
   \[
   \text{Length of new movie} = 120 + 72 = 192 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost per minute for the previous movie:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per minute for the previous movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per minute for the newest movie:**
   According to the problem, the newest movie costs twice as much per minute as the previous movie:
   \[
   \text{Cost per minute for the newest movie} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost to film the newest movie:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Length of new movie} \times \text{Cost per minute for the newest movie}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 192 \text{ minutes} \times 100 \text{ dollars/minute}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 19200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Let's calculate the length of the new movie:
The previous movie is 2 hours long, which is 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes.
The new movie is 60% longer, which means it is 1. 6 * 120 minutes = 192 minutes long.

Now, calculate the cost per minute for the new movie:
The previous movie cost $50 per minute, so the newest movie's cost is 2 * $50 = $100 per minute.

Finally, calculate the total cost to film the newest movie:
The total cost is 192 minutes * $100 per minute = $19,200.

Let's denote the length of Janet's previous movie as \( L \). According to the problem, \( L = 2 \) hours, which is equal to \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The newest movie is 60% longer than her previous movie. Therefore, the length of the newest movie is:
\[ L_{\text{new}} = L + 0.6L = 1.6L \]
Substituting the value of \( L \):
\[ L_{\text{new}} = 1.6 \times 120 = 192 \text{ minutes} \]

The newest movie cost twice as much per minute to film as the previous movie. Let's denote the cost per minute of the previous movie as \( C \). The cost per minute of the newest movie is \( 2C \).

The total cost to film the newest movie is the product of its length and the cost per minute:
\[ \text{Total cost} = L_{\text{new}} \times 2C = 192 \times 2C = 384C \]

However, we are also given that the newest movie cost \( 50 \times 120 = 6000 \) dollars to film the previous movie. Since the cost per minute of the newest movie is twice the cost per minute of the previous movie, the amount of money \( 50 \) per minute is \( \frac{6000}{120} = 50 \) dollars per minute.

Since the newest movie's cost per minute is twice the cost per minute of the previous movie, the newest movie's cost per minute is \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) dollars per minute.

Therefore, the total cost to film the newest movie is:
\[ 192 \times 100 = 19200 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's find the length of Janet's newest movie first. Her previous movie is 2 hours long, or 120 minutes. Janet's newest movie is 60% longer, so it's 120 * 1.6 = 192 minutes long.
The cost to film the previous movie was $50 per minute, so for the newest movie which cost twice as much per minute, it was $50 * 2 = $100 per minute to film.
To find the total amount of money required to film the newest movie, we multiply the cost per minute by the length of the movie in minutes, which is $100 * 192 = $19,200.

Janet's previous movie is 2 hours long, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes long.
The newest film is 60% longer than the previous movie, which is 120 * 60% = 72 minutes longer.
The newest film is therefore 120 + 72 = 192 minutes long.
The cost per minute to film the newest movie is twice the cost of the previous movie, which is 50 * 2 = $100 per minute.
The total cost of filming the newest movie is 192 * 100 = $19,200.

To determine the total cost to film the newest movie, we need to calculate the length of the newest movie and then use the given cost per minute to film it.

1. Calculate the length of Janet's newest movie:
   - Janet's previous movie was 2 hours long.
   - The newest movie is 60% longer than the previous one.
   - Length of the newest movie = 2 hours * (1 + 60/100) = 2 * 1.6 = 3.2 hours.

2. Convert the length of the newest movie from hours to minutes:
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes.
   - 3.2 hours = 3.2 * 60 = 192 minutes.

3. Calculate the cost per minute to film the newest movie:
   - The cost per minute for the previous movie was $50.
   - The newest movie costs twice as much per minute.
   - Cost per minute for the newest movie = $50 * 2 = $100.

4. Calculate the total cost to film the newest movie:
   - Total cost = length of the newest movie in minutes * cost per minute.
   - Total cost = 192 minutes * $100/minute = $19,200.

5. Verify the cost calculation:
   - Check the cost calculation for the original movie.
   - Cost of the original movie = previous movie length in minutes * cost per minute.
   - Cost of the original movie = 120 minutes * $50/minute = $6,000.
   - Yes, the newest movie costs twice as much per minute, confirming our total cost calculation.

6. Determine the final amount required to film the newest film:
   - The total amount required = cost per minute * length of the newest movie in minutes.
   - Total amount required = $100/minute * 192 minutes = $19,200.

Let's denote the original movie duration as \(2\) hours, which is \(120\) minutes. The newest movie is \(60\%\) longer than the original movie. Therefore, the duration of the newest movie is:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 0.60 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 192 \text{ minutes} \]

The cost per minute for the newest movie is twice the cost per minute for the original movie. Given that the original movie cost \( \$50 \) per minute, the newest movie costs:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ dollars/minute} = 100 \text{ dollars/minute} \]

To find the total cost to film the newest movie, we multiply its length in minutes by its cost per minute:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the length of the new movie:**
   - Janet's previous movie was 2 hours long.
   - The new movie is 60% longer than the previous one.

   First, find 60% of 2 hours:
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 2 \text{ hours} = 0.60 \times 2 = 1.2 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Add this to the original length:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} + 1.2 \text{ hours} = 3.2 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Convert hours to minutes:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Calculate the total number of minutes in 3.2 hours:
   \[
   3.2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 192 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per minute for the previous movie:**
   - The previous movie cost $50 per minute.

4. **Calculate the cost per minute for the new movie:**
   - The new movie costs twice as much per minute as the previous one:
   \[
   2 \times 50 \text{ dollars/minute} = 100 \text{ dollars/minute}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of filming the new movie:**
   - Multiply the total number of minutes by the cost per minute:
   \[
   192 \text{ minutes} \times 100 \text{ dollars/minute} = 19200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film is \( \boxed{19200} \) dollars.

2. The newest movie is 60% longer than the previous one.
3. The cost to film her previous movie was $50 per minute.
4. The newest movie costs twice as much per minute to film as the previous movie.

Now, we can calculate the length of the newest movie in minutes:

Length of previous movie: 120 minutes
Percentage increase: 60%
Length of newest movie = Length of previous movie + (Length of previous movie * Percentage increase)
Length of newest movie = 120 + (120 * 0.60)

Length of newest movie = 192 minutes

Now, let's calculate the cost to film the newest movie:

Cost per minute of previous movie: $50
Cost per minute of newest movie: 2 * $50 = $100
