First, let's calculate the average price of a class in the pack. 
The total cost for the 10 classes is $75. So, the average price of a class is $75 / 10 = $7.5.
Ruby wants to take 13 total classes. If she takes 13 total classes, then she will have 1 additional class beyond the pack of 10 classes. 
The additional classes will cost 1/3 more than the average price of a class in the pack. 
So, the additional classes will cost 7.5 + (1/3 * 7.5) = $9.
The total cost for the 13 classes will be the cost of the pack of 10 classes plus the cost of the additional 3 classes.
So, Ruby will pay $75 + $9 = $84.

Ruby buys a class pack of 10 classes for $75. She then adds 3 additional classes. The price of a regular class is $75/10 = $7.50.
So the price of one additional class is $7.50 + ($7.50 * 1/3) = $10. 

Therefore, the total cost is $75 + $10 X 3 = $105.

To determine the total cost, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

1. The cost of the initial pack of 10 classes is $75.
2. The additional classes have a price that is 1/3 more than the average price of a class in the initial pack.
3. To find the average price of a class in the initial pack, we divide the cost by the number of classes:
   $75 / 10 = $7.50 per class.
4. The price of an additional class is 1/3 more than $7.50:
   (1 + 1/3) * $7.50 = (4/3) * $7.50 = $10.
5. With 3 additional classes at $10 each, the total cost for these classes is 3 * $10 = $30.
6. Adding the cost of the initial pack of classes:
   $75 + $30 = $105.

Therefore, Ruby pays a total of $105 for 13 classes.

To find out how much Ruby will pay for 13 total classes, let's break down the cost step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the average price of a class in the pack. Since the pack costs $75 for 10 classes, we divide the total cost by the number of classes:
   \[
   \text{Average class price} = \frac{75}{10} = 7.5
   \]

2. Ruby wants to take a total of 13 classes. So she needs to take 3 additional classes beyond the initial pack of 10 classes. However, since we're dealing with real-world scenarios, we should consider the additional classes as part of the pack. Therefore, we'll treat the 3 additional classes as part of the initial pack.

3. Now, to find the price of an additional class, we need to calculate 1/3 more than the average class price in the pack:
   \[
   \text{Additional class price} = \text{Average class price} + \left(\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Average class price}\right) = 7.5 + \left(\frac{1}{3} \times 7.5\right)
   \]
   \[
   = 7.5 + 2.5 = 10
   \]

4. Now, let's calculate the cost for the initial pack of 10 classes:
   \[
   \text{Cost of initial pack} = 10 \times 7.5 = 75
   \]

5. Then, let's calculate the cost for the additional 3 classes:
   \[
   \text{Cost of additional classes} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

6. Adding both together, we get the total amount Ruby will pay for 13 classes:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 75 + 30 = 105
   \]

So, Ruby will pay $105 for 13 classes.

First, let's calculate the average price of a class in the pack. This is the cost of 10 classes divided by 10, which is $75 / 10 = $7.50.
Now, we need to consider the cost of the additional classes. She can add an additional class at 1/3 more than the average price of a class in the pack. This is $7.50 * (1 + 1/3) = $10.00.
Since she takes 13 total classes, she adds 3 additional classes. So, the cost for 3 additional classes is 3 * $10.00 = $30.00.
Now, we add the cost of the original 10 classes and the cost of the 3 additional classes to get the total cost. The total cost is $75 + $30.00 = $105.00.

First, let's calculate the cost of one class in the pack.

The cost of one class is $75 / 10 = $7.50.

Now, let's find the additional class cost. We know that it's 1/3 more than the average price of a class in the pack. 

The additional class cost is $7.50 * (1 + 1/3) = $7.50 * (4/3) = $10.

So, the cost of each additional class is $7.50 + $10 = $17.50.

Now let's calculate the cost for the additional classes.

The cost for 3 additional classes is 3 * $17.50 = $52.50.

Ruby also takes 10 classes in the pack. So, the cost for the pack is $7.50 * 10 = $75.

So, the total cost is $75 for the pack + $52.50 for the additional classes = $127.50.

Therefore, Ruby pays $127.50 in total for 13 total classes.

First, let's determine the cost of one class in the initial pack of 10 classes. The cost is $75 for 10 classes, so the cost per class is $75 / 10 = $7.50.

The price for additional classes is 1/3 more than the average price of a class in the pack. So, the increase in price is $7.50 * 1/3 = $2.50.

Therefore, the cost of an additional class is $7.50 + $2.50 = $10.

Ruby takes 13 total classes, which means she is paying for 13 - 10 = 3 additional classes.

The total cost for these 3 additional classes is 3 * $10 = $30.

Adding the cost for the initial 10 classes, Ruby pays a total of $75 + $30 = $105.

Therefore, we can say: Ruby pays $105 for the 13 classes.

To determine the total cost of Ruby's dance lessons, we need to calculate the cost of the initial 10 classes and the additional classes she takes.

First, we find the cost per class in the pack:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{75}{10} = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of each additional class:
\[ \text{Additional class cost} = 7.5 + \frac{7.5}{3} = 7.5 + 2.5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know Ruby takes 13 classes in total, consisting of 10 classes initially in the pack and 3 additional classes:
\[ \text{Total additional classes} = 13 - 10 = 3 \]
\[ \text{Total additional cost} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the initial 10 classes and the additional 3 classes:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 75 + 30 = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Ruby pays $105 in total for her dance lessons.

Now we know that Ruby took 9 classes in the pack and 4 additional classes. The cost for the 9 classes is 9 * $7.50 = $67.50. The cost for the 4 additional classes is 4 * $10 = $40.

To determine how much Ruby pays for 13 total classes, we first need to find the cost of each class in the pack and then calculate the cost of all the additional classes. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Cost of the pack**: The pack consists of 10 classes. The cost for this pack is $75.
   
2. **Cost per class in the pack**: We divide the total cost of the pack by the number of classes in the pack:
   \[
   \text{Cost per class in the pack} = \frac{75}{10} = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Additional classes**: Ruby needs to take an additional 3 classes, one of which is already included in the pack. Therefore, she needs to buy the additional 2 classes.

4. **Average cost per class in the pack**: The pack is structured such that each class costs 1/3 more than the average cost.

   \[
   \text{Average cost per class in the pack} = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{1/3 more than the average cost per class} = 7.5 + \frac{7.5}{3} = 7.5 + 2.5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of additional classes**: Since Ruby is buying two classes that already have the same price as the average (which is just the cost per class in the pack), they will also cost $7.5 each.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost of one additional class} = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Cost of two additional classes} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total cost**: The total cost is the sum of the cost of the two additional classes and the cost of the pack (since the pack itself costs $75 and she doesn't need to pay more than that).

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 + 75 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Ruby pays $90 for 13 total classes.

To determine how much Ruby pays for 13 total classes, we first need to calculate the cost per class in the initial pack.

The cost for 10 classes is $75. Therefore, the cost per class in the pack is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{75}{10} = 7.5 \, \text{dollars per class} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the additional classes. The problem states that an additional class costs $1/3 more than the average price of a class in the pack. Therefore, the additional cost per class is:
\[ \text{Additional cost per class} = 7.5 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{3}\right) = 7.5 \times \frac{4}{3} = 10 \, \text{dollars per additional class} \]

Since Ruby will take 3 additional classes, the total cost for the additional classes is:
\[ \text{Total cost for additional classes} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the initial pack of 10 classes to the cost of the additional classes to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 75 + 30 = 105 \, \text{dollars} \]

To determine how much Ruby will pay for 13 classes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average price per class in the pack of 10 classes.
2. Determine the price of each additional class.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 13 classes.

First, let's find the average price per class in the pack of 10 classes. The total cost for 10 classes is $75, so the average price per class is:
\[ \text{Average price per class} = \frac{75}{10} = 7.5 \]

Next, we calculate the price of each additional class. The price of each additional class is 1/3 more than the average price of $7.5, so:
\[ \text{Additional price} = 7.5 + \frac{1}{3} \times 7.5 = 7.5 + 2.5 = 10 \]

Since Ruby is taking 13 classes, which includes the pack of 10 classes at a discounted price and additional classes, we need to calculate the cost as follows:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{(Price of 10 classes)} + (2 \times \text{Additional price}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 75 + (2 \times 10) = 75 + 20 = 95 \]

Thus, Ruby will pay a total of $95 for 13 classes.

To determine how much Ruby pays for 13 total classes, we need to calculate the cost of a single class in the pack first.

The cost of 10 classes is $75, so the average cost of a class in the pack is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Average cost per class} = \frac{\$75}{10 \text{ classes}} = \$7.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one additional class. It is \( \frac{1}{3} \) more than the average price of a class in the pack, which means:
\[ \text{Additional class cost} = \$7.50 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{3}\right) = \$7.50 \times \frac{4}{3} = \$10 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 13 classes is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for 10 classes} + \text{Cost for 3 additional classes} = \$75 + \$3 \times \$10 = \$75 + \$30 = \$105 \]

First, we need to calculate the average price per class in the pack. This will be the total cost divided by the number of classes in the pack. The total cost of the pack is $75 for 10 classes, which means the average price per class in the pack is $75/10 = $7.50.

Next, we calculate the price of an additional class. This is 1/3 more than the average price per class in the pack, so the price of one additional class is $7.50 + (1/3 * $7.50) = $7.50 + $2.50 = $10.00.

Now, we figure out how many additional classes Ruby takes beyond the initial 10. Ruby takes a total of 13 classes, so she takes 13 - 10 = 3 additional classes.

The total cost for the initial 10 classes is $75, and the cost for the additional 3 classes is 3 * $10.00 = $30.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost: $75 + $30.00 = $105.00.

To determine how much Ruby pays for 13 total classes, we first need to calculate the price of one class and then find the cost of the additional classes beyond the initial 10 classes.

First, let's find the price of one class in the pack. The pack costs $75 for 10 classes. Thus, the price per class is:
\[ \text{Price per class} = \frac{75}{10} = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Ruby is taking 13 total classes. Out of these, she takes 10 regular classes (from the pack) and 3 additional classes.

The cost for the 3 additional classes is:
\[ \text{Cost for additional classes} = 3 \times (7.5 + 1/3 \times 7.5) \]

First, calculate \(1/3\) of the price of one class:
\[ \frac{7.5}{3} = 2.5 \]

Then add this to the regular price per class to get the increased price for the additional classes:
\[ 7.5 + 2.5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, multiply this by the number of additional classes:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for all 13 classes is:
\[ 75 + 30 = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

So the total amount Ruby pays is $105.

Ruby is purchasing a pack of 10 dance classes for a total of $75. This pack has an average price of $75 / 10 = $7.5 per class.

To find the price of an additional class, we need to calculate 1/3 more than the average price of a class in the pack. 1/3 more than $7.5 is $7.5 + (1/3 * $7.5) = $7.5 + $2.5 = $10 per additional class.

The total cost of the additional classes is $10 * (13 - 10) = $30.
