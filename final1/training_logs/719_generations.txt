To find out how many bags of chips John ate, we need to perform a simple arithmetic operation.

First, we know that John eats a bag of chips for dinner.
After dinner, he eats twice as many as he ate for dinner. Since a bag of chips is considered "one" unit, adding two more bags would make a total of two units.

Adding these two units:
1 (from dinner) + 2 (additional bags) = 3 units or bags of chips.

Therefore, the total number of bags of chips John ate is 3.

Let's denote the number of bags of chips John eats for dinner as \( x \).

According to the problem, John eats twice as many chips after dinner. So, the number of chips he eats after dinner is \( 2x \).

The total number of bags of chips John eats is the sum of the chips for dinner and after dinner:
\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

To find the exact number of bags, we need to know the value of \( x \). However, since \( x \) is not specified, we can only express the total in terms of \( x \). 

If \( x \) were given, say, 1 bag of chips for dinner, then \( 2x \) would be 2 bags for after dinner, and the total would be 3 bags.

To find out how many bags of chips John ate, we need to consider the number of bags he ate for dinner and the additional bags he ate after dinner. Since John ate twice as many after dinner as he did for dinner, we can set up the equation:

Let \( x \) represent the number of bags of chips John ate for dinner. Then, after dinner, he ate \( 2x \) bags of chips. Therefore, the total number of bags of chips he ate is:

Total bags of chips = \( x + 2x \)

Simplifying this expression:

\( x + 2x = 3x \)

So, John ate 3 times the number of bags he ate for dinner.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of bags of chips John ate for dinner as \( x \). According to the problem, he eats twice as many after dinner. Therefore, the number of bags of chips he eats after dinner is \( 2x \).

The total number of bags of chips John ate is the sum of the bags eaten for dinner and the bags eaten after dinner, which is \( x + 2x \).

Combining like terms, the total number of bags is \( 3x \).

However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Typically, when dealing with problems like this, the bag of chips counts is already given in the prompt. Based on the information provided, if he initially ate one bag for dinner, and twice as many after dinner, then the total amount is three bags.

Thus, the total number of bags of chips John ate is 3.

<reasoning>
To determine how many bags of chips John ate, we start by identifying the number of bags he ate for dinner. We know that he ate one bag of chips for dinner. 

After dinner, he eats twice as many bags of chips. Since he ate one bag for dinner, after dinner he eats \(2 \times 1 = 2\) bags. 

Adding these together, the total number of bags of chips John ate is \(1 + 2 = 3\).

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of bags of chips John eats for dinner as \( x \). According to the problem, John eats twice as many bags of chips after dinner, which means he eats \( 2x \) bags of chips after dinner. 

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ x + 2x = \text{total number of bags of chips eaten} \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = \text{total number of bags of chips eaten} \]

Since we do not have the specific number of chips \( x \) that John eats for dinner, the total number of bags of chips eaten is \( 3x \).

To find the exact number, we need the value of \( x \). If we assume \( x = 1 \) (a common assumption when no other information is given), then \( x = 1 \) bag of chips for dinner and \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) bags after dinner, making a total of \( 1 + 2 = 3 \) bags. 

So, \( 3x = 3 \) bags.

However, if \( x \) is different from 1, we would need the exact value of \( x \) to solve for \( 3x \). Without the specific amount of chips per serving, we cannot provide a definitive number of bags John ate.

Let's denote the number of bags of chips John ate for dinner as \( x \). According to the problem, after dinner, he eats twice as many bags of chips. Therefore, the number of bags of chips he ate after dinner is \( 2x \).

The total number of bags of chips John ate is the sum of the bags he ate for dinner and after dinner. So, we have:
\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

Since the number of bags he ate is equal to the value of \( x \), we can conclude that John ate 3 bags of chips in total.

To determine the total number of bags of chips John ate, we can start by defining the number of bags he ate for dinner. Let's say he ate 1 bag of chips for dinner. According to the problem, he eats twice as many bags after dinner. So if he ate 1 bag for dinner, he would eat \(1 \times 2 = 2\) bags after dinner.

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total number of bags of chips he ate:
\[ 1 \text{ bag} + 2 \text{ bags} = 3 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, John ate 3 bags of chips in total.

Let's denote the number of bags of chips John ate for dinner as \( x \).

According to the problem, after dinner, he ate twice as many bags of chips, which can be represented as \( 2x \).

So, the total number of bags of chips he ate is the sum of the bags he ate for dinner and the bags he ate after dinner:
\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

This means John ate \( 3x \) bags of chips in total.

However, we don't have the value of \( x \), so without further information, we cannot determine the exact number of bags John ate. The number of bags \( x \) depends on his specific habits or the specific bags he consumed during dinner and after dinner.

To determine the total number of bags of chips John ate, we start by noting that he consumes one bag of chips for dinner. After dinner, he eats twice as many chips as he did for dinner. Therefore, John eats an additional:

\[ 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ bags of chips} \]

Adding the chips eaten for dinner:
