John's website generates 30000 visits per month, which means he generates $30000 * 30 = $900000 per month. 
To find out how much he makes per day, we'll take the total amount he generates per month and divide it by the number of days in a month: $900000 / 30 = $30000 per day.

To determine how much John makes per day, we need to calculate the total monthly earnings and then divide that by the number of days in the month.

First, let's calculate total monthly earnings:
\[ \text{Total monthly visits} = 30000 \text{ visits} \]
\[ \text{Earnings per visit} = \$0.01 \]
\[ \text{Total monthly earnings} = 30000 \text{ visits} \times \$0.01/\text{visit} = \$300 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days in a month:
\[ \text{Days in a month} = 30 \]

Now, we can find the earnings per day by dividing the total monthly earnings by the number of days in the month:
\[ \text{Earnings per day} = \frac{\$300}{30 \text{ days}} \]

We perform the division:
\[ \text{Earnings per day} = \$10 \]

Therefore, John makes \$10 per day.

To find out how much John makes per day, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a day based on his total monthly earnings.
2. Divide the monthly earnings by the number of days in a month to find the daily earnings.

Given:
- John's website gets 30000 visits a month.
- He earns $0.01 per visit.
- There are 30 days in a month.

Total monthly earnings = 30000 visits * $0.01/visit = $300.
Number of days in a month = 30.

Total daily earnings = $300 / 30 = $10.

So, John makes $10 per day.

To determine how much John makes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's monthly earnings by multiplying the number of visits per month by the earnings per visit.
2. Divide the monthly earnings by the number of days in a month to find out how much he makes per day.

Let's do the calculation:
- Number of visitors per month = 30000
- Earnings per visit = $0.01
- Number of days in a month = 30

First, calculate John's monthly earnings:
\( 30000 \text{ visits/month} \times $0.01/\text{visit} = $300 \text{ per month} \)

Next, calculate earnings per day:
\( \frac{$300}{30 \text{ days/month}} = $10 \text{ per day} \)

Therefore, John makes $10 per day.

To find out how much John makes per day, we first need to calculate his monthly earnings and then divide by the number of days in a month. The steps are as follows:

1. Calculate monthly earnings: Multiply the number of visits per month by the amount earned per visit.
2. Calculate daily earnings: Divide the monthly earnings by the number of days in a month.

Let's break it down:
1. Monthly earnings = 30,000 visits/month * $0.01/visit
2. Daily earnings = Monthly earnings / 30 days

These steps can be implemented as a simple calculation in a programming script or directly calculated:

Let's first calculate the monthly earnings. John makes $0.01 per visit, and he gets 30,000 visits per month.

Therefore, he earns $0.01 Ã— 30,000 = $300 per month.

Next, we need to divide this total monthly earnings by the number of days in a month. Since there are 30 days in a month, we calculate as follows:

$300 / 30 days = $10 per day.

In a month, there are 30 days. John gets 30000 visits per month, and each visit earns him $0.01. So, to calculate the total amount he makes in a month, we multiply the number of visits by the earnings per visit:

$$
30000 \text{ visits} \times $0.01 \text{ per visit} = $300 \text{ per month}
$$

To find out how much John makes per day, we divide the monthly earnings by the number of days in the month:

$$

To determine how much John makes per day, we first need to calculate his total monthly earnings from the visits. 

He earns $0.01 per visit and gets 30,000 visits per month. So, his total monthly earnings can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = 30000 \text{ visits} \times \$0.01/\text{visit} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = \$300 \]

Next, we need to convert the monthly earnings into a daily amount by dividing by the number of days in the month. Assuming a month is 30 days:

\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = \frac{\$300}{30 \text{ days}} \]

\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = \$10 \]

Therefore, John earns $10 per day.

John's website generates $0.01 per visit, and there are 30 million visits per month (300,000 visits per day * 30 days).

To calculate the total monthly income, multiply the visits per month by the amount earned per visit:

$0.01 per visit * 3,000,000 visits = $30,000 per month.

Next, to calculate John's daily earnings, divide the monthly income by the number of days in the month:

$30,000 per month / 30 days = $1000 per day.

To find out how much John makes per day, we need to divide the total amount he earns per month by the number of days in a month and then by the number of visits he gets per day.

1. Total monthly earnings = $30000
2. Number of days in a month = 30
3. Visits per day = Total visits / 30 days

Now, let's calculate the visits per day:

Visits per day = 30000 / 30 = 1000 visits per day

Next, we calculate the earnings per day:

Earnings per day = Earnings per visit * Number of visits per day * Number of days in a month

Earnings per day = $0.01/visit * 1000 visits/day * 30 days

Earnings per day = $30

So, John makes $30 per day.
