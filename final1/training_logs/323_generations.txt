###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Jay & Gloria were hosting a 4th of July party at their house.  Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36.  They wanted to buy small American flags for everyone.  The craft store was having a sale on small flags, 5 flags for $1.00.  If they wanted all of their guests to have a flag and they also wanted 1 flag each, how much would they spend at the craft store?

system
First, we need to determine the total number of people that Jay and Gloria invited, plus themselves. 

Jay invited 22 people, Gloria invited 36 people, and they each wanted a flag as well. So, we add 1 person to each of the total invited guests:

22 (Jay) + 36 (Gloria) + 1 (Jay) + 1 (Gloria) = 60 people

Next, we need to figure out how many small flags they need. Since each flag represents one person, they need 60 flags.

The craft store is offering 5 flags for $1.00. To find out how many sets of 5 flags they can get for one dollar, we divide the total number of flags by 5:

60 flags ÷ 5 flags/set = 12 sets

Now, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of sets by the price of each set:

12 sets × $1.00/set = $12.00

Therefore, they would spend $12 at the craft store.

They need a flag for 22 + 36 = 58 guests.
They need 1 = of a flag for themselves.
So they need 58 + 1 = 59 flags.
The will have 59 - 5 = 54 flags left after everyone gets a flag and Jay and Gloria get a flag each.

At $1 for 5 flags, they would spend 54/5 = $10.80 at the craft store.

First find the total number of people: 22 people + 36 people = 58 people
Then find the number of people they want a flag for: 58 people + 2 flags = 60 flags
Then divide that number by the number of flags you get for $1.00 to find how many dollars they spend: 60 flags / 5 flags / $1.00 = $12.00

To determine how much Jay and Gloria would spend at the craft store, we need to calculate the total number of flags they need and then figure out how many sets of 5 flags they can buy with their limited budget.

First, calculate the total number of guests:
Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36 people, so the total number of guests is:
\[ 22 + 36 = 58 \]

They also want one flag each, so the total number of flags needed is:
\[ 58 + 2 = 60 \]

Next, we need to determine how many sets of 5 flags are needed to get at least 60 flags:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{60}{5} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 12 \right\rceil = 12 \]
where \(\left\lceil x \right\rceil\) denotes the ceiling function, which rounds up to the nearest whole number.

Now, calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:
\[ 12 \times 1.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total amount they would spend at the craft store is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]

\[ 12.00 \]

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of flags needed and then determine the total cost based on the sale price.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests:
- Jay invited 22 people.
- Gloria invited 36 people.
- Including Jay and Gloria themselves, the total number of guests is \(22 + 36 + 2 = 60\).

Next, we need to find out how many flags are needed for the guests:
Since they want at least one flag per guest and assume they will want flags for their guests as well:
\[ \text{Total flags needed} = \text{Total guests} = 60 \]

Now, considering the sale price:
The shop is offering 5 flags for $1.00, which means each flag costs $0.20 (since \( \frac{1.00}{5} = 0.20 \)).

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of flags by the price per flag:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total flags needed} \times \text{Price per flag} = 60 \times 0.20 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for the flags is $12.00.

To determine how much Jay & Gloria would spend, we need to calculate the total number of flags required and then determine the cost based on the sale price.

1. Calculate the total number of flags needed:
   - Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36 people, so there are \(22 + 36 = 58\) people.
   - They also want 1 flag each for themselves, so that's an additional 2 flags.
   - Therefore, the total number of flags needed is \(58 + 2 = 60\).

2. Determine the cost of the flags:
   - The craft store is selling 5 flags for $1.00.
   - To find out how many sets of 5 flags they need, we divide the total number of flags by 5: \(60 \div 5 = 12\).
   - Since each set of 5 flags costs $1.00, the total cost is \(12 \times 1.00 = 12.00\).

3. The total amount they would spend at the craft store is $12.00.

First, let's determine the total number of guests. Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36 people, so together they invited:

\[ 22 + 36 = 58 \]

They also wanted 1 flag each, so that's:

\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]

Adding these together, the total number of flags needed is:

\[ 58 + 2 = 60 \]

Next, let's determine how many sets of 5 flags they need to buy. Since each set of 5 flags costs $1.00, the number of sets needed is:

\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set:

\[ 12 \times 1.00 = 12.00 \]

So, they would spend:

The total number of people attending the party is the sum of Jay's guests and Gloria's guests, which is 22 + 36 = 58 people.

Since each person needs one flag and they also want 1 flag each, they need 58 + 2 = 60 flags in total.

The craft store sells flags at a rate of 5 flags for $1.00.

To find out how many sets of 5 flags they need, we divide the total number of flags by 5: 60 / 5 = 12 sets.

Since each set of 5 flags costs $1.00, they would spend 12 * $1.00 = $12.00.

To determine how much Jay and Gloria would spend at the craft store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guests and themselves who would get a flag.
2. Determine how many sets of 5 flags they need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the sale price of 5 flags for $1.00.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of guests and themselves who would get a flag.
Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36 people. Including Jay and Gloria, the total number of flags needed is:
\[ 22 + 36 + 2 = 60 \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 5 flags they need.
Since they need 60 flags, we divide 60 by 5:
\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Since 5 flags cost $1.00, 12 sets of 5 flags will cost:
\[ 12 \times 1 = 12 \]

Therefore, Jay and Gloria would spend $12 at the craft store.

To determine how much Jay & Gloria will spend at the craft store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of people who will need flags.
2. Determine how many sets of 5 flags they need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the cost per set of flags.

First, calculate the total number of people:
\[ 22 \text{ (Jay's guests)} + 36 \text{ (Gloria's guests)} = 58 \text{ people} \]

Next, determine how many sets of 5 flags they need:
\[ 58 \div 5 = 11 \text{ sets with a remainder of } 3 \]

They need 11 complete sets of 5 flags, which costs:
\[ 11 \times 1 = \$11.00 \]

Since they also want 1 flag each, they need an additional 5 flags, which cost:
\[ 5 \times \frac{1}{5} = \$1.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \$11.00 + \$1.00 = \$12.00 \]

So, Jay & Gloria would spend \$12.00 at the craft store.

The total number of people who will receive a flag is Jay's 22 guests + Gloria's 36 guests + both Jay and Gloria, which equals 60 people. 

Since they want 1 flag for each of these 60 people, they need 60 flags.

The craft store sells 5 flags for $1.00, so for 60 flags, they would need 60 / 5 = 12 sets of 5 flags.

Therefore, they would spend 12 * $1.00 = $12.00.

The total number of people at the party is 22 (Jay's guests) + 36 (Gloria's guests) + 2 (Jay and Gloria) = 60 people. They want each person to have one flag, and they want an additional flag for themselves. So, the total number of flags needed is 60 + 1 = 61 flags.

First, let's calculate the total number of flags needed for all guests. Jay invited 22 people, Gloria invited 36 people, and they wanted 1 flag each. So, the total number of flags needed is:

22 (Jay's guests) + 36 (Gloria's guests) + 2 (Jay and Gloria) = 60 flags

Now, since the craft store is selling 5 flags for $1.00, we need to determine how many sets of 5 flags are needed to get 60 flags. 

Since 5 flags cost $1.00, we divide the total number of flags needed by 5:

60 flags ÷ 5 flags/set = 12 sets

Now, to find out how much they would spend, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set:

12 sets × $1.00/set = $12.00

So, they would spend $12.00 at the craft store.
