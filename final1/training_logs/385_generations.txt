###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

When the strawberries at Fruity Farm are ready for harvest, Miguel charges each interested picker $4 to access the strawberry fields. Once there, people pick as many strawberries as they wish, and then take them to Miguel for weighing and pricing. This year, the standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20. Miguel is a very generous man. He deducts the entrance charge from the cost of the harvest. Sally, Jenny and Moses have just finished their strawberry picking and are headed home. They paid $128 for their harvest. How many pounds of strawberry did they pick?

Let's denote the number of pounds of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses as \( x \).

Given:
- Entrance charge per person: $4
- Price per pound of strawberries: $20
- Total amount paid by Sally, Jenny, and Moses: $128

First, calculate the total cost for entrance fees:

\[
\text{Total entrance fees} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total amount paid for strawberries is $128, which includes the entrance fees. Therefore, the cost of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses is:

\[
\text{Cost of strawberries} = \$128 - \$12 = 116 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we know the price per pound of strawberries is $20. To find the number of pounds \( x \) of strawberries picked, we use the equation:

\[
20x = 116
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{116}{20} = 5.8
\]

Since the number of pounds must be a whole number, and strawberry harvesting typically involves whole pounds, we round 5.8 to the nearest whole number:

\[
x = 6
\]

Therefore, Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked a total of 6 pounds of strawberries.

Let's calculate the total cost for the three pickers before the entrance charges were deducted.

The standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20, and the total cost they paid is $128. 

Total cost without entrance charges = Standard price per pound * Number of pounds picked
$128 = $20 * Number of pounds picked
Number of pounds picked = $128 / $20
Number of pounds picked = 6.4 pounds

Since Miguel deducts the entrance charge, we need to subtract the entrance charges from the total amount.

Total entrance charge = Entrance price per person * Number of people
Total entrance charge = $4 * 3
Total entrance charge = $12

Now, we subtract the entrance charge from the total amount.

Total cost after entrance charges = Total cost without entrance charges - Total entrance charge
Total cost after entrance charges = $128 - $12
Total cost after entrance charges = $116

Now, we can calculate the total number of pounds they picked, which is now the total cost after the entrance charge has been deducted.

Total number of pounds picked = Total cost after entrance charges
Total number of pounds picked = $116

Therefore, they picked 116 pounds of strawberries.

Let's denote the total pounds of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses as \( x \).

First, we know the entrance fee is $4 per person. Since there are three people (Sally, Jenny, and Moses), the total entrance fee is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Miguel will subtract this entrance fee from the total cost of the strawberries, so the cost of the strawberries after deducting the entrance fee is:
\[ 128 - 12 = 116 \text{ dollars} \]

The standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20. To find out how many pounds of strawberries they picked, we divide the total cost of the strawberries by the standard price per pound:
\[ \frac{116}{20} = 5.8 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, they picked 5.8 pounds of strawberries.

Let's denote the total cost of a pound of strawberries as $20, and the entrance charge as $4 per person.

Since Sally, Jenny, and Moses are three people, the entrance charges are:
3 people * $4/person = $12

Now, the total amount paid is $128, which includes the entrance charges. So, the amount that went towards the strawberries after deducting the entrance charges is:
$128 - $12 = $116

Each pound of strawberries costs $20, so the number of pounds they picked is:
$116 / $20/pound = 5.8 pounds

Since you can't pick a fraction of a pound, and Sally, Jenny, and Moses are the ones who paid, they picked 5 pounds of strawberries.

Let's denote the number of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses as \( S \). Since the entrance charge is $4 per person and they all contributed the same amount, the total entrance charge for the three of them is \( 4 \times 3 = $12 \).

Since the cost of strawberries is $20 per pound, the total cost for \( S \) pounds of strawberries is \( 20S \).

According to the information given, they paid $128 for their harvest after the entrance charge. Therefore, the cost paid for strawberries, including the entrance charge, is:
\[ 20S + 12 = 128 \]

Subtracting the entrance charge from the total cost gives us the cost of strawberries:
\[ 20S = 128 - 12 \]
\[ 20S = 116 \]

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us the number of pounds picked:
\[ S = \frac{116}{20} \]
\[ S = 5.8 \]

However, since they can't pick a fraction of a pound of strawberries, it implies that they picked 5 full pounds of strawberries because they cannot pick a fraction of a pound in practical terms.

Therefore, Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked 5 pounds of strawberries.

Let's denote the number of pounds of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses as \(x\).

First, we determine the total entrance charge for Miguel. Since each person pays $4 to enter the fields, the total entrance charge is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the strawberries picked, which we will call \(P\). According to the problem, the total cost, including the entrance charge, is $128. Therefore, we have:
\[ 12 + P = 128 \]
Solving for \(P\), we get:
\[ P = 128 - 12 = 116 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of strawberries per pound is $20. So, the total number of pounds of strawberries picked is:
\[ \frac{P}{20} = \frac{116}{20} = 5.8 \text{ pounds} \]

However, since Miguel subtracts the entrance charge from the total cost, the actual number of pounds picked is:
\[ x - 12 \]
Since \(x\) is the total pounds picked, we need to find \(x\) such that:
\[ P = 20x \]
From \(P = 116\), we have:
\[ 20x = 116 \]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[ x = \frac{116}{20} = 5.8 \]

Therefore, the total pounds of strawberries picked is:
\[ 5.8 - 12 = 12 - 5.8 = 6.2 \]

So, the total pounds of strawberries picked is:
\[ \boxed{6.2} \]

Let's denote the number of pounds of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses as \( x \).

The cost to access the strawberry fields is $4 for each person, so the total entrance fee for Sally, Jenny, and Moses is \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) dollars.

The cost of the strawberries is $20 per pound. So, if they picked \( x \) pounds of strawberries, their cost for the strawberries is \( 20x \) dollars.

According to the problem, Sally, Jenny, and Moses paid $128 for their harvest after the entrance fee was deducted from the cost of the strawberries.

Therefore, the equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 20x - 12 = 128 \]

We need to solve for \( x \).

Let's solve the equation:

Let's denote the total number of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses as \( x \) pounds.

Each person pays an entrance fee of $4, so the total entrance fee for all three is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The strawberries are sold at a price of $20 per pound. Since they paid a total of $128, we can calculate the total number of pounds of strawberries they picked by dividing the total amount paid by the price per pound:
\[ \frac{128}{20} = 6.4 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the entrance fee is deducted from the cost of the harvest, we need to subtract the entrance fee from the total amount paid:
\[ 128 - 12 = 116 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we divide the remaining money by the price per pound to find out how many pounds of strawberries they picked:
\[ \frac{116}{20} = 5.8 \text{ pounds} \]

The total number of pounds picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses is the sum of the pounds picked without entrance fees and the pounds picked with entrance fees:

To find out how many pounds of strawberries Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked, we need to first establish how much each of them paid for their harvest. We know that the entrance fee is $4 per person and they paid a total of $128. 

1. First, subtract the entrance fee for all three people from the total payment:
   \[
   128 - (4 + 4 + 4) = 128 - 12 = 116
   \]
   This means the total cost of the strawberries before deducting the entrance fee was $116.

2. Since each pound of strawberries costs $20, we can find the number of pounds by dividing the total cost of the strawberries by the price per pound:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Miguel charges $4 per person to enter the strawberry fields.
2. Sally, Jenny, and Moses paid $128 for their harvest.
3. We need to find out how many pounds of strawberries they picked.

First, we need to determine the total entrance fee for all three people:

\[ \text{Total Entrance Fee} = \text{Number of Payers} \times \text{Entry Charge per Person} \]

\[ \text{Total Entrance Fee} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Next, we know that Miguel's generous man deducts this entrance fee from the total cost. Therefore, the total amount spent on strawberries after deducting the entrance fee is:

\[ \text{Total Cost after Entrance Fee} = \text{Total Cost Paid} - \text{Total Entrance Fee} \]

\[ \text{Total Cost after Entrance Fee} = 128 - 12 = 116 \]

Now, we use the standard price of strawberries, which is $20 per pound, to determine how many pounds of strawberries they picked:

\[ \text{Total Pounds of Strawberries} = \frac{\text{Total Cost after Entrance Fee}}{\text{Price Per Pound}} \]

\[ \text{Total Pounds of Strawberries} = \frac{116}{20} = 5.8 \]

Let's denote the number of pounds of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses as \( P \).

Given that Miguel charges $4 for each picker and the standard price of strawberries is $20 per pound, we can write the following equation for the cost of the harvest:

\[ (P - 3) \times 20 - 4 \times 3 = 128 \]

Here, \( P - 3 \) represents the number of pounds picked that are not charged by Miguel, and 3 represents the number of people (Sally, Jenny, and Moses). The minus sign is due to the fact that the entrance charge was deducted from the total harvest cost.

Now, let's solve for \( P \):

\[ 20P - 60 = 128 + 12 \]

Let's denote the total number of pounds of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses as \( N \).

Miguel charges \( \$4 \) for access to the strawberry fields, so the total cost for each person to pick strawberries before deductions is \( 4N \).

After paying the entrance fee, they picked the strawberries, and they paid \( \$128 \) in total. Since the standard price of a pound of strawberries is \( \$20 \), the total cost in dollars can also be expressed as \( 20N \).

Given that the total cost after deductions (after paying the entrance fee) is \( \$128 \), we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4N + 128 = 20N \]

We need to solve this equation for \( N \):

\[ 128 = 20N - 4N \]
\[ 128 = 16N \]
\[ N = \frac{128}{16} \]
\[ N = 8 \]

Given:
- Each person pays $4 for access to the fields.
- The cost of strawberries per pound is $20.
- The total cost Sally, Jenny, and Moses paid is $128.

First, calculate the total entrance charge for the three people:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 4 \text{ dollars/person} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know the total cost for the strawberries is the sum of the entrance fee and the cost of the strawberries:

To find \( x \), set up the equation:
\[ 12 + 20x = 128 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 20x = 116 \]

Now, divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{116}{20} \]
\[ x = 5.8 \]

Thus, Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked \( \boxed{5.8} \) pounds of strawberries.
