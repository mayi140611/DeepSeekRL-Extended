96
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote Anne's age as \( A \), Emile's age as \( E \), and Maude's age as \( M \).

From the problem, we know that when Anne is twice as old as Emile (\( A = 2E \)) and Emile is six times as old as Maude (\( E = 6M \)), Maude will be 8 years old (\( M = 8 \)).

First, we calculate Emile's age when Maude will be 8 years old:
\[ E = 6 \times M = 6 \times 8 = 48. \]

Next, we use the information that Anne will be twice as old as Emile:
\[ A = 2 \times E = 2 \times 48 = 96. \]

So, Anne will be 96 years old.

Let M be Maude's age, E is Emile's age, and A is Anne's age.

We know that M = 8.

We also know that A = 2E and E = 6M.

Substituting the value of M into the equation for E, we get E = 6*8 = 48.

Then substituting the value of E into the equation for A, we get A = 2*48 = 96.

Therefore, Anne will be 96 years old.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####

system
Let \(M\) be Emile's current age, \(A\) be Anne's current age, and \(E\) be Maude's current age. We know that Maude will be 8 years old, so \(E = 8\).

According to the problem, Emile will be six times as old as Maude at that time, so \(E + t = 6 \times E\), where \(t\) is the number of years from now until Maude is 8 years old. Since Maude is currently 8 years old and will be 8 in \(t\) years, we have:
\[ E + t = 6 \times E \]
\[ 8 + t = 6 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + t = 48 \]
\[ t = 40 \]

So Emile will be 40 years old when Maude is 8 years old. Now, Anne will be four times as old as Emile at that time, so \(A + 40 = 4 \times (E + 40)\). Since \(E = 8\), we have:
\[ A + 40 = 4 \times (8 + 40) \]
\[ A + 40 = 4 \times 48 \]
\[ A + 40 = 192 \]
\[ A = 152 \]

Therefore, Anne will be 152 years old when Emile is 40 years old.

Let's denote the current ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude as \(A\), \(E\), and \(M\) respectively.

We are given that:
1. \(E = 6M\)
2. \(M = 8\), so \(E = 6 \times 8 = 48\)
3. In 2 years, Anne will be twice as old as Emile. So, if Anne is \(A\) years old now, in 2 years she will be \(A + 2\) and in 2 years Emile will be \(E + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50\). At that time, \(A + 2 = 2 \times 50 = 100\).

So, \(A = 100 - 2 = 98\).

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the current ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude as \( A \), \( E \), and \( M \) respectively. According to the problem, if Maude will be 8 years old, then Emile will be six times as old as Maude at that time. So, we can write the equation:

\[ E = 6 \times M \]

Given that Maude will be 8 years old, we substitute \( M = 8 \) into the equation:

\[ E = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So, Emile will be 48 years old at that time. The problem also states that by the time Anne is two times as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude. This means that by the time Anne is two times as old as Emile, Emile will be 6 times 8, which is 48, just as we calculated above. Therefore, by that time Emile will be 48 years old.

Now, we need to determine Anne's age at that time. If Emile is 48 years old at that point, and Anne is two times as old as Emile, then:

\[ A = 2 \times 48 = 96 \]

So, Anne will be \boxed{96} years old at that time.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. If Maude will be 8 years old, then:
   Maude's age = Maude's age
   Maude's age = 8 years old

2. If Emile will be six times as old as Maude, then:
   Emile's age = 6 * Maude's age
   Emile's age = 6 * 8
   Emile's age = 48 years old

3. If Anne is two times as old as Emile, then:
   Anne's age = 2 * Emile's age
   Anne's age = 2 * 48
   Anne's age = 96 years old

So, Anne will be 96 years old when Emile is six times as old as Maude.

#### GENERATION 8 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the current ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude as A, E, and M respectively.

According to the given information, when Anne is two times as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude. So we can write:

A = 2E
E = 6M

We also know that Maude's future age will be 8 years:
M + X = 8

where X is the number of years from now.

Since Emile's age at that moment will be 6 times Maude's age at that moment:
E + X = 6M

Now, let's solve the equations step by step.

1) From the first equation, we get E = 2A / 2 = A. So Emile's age at that moment will be A.
2) From the second equation, we substitute E with A:
A + X = 6M

3) We know that M + X = 8, so X = 8 - M.

Substituting X in the second equation:
A + (8 - M) = 6M

Now we solve for A:
A + 8 = 7M
A = 7M - 8

We also know from Maude's future age equation:
M = 8 - X
M = 8 - (8 - M)
M = 8 - 8 + M
M = M

This simplifies to:
A = 7M - 8

Now, since Maude's age will be 8 years:
M = 8

Substituting M in the equation for A:
A = 7(8) - 8
A = 56 - 8
A = 48

So Anne will be 48 years old when Emile is six times as old as Maude.

Let's denote the current ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude as \( A \), \( E \), and \( M \) respectively.

According to the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( E = 2M \)
2. \( E = 6M \)

We are also given that Maude will be 8 years old in the future. So, we can denote the future age of Maude as \( M_{\text{future}} = 8 \).

Using the first equation from the problem, we can express the age of Anne in terms of Emile's age:
\[ A = 2E \]

We need to find the current age of Anne. First, let's express Emile's current age using the second equation from the problem:
\[ E = 6M \]

Since Maude will be 8 years old, we can substitute \( M = 8 \) into the equation \( E = 6M \):
\[ E = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

Now, we can substitute the value of \( E \) into the equation for Anne's age:
\[ A = 2E = 2 \times 48 = 96 \]

So, the current age of Anne is 96 years old.

Let's denote the current ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude as \( A \), \( E \), and \( M \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. By the time Anne is twice as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude.
2. If Maude is 8 years old, then Maude's age in the future is \( M + x \) where \( x \) is the number of years until the condition in the first statement is met.

First, let's express the current ages:
- Emile's current age \( E = M \)
- Anne's current age \( A \)
- Maude's current age \( M = 8 \)

According to the first statement:
- In \( x \) years, Emile's age will be \( E + x = M + x \)
- Anne's age will be \( A + x \)
- Emile's age will be six times Maude's age in the future, so \( E + x = 6(M + x) \)

Substitute \( E = M \) into the equation:
\[ M + x = 6(M + x) \]

Since \( M = 8 \), we substitute \( M \) with 8:
\[ 8 + x = 6(8 + x) \]
\[ 8 + x = 48 + 6x \]
\[ x - 6x = 48 - 8 \]
\[ -5x = 40 \]
\[ x = -8 \]

We made an error in the interpretation. Let's correct it:
\[ 8 + x = 6(8 + x) \]
\[ 8 + x = 48 + 6x \]
\[ x - 6x = 48 - 8 \]
\[ -5x = 40 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

This should be:
\[ 8 + x = 6(8 + x) \]
\[ 8 + x = 48 + 6x \]
\[ x - 6x = 48 - 8 \]
\[ -5x = 40 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

But let's recheck the interpretation:
\[ 8 + x = 6(8 + x) \]
\[ 8 + x = 48 + 6x \]
\[ x - 6x = 48 - 8 \]
\[ -5x = 40 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, in 8 years, Emile will be \( 8 + 8 = 16 \) years old, and Anne will be \( 16 + 8 = 24 \) years old.

Answer: Anne will be \(\boxed{24}\) years old.

Let's denote the current ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude as \( A \), \( E \), and \( M \) respectively.

From the problem statement, we know the following relationships:
1. Emile will be six times as old as Maude.
2. If Maude will be 8 years old, by the time Anne is two times as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude.

First, we express Maude's age and Emile's age in terms of Maude's age:
- Maude will be 8 years old.
- Therefore, Emile's age at that time will be \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) years.

Next, we need to determine Anne's age at that time. Let's denote the age difference between Anne and Emile by \( d \). Therefore, at that future time, Anne's age will be \( A + d \).

According to the problem, Anne will be two times as old as Emile at that point:
\[ A + d = 2 \times 48 \]
\[ A + d = 96 \]
\[ A = 96 - d \]

We also know that Emile's age will be 48 at that time:
\[ E = 48 \]

Since Emile's current age is \( E \), we can denote Emile's old age as \( E \times 6 \):
\[ E \times 6 = 48 \]
\[ E = \frac{48}{6} = 8 \]

So, Emile is currently 8 years old, and his old age will be \( 8 \times 6 = 48 \) years.

Now, we substitute \( E = 8 \) into the equation for the difference \( d \):
\[ 8 + d = 48 \]
\[ d = 48 - 8 = 40 \]

Therefore, Anne's current age is:
\[ A = 96 - 40 = 56 \]

So, Anne will be 56 years old when Emile will be 48 years old.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]

Let's denote the current ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude as A, E, and M, respectively.

According to the problem, when Anne is twice as old as Emile (i.e., in 2 years), Emile will be six times as old as Maude.

So, the statement can be translated into the following equation:

\[ A = 2E \]
\[ E + 2 = 6(M + 2) \]

We know that Maude will be 8 years old in the future, so Maude's current age is \( M = 8 - 2 = 6 \).

Substituting \( M = 6 \) into the second equation:

\[ E + 2 = 6 \cdot (6 + 2) \]
\[ E + 2 = 6 \cdot 8 \]
\[ E + 2 = 48 \]
\[ E = 44 \]

Now, using the first equation:

\[ A = 2 \cdot E \]
\[ A = 2 \cdot 44 \]
\[ A = 88 \]

So, Anne will be 88 years old when Emile is 44, and Emile will be six times as old as Maude, i.e., 6 * 8 = 48.

Let's denote Anne's age as \( A \), Emile's age as \( E \), and Maude's age as \( M \).

We are given the following conditions:

1. By the time Anne is two times as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude.
2. Maude will be 8 years old.

First, let's translate the conditions into mathematical equations:

From the second condition:
\[ M = 8 \]

From the first condition after Emile's age is compared:
\[ A = 2E \]

And:
\[ E = 6M \]

Now, we substitute \( M = 8 \) into \( E = 6M \):
\[ E = 6 \times 8 \]
\[ E = 48 \]

Then, we substitute \( E = 48 \) into \( A = 2E \):
\[ A = 2 \times 48 \]
\[ A = 96 \]

So, if Maude is 8 years old, Anne will be 96 years old.

1. By the time Anne is twice as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude.
2. Maude will be 8 years old.

Let's use \( M = 8 \) as given. We can express the ages of Anne and Emile in terms of Maude's age.

3. Let \( A \) be Anne's age when Emile is six times as old as Maude.
4. Let \( E \) be Emile's age when Emile is six times as old as Maude.

Since Maude is 8 years old, Emile will be six times as old as Maude, so Emile's age will be \( E = 6 \times 8 = 48 \) years old. At that time, Anne will be twice as old as Emile, so Anne's age will be \( A = 2 \times 48 = 96 \) years old.

So, when Emile is 48 years old, Anne will be 96 years old. Since this is when Emile is six times as old as Maude, Maude will also be older.

5. Therefore, Maude's age when Emile is 48 years old is Maude's age minus the number of years it takes for Emile to reach that age. Since Emile is 48 years old and Maude is 8 years old, the number of years is \( 48 - 8 = 40 \) years. So Maude's age will be \( 8 + 40 = 48 \) years old.

6. When Maude is 48 years old, the total number of years from now is not needed, as we are calculating Anne's current age, which is 96 years old.

7. Therefore, Anne will always be 96 years old.
