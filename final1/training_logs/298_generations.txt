system
Let's denote the total number of sweets initially on the table as \( x \).

1. According to the problem, Jack initially took half of all the candies plus 4 more. This is:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

2. After Jack took his sweets, the number of sweets left is:
\[ x - (\frac{x}{2} + 4) \]

3. Paul then took the remaining 7 sweets. So we now have:
\[ x - (\frac{x}{2} + 4) = 7 \]

4. Simplify the equation by finding a common denominator for the terms involving \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{2} - \frac{x}{2} + 4 - 4 = 7 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 7 \]

5. Multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the total number of sweets initially on the table was \( x = 14 \).

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's reason through this problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) represent the total number of sweets on the table initially.
2. Jack takes half of all the candies and 4 more candies. This means Jack took \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \) candies.
3. Paul then takes the remaining 7 sweets. This means \( x - (\frac{x}{2} + 4) = 7 \).

Now let's set up and solve this equation:

\[
x - \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) = 7
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[
2x - (x + 8) = 14
\]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[
2x - x - 8 = 14
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
x - 8 = 14
\]

Add 8 to both sides:

\[
x = 22
\]

So, there were 22 sweets on the table at first.

Let's denote the total number of sweets on the table initially as \( S \).

1. According to the problem, Jack took half of all the candies plus 4 more candies.
   This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{S}{2} + 4
   \]

2. After Jack took his share, the remaining sweets are:
   \[
   S - \left(\frac{S}{2} + 4\right)
   \]

3. Paul took the remaining 7 sweets:
   \[
   S - \left(\frac{S}{2} + 4\right) = 7
   \]

4. We set up the equation and solve for \( S \):
   \[
   S - \left(\frac{S}{2} + 4\right) = 7
   \]
   Simplifying inside the parentheses and solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S - \frac{S}{2} - 4 = 7
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   \frac{S}{2} = 7 + 4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{S}{2} = 11
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 22
   \]

5. To verify, if we had 22 sweets initially, Jack would have taken half of 22 and 4 more:
   \[
   \frac{22}{2} + 4 = 11 + 4 = 15
   \]
   Thus, 7 sweets would remain, which matches the statement.

Therefore, the total number of sweets on the table initially was \( \boxed{22} \).

Let's denote the total number of sweets initially on the table as \( x \).

1. Jack took half of all the sweets plus 4 more sweets. This can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} + 4
   \]

2. After Jack took his share, the remaining sweets were 7. So, the equation for the remaining sweets after Jack took his share is:
   \[
   x - \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) = 7
   \]

3. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{2} - 4 = 7
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} - 4 = 7
   \]
   \[

Let's denote the initial number of sweets on the table as \( x \).

Jack took half of the sweets and 4 more, so we can write the equation regarding what he took as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \text{amount Jack took} \]

After Jack took his share, Paul came along and took the remaining sweets, which is given as 7. So we can write another equation based on what Paul took:
\[ x - (\text{amount Jack took}) = 7 \]

Now we use what we know about the candies Jack took:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 7 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 7 - 4 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Now we need to multiply both sides by 2:
\[ x = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, there were initially 6 sweets on the table.

Let's denote the original number of sweets as \( x \).

2. After Jack took his share, there were \( x - (\frac{x}{2} + 4) = \frac{x}{2} - 4 \) sweets left.
3. Paul then took the remaining 7 sweets, which means \( \frac{x}{2} - 4 = 7 \).

We can solve for \( x \):

4. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x - \left(\frac{x}{2} + 4\right) = 7 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

\[ \begin{align*}
x - \left(\frac{x}{2} + 4\right) &= 7 \\
x - \frac{x}{2} - 4 &= 7 \\
x - \frac{x}{2} - 4 + 4 &= 7 + 4 \\

Paul then took the remaining sweets, which we know was 7. So we can write:

Now we need to solve this equation for \( x \). Let's subtract \(\frac{x}{2}\) from both sides:

Combining like terms, we get:

Adding 7 to both sides:
