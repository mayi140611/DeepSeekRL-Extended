Let's denote the number of parrots as \( P \), snakes as \( S \), and monkeys as \( M \). The number of elephants as \( E \), and the number of zebras as \( Z \).

From the problem, we have:
1. The number of parrots \( P = 8 \).
2. The number of snakes \( S \) is 3 times the number of parrots, so \( S = 3 \times 8 = 24 \).
3. The number of monkeys \( M \) is 2 times the number of snakes, so \( M = 2 \times 24 = 48 \).
4. The number of elephants \( E \) is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, so \( E = \frac{P + S}{2} = \frac{8 + 24}{2} = 16 \).
5. The number of zebras \( Z \) is 3 fewer than the elephants, so \( Z = E - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \).

Now we need to find the difference between the number of zebras and the number of monkeys:
\[ \text{Difference} = M - Z = 48 - 13 = 35 \]

So the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 35.

The zoo has 8 parrots. The number of snakes is three times the number of parrots, which means it has \(3 \times 8 = 24\) snakes. The number of monkeys is twice the number of snakes, which means it has \(2 \times 24 = 48\) monkeys.

The number of elephants is half the sum of parrots and snakes, which means it has \(\frac{8 + 24}{2} = 16\) elephants.

The number of zebras is 3 less than the number of elephants, which means it has \(16 - 3 = 13\) zebras.

Now we need to find the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys:
\[ \text{Number of zebras} - \text{Number of monkeys} = 13 - 48 = -35 \]

The difference is -35, which indicates that there are 35 more zebras than monkeys.

To determine the number of each animal, we start by identifying the number of parrots:
Given that there are 8 parrots.

The number of snakes is three times the number of parrots, so:
\[ \text{Number of snakes} = 3 \times \text{Number of parrots} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

The number of monkeys is twice the number of snakes, so:
\[ \text{Number of monkeys} = 2 \times \text{Number of snakes} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

The number of elephants is half the sum of the number of parrots and snakes:
\[ \text{Number of elephants} = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Number of parrots} + \text{Number of snakes}) = \frac{1}{2} (8 + 24) = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \]

Finally, there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants:
\[ \text{Number of zebras} = \text{Number of elephants} - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

To find the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys, we subtract the number of zebras from the number of monkeys:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of monkeys} - \text{Number of zebras} = 48 - 13 = 35 \]

Therefore, the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 35.

To find the difference in number between zebras and monkeys, we need to first calculate the number of each animal based on the information given.

1. Number of parrots = 8.
2. Number of snakes = 3 times the number of parrots = 3 * 8 = 24.
3. Number of monkeys = 2 times the number of snakes = 2 * 24 = 48.
4. Number of elephants = half the number of parrots and snakes = (8 + 24) / 2 = 32.
5. Number of zebras = 3 fewer than elephants = 32 - 3 = 29.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of zebras and monkeys:
29 (zebras) - 48 (monkeys) = -19.

Since we are asked for the absolute difference, we take the absolute value:
|-19| = 19.

Therefore, the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 19.

Let's denote:
- \( P \) as the number of parrots,
- \( S \) as the number of snakes,
- \( M \) as the number of monkeys,
- \( E \) as the number of elephants,
- \( Z \) as the number of zebras.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( P = 8 \)
2. \( S = 3P \)
3. \( M = 2S \)
4. \( E = \frac{P + S}{2} \)
5. \( Z = E - 3 \)

Substituting \( P \) and \( S \) in terms of \( E \):
- \( S = 3P = 3 \times 8 = 24 \)
- \( E = \frac{P + S}{2} = \frac{8 + 24}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
- \( Z = E - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \)

Now, we need to find the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys:
- \( M = 2S = 2 \times 24 = 48 \)
- The difference between the zebras and the monkeys is \( M - Z = 48 - 13 = 35 \)

Let's define the variables for the number of each animal:
- Let \( P \) be the number of parrots.
- Let \( S \) be the number of snakes.
- Let \( M \) be the number of monkeys.
- Let \( E \) be the number of elephants.
- Let \( Z \) be the number of zebras.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( P = 8 \)
2. The number of snakes \( S \) is 3 times the number of parrots: \( S = 3P \)
3. The number of monkeys \( M \) is 2 times the number of snakes: \( M = 2S \)
4. The number of elephants \( E \) is half the number of parrots and snakes added up: \( E = \frac{P + S}{2} \)
5. There are 3 fewer zebras than elephants: \( Z = E - 3 \)

First, substitute the known value of \( P \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, use \( S \) to find \( M \):
\[ M = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Now, use \( M \) and \( S \) to find \( E \):
\[ E = \frac{P + S}{2} = \frac{8 + 24}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

Finally, use \( E \) to find \( Z \):
\[ Z = E - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

The number of zebras \( Z \) is 13. 

The difference in number between zebras and monkeys is:
\[ M - Z = 48 - 13 = 35 \]

Let's denote the number of parrots, snakes, and monkeys as \( p = 8 \), \( s \), and \( m \) respectively. 

According to the information given:
- There are 3 times the number of snakes than parrots: \( s = 3 \times p = 3 \times 8 = 24 \)
- There are 2 times the number of monkeys than snakes: \( m = 2 \times s = 2 \times 24 = 48 \)

Next, let's calculate the total number of elephants and zebras:

- There are 3 fewer zebras than elephants: \( z = e - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \)

Let's denote the number of snakes as S, the number of monkeys as M, the number of elephants as E, and the number of zebras as Z. We can then form the following equations based on the given information:

1. The number of parrots is 8.
   \[ \text{Parrots (P)} = 8 \]

2. The number of snakes is 3 times the number of parrots.
   \[ \text{Snakes (S)} = 3 \times \text{Parrots} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

3. The number of monkeys is 2 times the number of snakes.
   \[ \text{Monkeys (M)} = 2 \times \text{Snakes} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

4. The number of elephants is half the sum of the number of parrots and snakes.
   \[ \text{Elephants (E)} = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Parrots} + \text{Snakes}) = \frac{1}{2} (8 + 24) = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \]

5. The number of zebras is 3 fewer than elephants.
   \[ \text{Zebras (Z)} = \text{Elephants} - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of zebras and monkeys:
   \[ \text{Difference (Z - M)} = 13 - 48 = -35 \]

Since we are looking for the absolute difference, we take the absolute value:

To find the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys, let's first determine the number of each animal in the zoo.

Let \( P \) represent the number of parrots, \( S \) represent the number of snakes, and \( M \) represent the number of monkeys.

Given:
- \( P = 8 \) (Parrots are already given).
- \( S = 3P \) (The number of snakes is 3 times the number of parrots).
- \( M = 2S \) (The number of monkeys is 2 times the number of snakes).

First, we calculate:
\[ S = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]
\[ M = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of parrots and snakes combined:
\[ P + S = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

The number of elephants is half the sum of parrots and snakes:
\[ E = \frac{P + S}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

There are 3 fewer zebras than elephants:
\[ Z = E - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

To determine the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys, we calculate:
\[ \text{Difference} = M - Z \]
\[ M - Z = 48 - 13 = 35 \]

Therefore, the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 35.
