###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Sam, Sid, and Steve brought popsicle sticks for their group activity in their Art class. Sam has thrice as many as Sid, and Sid has twice as many as Steve. If Steve has 12 popsicle sticks, how many popsicle sticks can they use for their Art class activity?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of popsicle sticks Steve has as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 12 \).

Sid has twice as many popsicle sticks as Steve, so Sid has \( 2S \).

Sam has thrice as many popsicle sticks as Sid, so Sam has \( 3 \times 2S = 6S \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks they have:
\[
\text{Total} = S + 2S + 6S = 9S
\]
Since \( S = 12 \), we substitute this value to find the total:
\[
\text{Total} = 9 \times 12 = 108
\]

Therefore, they can use 108 popsicle sticks for their Art class activity.

Let's denote the number of popsicle sticks Steve has as \( S \), Sid as \( S \), and Sam as \( S \). According to the problem, Steve has 12 popsicle sticks, so \( S = 12 \).

Sid has twice as many as Steve, so Sid has \( 2S \). Since \( S = 12 \), Sid has \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) popsicle sticks.

Sam has thrice as many as Sid, so Sam has \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) popsicle sticks.

To find the total number of popsicle sticks they can use, we add the number of popsicle sticks each person has:

\[ S + S + S = 12 + 24 + 72 = 108 \]

So, they can use 108 popsicle sticks for their Art class activity.

To determine the total number of popsicle sticks that Sam, Sid, and Steve have, we first need to determine the number of popsicle sticks each of them has based on the information given:

- Steve has 12 popsicle sticks.
- Sid has twice as many as Steve, so Sid has \(2 \times 12 = 24\) popsicle sticks.
- Sam has thrice as many as Sid, so Sam has \(3 \times 24 = 72\) popsicle sticks.

Now, we can find the total number of popsicle sticks by adding the number of popsicle sticks each person has:

- Steve: 12 popsicle sticks
- Sid: 24 popsicle sticks
- Sam: 72 popsicle sticks

Total number of popsicle sticks = \(12 + 24 + 72 = 108\)

Therefore, they can use 108 popsicle sticks for their Art class activity.

Let's denote the number of popsicle sticks Sid has as \( S \). According to the problem, Sid has twice as many popsicle sticks as Steve, and Steve has 12 popsicle sticks. Therefore, Sid has:
\[ S = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ popsicle sticks} \]

Sam has thrice as many popsicle sticks as Sid. Since Sid has 24 popsicle sticks, Sam has:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ popsicle sticks} \]

To find the total number of popsicle sticks that Sam, Sid, and Steve have together, we sum these amounts:
\[ 72 + 24 + 12 = 108 \text{ popsicle sticks} \]

Thus, they can use 108 popsicle sticks for their art class activity.

Let's denote the number of popsicle sticks Steve has as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 12 \).

Sid has twice as many popsicle sticks as Steve, so Sid has \( 2S \). Substituting \( S = 12 \) into Sid's popsicle sticks, we get \( 2S = 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

Sam has thrice as many popsicle sticks as Sid. So, Sam has \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) popsicle sticks.

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks they have together:

- Steve has 12 popsicle sticks.
- Sid has 24 popsicle sticks.
- Sam has 72 popsicle sticks.

Adding these numbers together:

\( 12 + 24 + 72 = 108 \)

Therefore, they can use 108 popsicle sticks for their Art class activity.

Let's denote the number of popsicle sticks Steve has as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 12 \).

Sid has twice as many popsicle sticks as Steve, so the number of popsicle sticks Sid has is \( 2S \). Substituting \( S = 12 \), we get:
\[ 2S = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Sam has thrice as many popsicle sticks as Sid, so the number of popsicle sticks Sam has is \( 3 \times 24 \). Substituting the value of Sid's popsicle sticks, we get:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \]

To find the total number of popsicle sticks they can use for their Art class activity, we sum the number of popsicle sticks each of them has:
\[ S + 2S + 3S = 12 + 24 + 72 = 108 \]

Therefore, they can use 108 popsicle sticks for their Art class activity.
