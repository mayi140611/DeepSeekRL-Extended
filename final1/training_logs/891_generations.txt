To determine how many gallons of paint Henrietta needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total square footage of walls in the living room and the bedrooms:
   - Living room walls: 600 square feet
   - Each bedroom: 400 square feet
   - Number of bedrooms: 3
   - Total square footage of bedroom walls: 400 square feet/bedroom * 3 bedrooms = 1200 square feet
   - Total square footage of walls in the living room and bedrooms: 600 square feet + 1200 square feet = 1800 square feet

2. Calculate how many gallons of paint are needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 600 square feet
   - Total square footage of walls: 1800 square feet
   - Number of gallons needed: 1800 square feet / 600 square feet/gallon = 3 gallons

Therefore, Henrietta needs 3 gallons of paint.

First, we need to calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted. Henrietta has walls in three bedrooms, each taking 400 square feet. So, the total square footage for the bedrooms is:
\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

In the living room, Henrietta is painting walls that take up 600 square feet.

Therefore, the total square footage to be painted is:
\[ 1200 \text{ (bedrooms)} + 600 \text{ (living room)} = 1800 \text{ square feet} \]

Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons needed:
\[ \text{Gallons needed} = \frac{1800}{600} = 3 \]

Thus, Henrietta needs 3 gallons of paint.

First, let's calculate the total square footage of the walls in the bedrooms. Each bedroom has walls that take up 400 square feet, and Henrietta has three bedrooms, so:
\[ 400 \text{ square feet/bedroom} \times 3 \text{ bedrooms} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The walls in the living room take up 600 square feet. So, the total square footage of the walls Henrietta needs to paint is:
\[ 600 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} = 1800 \text{ square feet} \]

Since one gallon of paint can cover 600 square feet, we can find the number of gallons needed by dividing the total square footage by the coverage of one gallon:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ square feet}}{600 \text{ square feet/gallon}} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Henrietta needs 3 gallons of paint to paint her house.

To determine how many gallons of paint Henrietta needs, we first need to calculate the total square footage of the walls she needs to paint.

The living room walls take up 600 square feet.

Each bedroom has 400 square feet of walls, and since there are three bedrooms, the total for the bedrooms is:

Adding the living room and the bedrooms together, the total square footage to be painted is:

Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, we can find out how many gallons are needed by dividing the total square footage by the coverage per gallon:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ square feet}}{600 \text{ square feet/gallon}} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

To determine how many gallons of paint Henrietta needs, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that require painting. 

The living room has walls that take up 600 square feet. There are three bedrooms, and each bedroom's walls take up 400 square feet. Therefore, the total area for the bedrooms is:
\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the area of the living room walls and the bedrooms, we get:
\[ 600 + 1200 = 1800 \text{ square feet} \]

Each gallon of paint covers 600 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon:

To determine how many gallons of paint Henrietta needs, we first need to calculate the total square footage of all the walls in her house. 

The living room walls have a total area of 600 square feet.
Each of the three bedrooms has walls that cover 400 square feet each, so for all three bedrooms, the total area is \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) square feet.

Adding the living room and bedroom wall areas together gives the total wall area:
\[ 600 + 1200 = 1800 \text{ square feet} \]

Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, we divide the total wall area by the coverage per gallon to find out how many gallons are needed:
\[ \frac{1800}{600} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Henrietta needs 3 gallons of paint to cover all the walls in her house.

To determine how many gallons of paint Henrietta needs, we first calculate the total area that needs to be painted. This includes:

2. Walls in the first bedroom: 400 square feet
3. Walls in the second bedroom: 400 square feet
4. Walls in the third bedroom: 400 square feet

Adding these areas together gives us the total area to be painted:
\[ 600 \text{ square feet (living room)} + 400 \text{ square feet (first bedroom)} + 400 \text{ square feet (second bedroom)} + 400 \text{ square feet (third bedroom)} = 1800 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know that one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ square feet}}{600 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Henrietta's house has a total of 1 bedroom wall area + 2 bedroom wall area = 600 + 2 * 400 = 1000 square feet. If one gallon of paint can cover 600 square feet, then Henrietta will need a total of 1000 / 600 = 1.67 gallons to paint her house. Since she can't buy a fraction of a gallon, she will need to round up to 2 gallons.
