Buddy starts with 30 baseball cards on Monday. On Tuesday, he loses half of them, so he has \(30/2 = 15\) cards left. On Wednesday, he buys 12 cards, so he has \(15 + 12 = 27\) cards. On Thursday, he buys a third of what he had on Tuesday, which is \(15/3 = 5\) cards. Adding these to his previous total gives him \(27 + 5 = 32\) cards on Thursday.

Buddy starts with 30 baseball cards on Monday.

On Tuesday, he loses half of them, so he has \(30 / 2 = 15\) cards left.

On Wednesday, he buys 12 more cards, bringing his total to \(15 + 12 = 27\) cards.

On Thursday, he buys a third of what he had on Tuesday, which is \(15 / 3 = 5\) cards. So, he adds these to his existing cards, making his total \(27 + 5 = 32\) cards on Thursday.

Buddy starts with 30 baseball cards on Monday.

On Tuesday, he loses half of them. Half of 30 is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) baseball cards. So, he has \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) baseball cards left.

On Wednesday, he buys 12 baseball cards. Adding these to the 15 he has left, he now has \( 15 + 12 = 27 \) baseball cards.

On Thursday, he buys a third of what he had on Tuesday. A third of 15 is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) baseball cards. So, he adds 5 to his current total of 27 baseball cards, giving him \( 27 + 5 = 32 \) baseball cards on Thursday.
