To find out how many more tiles are needed to complete the pool, we'll subtract the number of tiles already present from the total number of tiles required.

Total number of tiles needed = 100
Number of blue tiles available = 48
Number of red tiles available = 32

First, let's add the number of blue and red tiles available:
48 (blue tiles) + 32 (red tiles) = 80 tiles

Now, subtract the number of tiles available from the total number needed:
100 (total tiles needed) - 80 (available tiles) = 20 tiles

Therefore, 20 more tiles are needed to complete the pool.

First, we need to find the total number of tiles already in the pool. The pool has 48 blue tiles and 32 red tiles, so the total number of tiles currently in the pool is:

\[ 48 + 32 = 80 \]

The pool needs a total of 100 tiles to be completed. To find out how many more tiles are needed, we subtract the number of tiles already in the pool from the total number of tiles required:

\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \]

So, the pool needs 20 more tiles to be completed.

To find out how many more tiles are needed to complete the pool, we first need to add up the total number of tiles already present:

- Blue tiles: 48
- Red tiles: 32

Total number of tiles already in the pool:
\[ 48 + 32 = 80 \]

Now, to find out how many more tiles are needed to reach 100:

\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \]

So, 20 more tiles are needed to complete the pool.

To find out how many more tiles are needed, we first need to determine the total number of tiles currently in the pool. We do this by adding the number of blue tiles to the number of red tiles:

\[ 48 \text{ blue tiles} + 32 \text{ red tiles} = 80 \text{ tiles} \]

Next, we find out how many more tiles are needed by subtracting the total number of tiles currently in the pool from the total number of tiles required to complete the pool:

\[ 100 \text{ tiles needed} - 80 \text{ tiles currently} = 20 \text{ tiles needed} \]

Therefore, 20 more tiles are needed to complete the pool.

To find out how many more tiles are needed, we first need to add the number of tiles the pool already has to the number of tiles it still needs. The pool has 48 blue tiles and 32 red tiles, and it still needs 100 tiles. So, the total number of tiles needed is 48 + 32 + 100.

$$ \text{Total tiles} = 48 + 32 + 100 $$

Now we calculate the sum:

$$ \text{Total tiles} = 80 + 100 = 180 $$

The pool already has 80 tiles (48 blue + 32 red), so we subtract this number from the total number of needed tiles to find out how many more tiles are needed.

$$ \text{Tiles needed} = 180 - 80 $$

Now we calculate this subtraction:

$$ \text{Tiles needed} = 100 $$

Therefore, 100 more tiles are needed.

To find out how many more tiles are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of tiles already in the pool. We do this by adding the number of blue tiles to the number of red tiles:

\[ \text{Total number of tiles} = \text{Number of blue tiles} + \text{Number of red tiles} \]
\[ \text{Total number of tiles} = 48 + 32 \]
\[ \text{Total number of tiles} = 80 \]

Now we know that the pool already has 80 tiles. If the pool needs a total of 100 tiles, we can find out how many more tiles are needed by subtracting the number of tiles already in the pool from the total number of tiles required:

\[ \text{Number of additional tiles needed} = \text{Total number of tiles required} - \text{Number of tiles in the pool} \]
\[ \text{Number of additional tiles needed} = 100 - 80 \]
\[ \text{Number of additional tiles needed} = 20 \]

So, 20 more tiles are needed to complete the pool.

To determine how many more tiles are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of tiles currently in the pool. The pool contains 48 blue tiles and 32 red tiles. Adding these together gives:

\[ 48 + 32 = 80 \]

The pool is currently at 80 tiles. Since it needs 100 tiles to be completed, we need to find out how many more tiles are required by subtracting the number of tiles already in the pool from the total number of tiles needed:

\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \]

Therefore, 20 more tiles are needed.
