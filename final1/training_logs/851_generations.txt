system
<reasoning>
To determine how much money Noemi began with, we need to calculate her total losses and then add that to the amount she still had. 

Noemi lost $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack. Therefore, her total losses are:
\[ 400 + 500 = 900 \]

After her losses, she still has $800 in her purse. So, the total amount of money she began with is:
\[ 800 + 900 = 1700 \]

Therefore, Noemi began with $1700.

Let's calculate the total amount of money Noemi lost:

- Lost on roulette: $400
- Lost on blackjack: $500

Total lost: $400 + $500 = $900

Noemi had $800 left, so to determine how much she had initially, we add the total lost amount to the amount she still had:

$900 (total lost) + $800 (what she had left) = $1,700

So, Noemi began with $1,700.

Noemi lost a total of $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack, which amounts to $400 + $500 = $900 in total loss. If she still had $800 in her purse, then she must have begun with $900 + $800 = $1700. 

So, Noemi began with $1700.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Noemi had as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Noemi lost $400 on roulette.
2. Noemi lost $500 on blackjack.
3. After these losses, she still had $800 left.

We can set up the equation to represent the total sum:
\[ x - 400 - 500 = 800 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x - 900 = 800 \]
\[ x = 800 + 900 \]
\[ x = 1700 \]

So, Noemi began with $1700.

To determine how much money Noemi began with, we need to account for all the transactions she made. Noemi lost $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack, which totals $900. She still has $800 left in her purse. Therefore, the amount of money she began with is the sum of the money lost and the money she still has, which is $900 + $800 = $1700.

<reasoning>
Let \( x \) be the amount of money Noemi began with. According to the problem, she lost $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack, and still had $800 in her purse. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x - 400 - 500 = 800 \]

We need to solve for \( x \).

First, combine the constants:
\[ x - 900 = 800 \]

Next, add 900 to both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 800 + 900 \]
\[ x = 1700 \]

So, Noemi began with $1700.

Noemi lost a total of $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack, which adds up to $400 + $500 = $900 in total loss. If she ended up with $800 after all her losses, she must have begun with $800 + $900 = $1700.

Thus, Noemi began with $1700.

To determine how much money Noemi began with, we need to consider the total amount she lost and the amount she still had in her purse.

1. Noemi lost $400 on roulette.
2. Noemi lost an additional $500 on blackjack.
3. Noemi still had $800 in her purse.

First, calculate the total amount lost:
\[
\text{Total lost} = \$400 + \$500 = \$900
\]

Noemi ended up with $800 after losing $900. Therefore, the amount of money she began with is:
\[
\text{Initial amount} = \text{Total lost} + \text{Amount left} = \$900 + \$800 = \$1700
\]

So, Noemi began with $1700.

To determine how much money Noemi began with, we need to add up all the amounts she actually had after her losses.

Here is the breakdown:
- Amount lost on roulette: $400
- Amount lost on blackjack: $500
- Amount remaining in purse: $800

To find the total amount Noemi had before these losses, we add the amount remaining to the total of the losses:
$400 (roulette) + $500 (blackjack) + $800 (remaining) = $1700

Therefore, Noemi began with $1700.

To determine how much money Noemi began with, we need to account for all the money she lost and the amount she still had.

Noemi lost $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack. This totals to \$400 + \$500 = \$900 in total losses.

She still had $800 in her purse, which represents the money she had before losing any.

To find out how much money she began with, we add the total losses to the money she still had.
\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Money still had} + \text{Total losses}
\]
\[
\text{Total money} = \$800 + \$900 = \$1700

Thus, Noemi began with $1700.

Let's denote the amount of money Noemi began with as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- She lost $400 on roulette.
- She lost $500 on blackjack.
- She still has $800 in her purse.

So, the total amount of money she had initially minus the amount she lost equals the amount she still has:
\[ x - 400 - 500 = 800 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x - 900 = 800 \]
\[ x = 800 + 900 \]
\[ x = 1700 \]

Therefore, Noemi began with $1700.
