Let's denote Jenny's original amount of money as \( x \).

According to the problem, after spending \( \frac{3}{7} \) of her money, she has $24 left. This means:
\[ x - \frac{3}{7}x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x \left(1 - \frac{3}{7}\right) = 24 \]
\[ x \left(\frac{7}{7} - \frac{3}{7}\right) = 24 \]
\[ x \left(\frac{4}{7}\right) = 24 \]

To isolate \( x \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{4}{7} \):
\[ x = 24 \times \frac{7}{4} \]
\[ x = 6 \times 7 \]
\[ x = 42 \]

So, Jenny's original amount of money is $42.

To find half of her original amount of money, we calculate:
\[ \frac{42}{2} = 21 \]

Thus, half of her original amount of money is $21.

Let's denote Jenny's original amount of money as \( M \).

Jenny spent \(\frac{3}{7}\) of her money, so she has \( 1 - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{4}{7} \) of her money left. This amount is equal to $24.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{4}{7} M = 24 \]

To find \( M \), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{7}{4}\):
\[ M = 24 \times \frac{7}{4} \]
\[ M = 24 \times 1.75 \]
\[ M = 42 \]

So, Jenny's original amount of money is $42.

To find half of her original amount, we divide her original amount by 2:
\[ \frac{42}{2} = 21 \]

Thus, half of Jenny's original amount of money is $21.

Let's denote Jenny's original amount of money as \( X \).

According to the problem, after spending \( \frac{3}{7} \) of her money, she has $24 left. This can be expressed as:
\[
X - \frac{3}{7}X = 24
\]

To simplify, we can factor out \( X \) on the left side of the equation:
\[
X \left( 1 - \frac{3}{7} \right) = 24
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\[
1 - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{7}{7} - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{4}{7}
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{4}{7}X = 24
\]

To solve for \( X \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{4}{7} \), which is \( \frac{7}{4} \):
\[
X = 24 \times \frac{7}{4}
\]

Performing the multiplication:
\[
X = 24 \times \frac{7}{4} = 6 \times 7 = 42
\]

Thus, Jenny's original amount of money is $42.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much Jenny originally had. If she spent 3/7 of her money and was left with $24, this $24 represents the 4/7 of her original amount because she hasn't spent anything, which means she would have been left with the 4/7 portion if she had spent the total. 

Let \( x \) be the original amount of money Jenny had. Then:
\[ \frac{4}{7}x = 24 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 \times \frac{7}{4} \]
\[ x = 18 \times 7 \]
\[ x = 126 \]

So, Jenny originally had $126.

Next, we need to find half of her original amount of money:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 126 = 63 \]

Therefore, half of her original amount of money is $63.

Jenny had $24 left after spending 3/7 of her money. This means she had $24 / (1 - 3/7) = $24 / (4/7) = $42 originally.

Half of her original amount of money is $42 / 2 = $21.

Let's denote Jenny's original amount of money as \( x \).

According to the information given, Jenny spent \( \frac{3}{7} \) of her money, and she had $24 left. So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{4}{7} x = 24 \]
This is because \( \frac{4}{7} \) of her original amount is what she had left, and this equals $24.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{24 \times 7}{4} = 42 \]

So, Jenny's original amount of money was $42.

Now, to find half of her original amount, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21 \]

Therefore, half of her original amount of money is $21.

Initially, Jenny had $24 left after spending \( \frac{3}{7} \) of her money. Let's denote her original amount of money by \( x \). Therefore, she spent \( \frac{3}{7}x \) and had \( 1 - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{4}{7} \) of her money left, which is equal to $24. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \frac{4}{7}x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we can solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{7}{4} \):
\[ x = 24 \times \frac{7}{4} = 42 \]

So, Jenny's original amount of money was $42. To find half of her original amount, we divide by 2:
\[ \frac{42}{2} = 21 \]

Thus, half of Jenny's original amount of money is $21.

Let's denote the original amount of money Jenny had as \( x \).

According to the problem, after spending \( \frac{3}{7} \) of her money, she had \( 24 \) dollars left. So we can write the equation:

\[ x - \frac{3}{7}x = 24 \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to combine the terms:

\[ \frac{4}{7}x = 24 \]

Now, to find \( x \), we divide both sides by \( \frac{4}{7} \) or multiply by its reciprocal, \( \frac{7}{4} \):

\[ x = 24 \times \frac{7}{4} \]

\[ x = 42 \]

So, Jenny originally had $42.

To find half of her original amount of money:

First, we need to determine how much money Jenny had initially by working backwards. If 3/7 of her money spent left her with $24, then the remaining fraction of her money, which is 1 - 3/7, represents the $24 amount. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{3}{7}} = \frac{7}{4} \text{ times the original amount} \]

Given that \(\frac{7}{4}\) times the original amount equals $24:

\[ 24 = \frac{7}{4} \times \text{Original amount} \]

To find the original amount, we solve for the original amount:

\[ \text{Original amount} = 24 \times \frac{4}{7} \]

Once we have the original amount, finding half of it is straightforward.

</reasoning>
<answer>
To find half of her original amount of money, we calculate:

\[ 24 \times \frac{4}{7} \]

\[ = \frac{96}{7} \]

\[ = \frac{96}{7} \times \frac{1}{2} \]

\[ = \frac{96}{14} \]

\[ = \frac{48}{7} \]

So, half of her original amount of money is \(\frac{48}{7}\).

</answer>
<Jenny spent \(\frac{3}{7}\) of her money. To find out how much she originally had, we can use the formula:

\[ 24 = \frac{4}{7} \times \text{Original amount} \]

Solving for the original amount:

\[ \text{Original amount} = 24 \times \frac{7}{4} = 42 \]

So the original amount of money Jenny had is $42. Half of this is:

\[ \frac{42}{2} = 21 \]

Therefore, half of Jenny's original amount of money is $21.

</Jenny spent \(\frac{3}{7}\) of her money. To find out how much she originally had, we can use the formula:

</Jenny's original amount = 24 * (7/4) = 42. So the original amount of money Jenny had is $42. Half of this is:

</Jenny's half amount = 42 / 2 = 21. Therefore, half of Jenny's original amount of money is $21.

Let's denote Jenny's original amount of money as \( X \).

Jenny spent \( \frac{3}{7} \) of her money, leaving her with \( 1 - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{4}{7} \) of her money.

We know that \( \frac{4}{7} \) of her money equals $24 (the amount left after spending). We can set up the equation to find the original amount 'X':

\[ \frac{4}{7}X = 24 \]

To find the value of X, we can solve the equation:

\[ X = 24 \times \frac{7}{4} \]

\[ X = 6 \times 7 \]

\[ X = 42 \]

So, the original amount of money Jenny had is $42.

Now, we need to find half of her original amount of money:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21 \]

Therefore, half of her original amount of money is $21.

To find out how much half of Jenny's original amount of money was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Jenny spent.
2. Use the amount spent to find the original amount of money.
3. Calculate half of the original amount.

Since Jenny had $24 left after spending 3/7 of her money, it means she spent 4/7 of her money. 

Let \( M \) be the original amount of money Jenny had. So, \( \frac{4}{7}M = 24 \).

To find \( M \), we can solve the equation:
\[ M = 24 \times \frac{7}{4} \]

Now, to find half of the original amount of money \( M \), we get:
\[ \frac{M}{2} \]

Let's calculate \( M \) first, then find \( \frac{M}{2} \).

To determine half of Jenny's original amount of money, we first need to find out how much money she had initially. We know that after spending \( \frac{3}{7} \) of her money, she had \( \frac{4}{7} \) of her money remaining. Let's denote her original amount of money as \( x \). According to the problem, \( \frac{4}{7} \) of \( x \) is equal to $24. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
