Each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account, so each account has $3,456 / 4 = $864.
The combined balance of both Gina's accounts is $864 + $864 = $1,728.

Each of Gina's accounts has half the balance of Betty's account, so the balance in each of Gina's accounts is $3,456 / 4 = $864. Since Gina has two accounts, the combined balance is $864 * 2 = $1,728.

Each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of the balance of Betty's account. Since Betty's account balance is $3,456, each of Gina's accounts has a balance of \( \frac{1}{4} \times 3456 = 864 \). Therefore, the combined balance of both of Gina's accounts is \( 864 + 864 = 1728 \).

Each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of Betty's account balance.

Betty's account balance is $3,456.

First, we find out how much one of Gina's accounts holds:
\[ \text{Gina's account balance} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3,456 \]

\[ \text{Gina's account balance} = 864 \]

Since there are two accounts, we calculate the total balance of both:
\[ \text{Total balance} = 864 + 864 = 1,728 \]

Therefore, the combined balance of both Gina's accounts is $1,728.

Each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account, so we calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Balance in one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3456 = 864 \]

Since Gina has two accounts, the combined balance for both is:

\[ \text{Combined balance} = 864 \times 2 = 1728 \]

To find the combined balance of both Gina's accounts, we first need to determine the balance in one of Gina's accounts. Since each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account, we calculate the balance in one of Gina's accounts as follows:

Balance in one of Gina's accounts = 1/4 * Betty's account balance
Balance in one of Gina's accounts = 1/4 * $3,456
Balance in one of Gina's accounts = $864

Since Gina has two accounts, the combined balance of both Gina's accounts is:

Combined balance of both Gina's accounts = 2 * Balance in one of Gina's accounts
Combined balance of both Gina's accounts = 2 * $864
Combined balance of both Gina's accounts = $1,728

<answer>
$1,728
</answer>
<reasoning>
Gina's balance in one account is a quarter of Betty's balance, so her balance in one account is $3,456 / 4 = $864. Since Gina has two accounts, her total balance is $864 * 2 = $1,728.

To find the balance of each of Gina's accounts, we first need to calculate a quarter of Betty's account balance. Since Betty's account balance is $3,456, each of Gina's accounts has an amount that is one quarter of $3,456. 

\[ \text{Balance per Gina's account} = \frac{3456}{4} \]

Now we calculate the exact amount:
\[ \frac{3456}{4} = 864 \]

So each of Gina's accounts has an initial balance of $864.

To find the combined balance of both Gina's accounts, we would add the balances of both accounts, which is:
\[ 864 + 864 = 1728 \]

Therefore, the combined balance of both Gina's accounts is $1,728.

Gina's account balance is a quarter of Betty's account balance.

Betty's account balance = $3,456

Gina's account balance = \(\frac{1}{4} \times \$3,456 = \$864\)

Since Gina has two accounts, the combined balance of both Gina's accounts is:

Combined balance = Gina's first account balance + Gina's second account balance

Combined balance = $864 + $864

Combined balance = $1,728

To find the balance in each of Gina's accounts, we start by noting that each account has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account. Betty's account balance is $3,456. 

\[ \text{Balance in one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3456 \]

\[ \text{Balance in one of Gina's accounts} = 864 \]

Since Gina has two accounts, we calculate the combined balance of both Gina's accounts by multiplying the balance in one of her accounts by 2.

\[ \text{Combined balance} = 2 \times 864 \]

\[ \text{Combined balance} = 1728 \]
