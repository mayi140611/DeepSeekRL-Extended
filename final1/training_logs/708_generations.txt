First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jimmy bought:

- Pens: 3 pens * $1 each = $3
- Notebooks: 4 notebooks * $3 each = $12
- Folders: 2 folders * $5 each = $10

Now, let's add these amounts together to get the total cost:

Total cost = $3 + $12 + $10 = $25

Jimmy paid with a $50 bill, so to find out how much change he will get back, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

Change = $50 - $25 = $25

Therefore, Jimmy will get back $25 in change.

To determine the total cost of Jimmy's items, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

The cost of pens is calculated as:
\[ \text{Cost of pens} = 3 \text{ pens} \times \$1 \text{ per pen} = \$3 \]

The cost of notebooks is calculated as:
\[ \text{Cost of notebooks} = 4 \text{ notebooks} \times \$3 \text{ per notebook} = \$12 \]

The cost of folders is calculated as:
\[ \text{Cost of folders} = 2 \text{ folders} \times \$5 \text{ per folder} = \$10 \]

The total cost of Jimmy's items is the sum of the costs of the pens, notebooks, and folders:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3 + \$12 + \$10 = \$25 \]

Jimmy paid with a $50 bill, so the change he will get back is:
\[ \text{Change} = \$50 - \$25 = \$25 \]

First, we calculate the total cost of the pens. Jimmy bought 3 pens at $1 each, so the cost of the pens is:
\[ 3 \times 1 = $3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Jimmy bought 4 notebooks at $3 each, so the cost of the notebooks is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = $12 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the folders. Jimmy bought 2 folders at $5 each, so the cost of the folders is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = $10 \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the items to find the total cost:
\[ 3 + 12 + 10 = $25 \]

Jimmy paid with a $50 bill, so the change he will get back is:
\[ 50 - 25 = $25 \]

Therefore, Jimmy will get back $25 in change.

Jimmy bought pens for $1 each, which totals 3 * $1 = $3.
He bought notebooks for $3 each, which totals 4 * $3 = $12.
He bought folders for $5 each, which totals 2 * $5 = $10.
The total cost of the items is $3 + $12 + $10 = $25.
He paid with a $50 bill, so his change will be $50 - $25 = $25.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and folders. 

The pens cost Jimmy \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars. 
The notebooks cost \(4 \times 3 = 12\) dollars.
The folders cost \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.

So the total cost is \(3 + 12 + 10 = 25\) dollars.

If Jimmy paid with a $50 bill, we need to subtract the total cost from $50 to find out the change he will get back.

Change = \(50 - 25 = 25\) dollars.

So, Jimmy will get $25 back.

To determine how much change Jimmy will receive, we first need to calculate the total amount he spent on each type of item and then sum these amounts up.

- Jimmy bought 3 pens for $1 each, so the total for the pens is \(3 \times 1 = \$3\).
- He bought 4 notebooks for $3 each, so the total for the notebooks is \(4 \times 3 = \$12\).
- He also bought 2 folders for $5 each, so the total for the folders is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).

The total amount spent is the sum of the costs of the pens, notebooks, and folders: \(3 + 12 + 10 = \$25\).

Jimmy paid with a $50 bill, so the change he will receive is \(50 - 25 = \$25\).

To calculate the total cost of the items Jimmy bought, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then add those amounts together.

For the pens: 3 pens * $1/pen = $3
For the notebooks: 4 notebooks * $3/notebook = $12
For the folders: 2 folders * $5/folder = $10

The total cost of all the items is $3 + $12 + $10 = $25.

Jimmy paid with a $50 bill, so to find the change he will get back, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $50 - $25 = $25.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the pens. Jimmy bought 3 pens for $1 each, so the total cost for the pens is 3 * $1 = $3.

Next, we'll compute the cost of the notebooks. There are 4 notebooks, each costing $3, so the total for notebooks is 4 * $3 = $12.

Now, let's consider the folders. He bought 2 folders, each costing $5, making the total for folders 2 * $5 = $10.

To find the total cost, we sum the individual prices: $3 (pens) + $12 (notebooks) + $10 (folders) = $25.

If Jimmy paid with a $50 bill, we subtract the total cost from the bill amount to find the change: $50 - $25 = $25.

Therefore, Jimmy will get $25 in change.

Next, calculate the total cost of the notebooks:
4 notebooks × $3/notebook = $12

Then, calculate the total cost of the folders:
2 folders × $5/folder = $10

Now, add up all the costs to find the total expenditure:
$3 (pens) + $12 (notebooks) + $10 (folders) = $25

Jimmy paid with a $50 bill, so to find the change he will get back, subtract the total expenditure from the amount he paid:
