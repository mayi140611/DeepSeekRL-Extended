To find out how many dollars Lee earned mowing lawns last week, we need to calculate two things. First, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from mowing the lawns and tips. Second, we need to add the tips to the earnings from mowing the lawns.

The total amount he earned from mowing the lawns is calculated by multiplying the number of lawns mowed by the amount he charged for each lawn. 

Total earnings from mowing the lawns = Number of lawns mowed × Amount charged per lawn = 16 × $33 = $528

Next, we need to add the tips to the earnings from mowing the lawns. Each of the three customers gave him a $10 tip.

Total tips = Number of customers × Amount of tip per customer = 3 × $10 = $30

Now, we add the total tips to the earnings from mowing the lawns to find out the total amount Lee earned last week.

Total earnings = Earnings from mowing the lawns + Total tips = $528 + $30 = $558

Therefore, Lee earned $558 mowing lawns last week.

To determine how many dollars Lee earned mowing lawns last week, we need to consider both his regular earnings from mowing lawns and the tips he received.

1. First, calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
   Lee earned $33 per lawn. Last week, he mowed 16 lawns.
   \[
   33 \times 16 = 528
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total earnings from the tips:
   Each of the three customers gave him a $10 tip. Therefore, the total tip earned is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

3. Add the earnings from mowing lawns and the tips to find the total earnings:
   \[
   528 + 30 = 558
   \]

So, Lee earned \(\boxed{558}\) dollars mowing lawns last week.

To calculate Lee's total earnings, we need to find the earnings from mowing the lawns and the tips from the customers.

First, we calculate the earnings from mowing the lawns. Since Lee mowed 16 lawns and charges $33 per lawn, the total earning from lawns is:
\[16 \text{ lawns} \times \$33/\text{lawn} = \$528\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from tips. Since three customers each gave him a $10 tip, the total tip earnings are:
\[3 \text{ customers} \times \$10/\text{customer} = \$30\]

Now, we add the earnings from mowing the lawns and the tips to find Lee's total earnings:
\[\$528 + \$30 = \$558\]

Therefore, Lee earned a total of $558 mowing lawns last week.

To find out how many dollars Lee earned mowing lawns last week, we need to calculate the earnings from mowing the lawns and the tips separately, then add them together.

The amount earned from mowing lawns is the number of lawns mowed multiplied by the charge per lawn:

\( 16 \text{ lawns} \times \$33 \text{ per lawn} = \$528 \)

The amount earned from tips is the number of customers who gave a tip multiplied by the value of each tip:

\( 3 \text{ customers} \times \$10 \text{ per tip} = \$30 \)

Now we add the amount earned from mowing lawns and the amount earned from tips:

\( \$528 \text{ (lawn mowing)} + \$30 \text{ (tips)} = \$558 \)

Therefore, Lee earned a total of $558 mowing lawns last week.

3. Calculate the total earnings:
   Add his regular earnings to the total tips.
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Total Tips} = 528 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 558 \text{ dollars}

To determine how much Lee earned mowing lawns last week, we need to consider both his earnings from mowing the lawns and the tips he received.

1. **Earnings from mowing lawns:**
   Each lawn mowed earns Lee $33. Last week, he mowed 16 lawns. Therefore, his earnings from mowing lawns alone are:
   \[
   16 \text{ lawns} \times \$33 \text{ per lawn} = 16 \times 33 = \$528
   \]

2. **Tips:**
   Each of the three customers gave Lee a $10 tip. Therefore, the total tips he received are:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times \$10 \text{ per customer} = 3 \times 10 = \$30
   \]

3. **Total earnings:**
   To find the total amount Lee earned last week, we add his earnings from mowing lawns and his tips:
   \[
   \$528 + \$30 = \$558

Thus, Lee earned a total of:
\[
