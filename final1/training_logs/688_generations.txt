To find Edric's hourly rate, we first need to calculate his total number of hours worked per month.

Edric works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week. Let's calculate his weekly hours:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 48 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply his weekly hours by 4 to get his monthly hours:

\[ 48 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 192 \text{ hours/month} \]

Now, to find his hourly rate, we divide his total monthly salary by the total number of hours he works in a month:

\[ \$576 \text{ monthly salary} \div 192 \text{ hours/month} = \$3 \text{ per hour} \]

So, Edric's hourly rate is $3.

To find Edric's hourly rate, we need to determine how many hours he works in a month and then divide his monthly salary by that number. 

First, let's calculate the number of days Edric works in a month:
\[ \text{Workdays per month} = 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Next, let's find out how many hours Edric works in a month:
\[ \text{Hours per month} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 24 \text{ days/month} = 192 \text{ hours/month} \]

Now, we can calculate his hourly rate:
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Monthly salary}}{\text{Hours per month}} = \frac{576}{192} \]

Finally, we perform the division:
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = 3 \]

Therefore, Edric's hourly rate is $3.

Edric's monthly salary is $576 and he works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week. To find his hourly rate, we first need to calculate the total number of hours he works in a month.

First, we calculate how many hours he works in a day:
\[8 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the number of days he works in a month:
\[6 \text{ days/week} \]

Since his working hours are consistent each week, we multiply the daily working hours by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming we are working for 4 weeks in a month, we get:
\[8 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 192 \text{ hours/month}\]

Now, to find Edric's hourly rate, we divide his monthly salary by the total number of hours he works in a month:
\[\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\$576}{192 \text{ hours/month}}\]

Let's perform the division:
\[\text{Hourly rate} = \$3 \per \text{hour}\]

So, Edric's hourly rate is \$3.

To find Edric's hourly rate, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month and then divide that by the total number of hours he worked.

First, let's calculate his total earnings for the month:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Monthly Salary} = \$576 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours he worked for the month:
\[ \text{Hours per Day} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Days per Week} = 6 \]
\[ \text{Weeks per Month} = 4 \] (Assuming an average month has around 4 weeks)
\[ \text{Total Hours per Week} = \text{Hours per Day} \times \text{Days per Week} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \]
\[ \text{Total Hours per Month} = \text{Total Hours per Week} \times \text{Weeks per Month} = 48 \times 4 = 192 \]

Now, we can calculate the hourly rate by dividing his total earnings by the total hours he worked:
\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Total Hours per Month}} = \frac{576}{192} = \$3 \]

Therefore, Edric's hourly rate is \( \$3 \).

To find Edric's hourly rate, we need to determine how many hours he works in a week and then divide his monthly salary by that number.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Edric works in a week:

- He works 8 hours a day.
- He works 6 days a week.

\[ \text{Weekly hours} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \]

\[ \text{Weekly hours} = 48 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we can calculate his hourly rate by dividing his monthly salary by the number of hours he works in a week.

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Monthly salary}}{\text{Weekly hours}} \]

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{576 \text{ dollars}}{48 \text{ hours}} \]

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Edric's hourly rate is $12.

To find Edric's hourly rate, we first need to calculate how many hours he works in a month. 

He works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, so in a week he works:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 48 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are typically 4 weeks in a month, in a month he works:
\[ 48 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 192 \text{ hours/month} \]

Edric's monthly salary is $576, and this is earned in 192 hours, so his hourly rate is:
\[ \frac{576 \text{ dollars}}{192 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

To find Edric's hourly rate, we need to calculate his total weekly earnings first and then divide by the total number of hours he works in a week.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:
Edric's monthly salary is $576, so his weekly salary is half of that.

\[ \text{Weekly Salary} = \frac{\text{Monthly Salary}}{2} = \frac{576}{2} = 288 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Edric works in a week:
He works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week.

\[ \text{Total Hours per Week} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \]

Now, we can calculate his hourly rate by dividing his weekly earnings by the total number of hours he works in a week.

\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Weekly Salary}}{\text{Total Hours per Week}} = \frac{288}{48} = 6 \]

Therefore, Edric's hourly rate is $6.

To find Edric's hourly rate, we need to calculate his total weekly earnings and divide that by the total number of hours he works in that week.

First, we know his monthly salary is $576. To find his weekly earnings, we divide his monthly salary by 4 (assuming a month has 4 weeks):

\[
\text{Weekly Salary} = \frac{\text{Monthly Salary}}{4} = \frac{576}{4} = 144
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Edric works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week:

\[
\text{Total Hours per Week} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 48 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we can calculate his hourly rate by dividing his weekly earnings by the total number of hours worked in a week:

\[
\text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Weekly Salary}}{\text{Total Hours per Week}} = \frac{144}{48} = 3
\]

Therefore, Edric's hourly rate is $3 per hour.

To calculate Edric's hourly rate, we first need to determine how many hours he works in total each month.

He works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, so each week he works:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 48 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are typically 4 weeks in a month, his monthly working hours are:
\[ 48 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 192 \text{ hours/month} \]

Now, given that his monthly salary is $576, we can calculate his hourly rate by dividing his total monthly salary by the total number of hours he works in a month:
\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{576 \text{ dollars}}{192 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

First, we determine the total number of hours Edric works in a month. Since he works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, we calculate the weekly hours by multiplying these two values:

\[ 8 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} = 48 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we find the total number of weeks in a month by assuming a month has 4 weeks:

\[ 48 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks/month} = 192 \, \text{hours/month} \]

Edric's monthly salary is $576, and since he works 192 hours in a month, we can calculate his hourly rate by dividing his monthly salary by the total number of hours worked:

\[ \frac{576 \, \text{dollars}}{192 \, \text{hours}} = 3 \, \text{dollars/hour} \]

To find Edric's hourly rate, we first need to determine the total number of hours he works in a month.

Given:
- He works 8 hours a day.
- He works 6 days a week.
- We need to find the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the number of hours in a week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 48 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we find out the total number of hours in a month assuming there are roughly 4 weeks in a month:
\[ 48 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 192 \text{ hours/month} \]

Now, we know Edric's monthly salary is $576. To find his hourly rate, we divide his total monthly salary by the total number of hours worked in a month:
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total monthly salary}}{\text{Total hours in a month}} \]

To find Edric's hourly rate, we need to determine his total monthly earnings from his salary and then divide that by the total number of hours he works in a month.

First, calculate the total number of hours Edric works in a month:
He works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, and there are typically 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of working days in a month is:
\[8 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 192 \text{ hours/month}\]

Next, we need to find out his total monthly earnings from his salary of $576. However, it seems there is a mistake in the concept of monthly salary because the salary amount is not enough to cover such a long period with 192 hours worked. Assuming the salary is intended to cover a shorter period, let's calculate the hourly rate if the salary is for a different period that covers 192 hours.

The hourly rate can be calculated as:
\[\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total salary}}{\text{Total hours worked}} = \frac{576}{192} = 3\]

So, Edric's hourly rate is $3.
