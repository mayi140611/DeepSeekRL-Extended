###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Tanya went to the grocery store to buy some fruit.  She bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a small basket of plums, which were all placed in a single paper bag.  Unfortunately, the bag that the fruit had been placed in had developed a hole.  Therefore, as Tanya walked home, half of the fruit fell out of the bag.  When she later counted the fruit left in the bag, there were only 9 pieces remaining.  How many plums did she buy?

#### ANS ####

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let \( x \) be the number of plums Tanya bought. According to the problem, 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and the plums were originally in the bag, so the total number of fruits initially was \( 6 + 4 + 2 + x = 12 + x \).

When the bag developed a hole, half of the fruits fell out, so the number of fruits left in the bag was half of the initial number of fruits. This means that the number of fruits left in the bag is \( \frac{12 + x}{2} \).

According to the problem, the number of fruits left in the bag was 9, so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{12 + x}{2} = 9
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
12 + x = 18
\]

Next, we subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
x = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of plums Tanya bought is \( \boxed{6} \).

system
The total number of fruits initially bought is 6 pears + 4 Granny Smith apples + 2 pineapples + x plums = 12 + x. When half of the fruit fell out of the bag, the remaining 9 pieces of fruit means that half of the total fruit is equal to 9. To find the total number of fruits initially, we double this amount to get 9 * 2 = 18. So, the total number of fruits initially bought is 18, which means the number of plums she bought is 18 - 6 (pears) - 4 (granny smith apples) - 2 (pineapples) = 8 plums.

Let's denote the number of plums Tanya bought as \( P \).

First, we know the total number of fruits she initially bought:
\[ 6 \text{ pears} + 4 \text{ Granny Smith apples} + 2 \text{ pineapples} + P \text{ plums} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 12 + P \]

When the bag developed a hole, half of the fruit fell out. Therefore, the remaining half is 9 pieces:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times (12 + P) = 9 \]

To find the value of \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times (12 + P) = 9 \]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 12 + P = 18 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ P = 18 - 12 \]
\[ P = 6 \]

So, Tanya bought 6 plums.

Let's denote the number of plums by \( p \).

Tanya initially bought:
- 6 pears
- 4 Granny Smith apples
- 2 pineapples
- \( p \) plums

So, the total number of pieces of fruit initially is:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 + p = 12 + p \]

As Tanya walked home, half of the fruit fell out, so only half remained:
\[ \frac{12 + p}{2} = 9 \]

To find the total number of pieces of fruit initially, we can set up the equation:
\[ 12 + p = 18 \]

Now we can solve for \( p \):
\[ p = 18 - 12 \]
\[ p = 6 \]

Therefore, Tanya bought 6 plums.

system
Let's denote the number of plums Tanya bought as \( x \). The total number of fruits Tanya initially bought is \( 6 + 4 + 2 + x = 12 + x \). Since half of the fruit fell out of the bag, \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the fruits fell out, which means that \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the initial number of fruits remain. This is equal to 9 fruits. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2} (12 + x) = 9
\]

To find \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
12 + x = 18
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Tanya bought 6 plums.

system
Let's denote the total number of fruits that Tanya bought as \( T \). According to the information given, she bought 6 pears, 4 apples, 2 pineapples, and x plums. Thus, we can write:

\[ T = 6 + 4 + 2 + x \]

Since half of the fruit fell out of the bag, there are 9 pieces remaining, which means the remaining \( \frac{T}{2} \) is 9. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{T}{2} = 9 \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( T \):

\[ T = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Since \( T \) is the total number of fruits that Tanya bought, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find \( x \) (the number of plums):

\[ 18 = 6 + 4 + 2 + x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 18 = 12 + x \]
\[ x = 18 - 12 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Tanya bought 6 plums.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's calculate the total number of fruit before any fell out of the bag.

Tanya bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a small basket of plums.

Total fruit = 6 (pears) + 4 (apples) + 2 (pineapples) + x (plums)

After half of the fruit fell out, there were 9 pieces remaining.

Since half of the fruit fell out, the remaining 9 pieces represent the other half of the initial total.

So, the equation to find the initial total number of fruit is:

Initial total = 2 * Remaining fruit
Initial total = 2 * 9
Initial total = 18

Now, we add up all the initial pieces of fruit:

6 (pears) + 4 (apples) + 2 (pineapples) + x (plums) = 18

6 + 4 + 2 + x = 18
12 + x = 18

Now, subtract 12 from both sides to solve for x:

x = 18 - 12
x = 6

Therefore, Tanya bought 6 plums.

Let's start by calculating the total number of fruit Tanya originally bought. She bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a small basket of plums. Adding these together, we get:
\[6 + 4 + 2 + \text{plums} = \text{total fruit}\]

Let's denote the number of plums she bought as \( p \). So, the total number of fruit is:
\[6 + 4 + 2 + p = 12 + p\]

Since half of the fruit fell out of the bag, Tanya was left with only 9 pieces of fruit. Therefore, the number of pieces of fruit that fell out is:
\[ \frac{12 + p}{2} \]

According to the problem, when Tanya counted the remaining fruit, there were 9 pieces. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{12 + p}{2} = 9 \]

To find \( p \), we solve the equation step by step. First, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 12 + p = 18 \]

Next, subtract 12 from both sides to isolate \( p \):
\[ p = 18 - 12 \]
\[ p = 6 \]

So, the number of plums Tanya bought is \(\boxed{6}\).

system
The total number of fruits Tanya bought is 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a small basket of plums, which we denote as \( P \).

Given that half of the fruit fell out, the number of fruits remaining would be half of the total number of fruits initially bought. Tanya had 9 pieces of fruit left, so:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (6 + 4 + 2 + P) = 9
\]

First, calculate the sum of the pears and apples:

\[
6 + 4 = 10
\]

Next, add in the pineapples:

\[
10 + 2 = 12
\]

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} (12 + P) = 9
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( P \):

\[
12 + P = 18
\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[
P = 6

Let's denote the total number of fruit Tanya bought as \( T \). The total number of fruit bought is the sum of the pears, Granny Smith apples, pineapples, and plums. Therefore, we have:
\[ T = 6 \text{ (pears)} + 4 \text{ (Granny Smith apples)} + 2 \text{ (pineapples)} + P \text{ (plums)} \]
where \( P \) is the number of plums.

When the bag fell open, half of the fruit fell out. This means that the number of fruit left in the bag was \( \frac{T}{2} \). According to the problem, this number is 9. Therefore, we have:

Tanya originally bought a total of 6 pears + 4 Granny Smith apples + 2 pineapples + the quantity of plums she bought.

Since half of the fruit fell out of the bag and she was left with 9 pieces, it means that the number of fruit that fell out is half the total number of fruit she initially bought.

If she was left with 9 pieces of fruit, then she originally had 9 * 2 = 18 pieces of fruit.

Now we can calculate the number of plums by subtracting the number of other fruits from the total number of fruit:

18 total fruit - 6 pears - 4 Granny Smith apples - 2 pineapples = 8 plums.
