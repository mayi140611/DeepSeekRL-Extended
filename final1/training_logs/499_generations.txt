system
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe caught the ball 23 times.
2. Derek caught the ball four less than double the number Joe caught. So Derek's catches amount to \(2 \times 23 - 4 = 46 - 4 = 42\) times.
3. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of what Derek did. So Tammy's catches amount to \( \frac{1}{3} \times 42 + 16 = 14 + 16 = 30 \) times.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe caught the ball 23 times.
2. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. This means Derek made \(2 \times 23 - 4\) catches.
3. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. This means Tammy made \(\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Derek's catches} + 16\) catches.

Let's calculate Derek's catches:
\[ \text{Derek's catches} = 2 \times 23 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Derek's catches} = 46 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Derek's catches} = 42 \]

Next, let's calculate Tammy's catches:
\[ \text{Tammy's catches} = \frac{1}{3} \times 42 + 16 \]
\[ \text{Tammy's catches} = 14 + 16 \]
\[ \text{Tammy's catches} = 30 \]

So, Tammy caught the ball 30 times.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe caught the ball 23 times.
2. Derek's catches are four less than double the catches Joe did. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Derek's catches} = 2 \times \text{Joe's catches} - 4 = 2 \times 23 - 4

system
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe caught the ball 23 times.
   - Joe's catches: \( J = 23 \)

2. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did.
   - To find Derek's catches, we first calculate double Joe's catches: \( 2J = 2 \times 23 = 46 \)
   - Then, we subtract 4 from this amount: \( D = 46 - 4 = 42 \)
   - Derek's catches: \( D = 42 \)

3. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did.
   - To find a third of Derek's catches: \( \frac{D}{3} = \frac{42}{3} = 14 \)
   - Then, we add 16 to this amount: \( T = 14 + 16 = 30 \)
   - Tammy's catches: \( T = 30 \)

Now, let's summarize the reasoning and answer:

The number of times Tammy caught the ball is \( 30 \).

Let's denote Joe's catches as \( J \), Derek's catches as \( D \), and Tammy's catches as \( T \).

Given:
1. Joe caught the ball 23 times: \( J = 23 \).

Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did:
\[ D = 2 \times J - 4 \]

<reasoning>
Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Joe caught the ball 23 times.

Next, we need to calculate how many times Derek caught the ball. According to the problem, Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Let's denote the number of times Joe caught the ball as \( x \). So, \( x = 23 \).

Derek's catches can be calculated as follows: 
\[ \text{Derek's catches} = 2x - 4 \]

Now, substitute \( x = 23 \):
\[ \text{Derek's catches} = 2 \times 23 - 4 = 46 - 4 = 42 \]

Next, we need to determine how many times Tammy caught the ball. The problem states that Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did.

Let's denote the number of times Tammy caught the ball as \( y \). According to the problem:
\[ y = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Derek's catches} + 16 \]

Now substitute \( \text{Derek's catches} = 42 \):
\[ y = \frac{1}{3} \times 42 + 16 \]
\[ y = 14 + 16 \]
\[ y = 30 \]

So, Tammy caught the ball 30 times.

To determine how many times Tammy caught the ball, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Derek's catches.
2. Use Derek's catches to find Tammy's catches.

Given:
- Joe caught the ball 23 times.
- Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did.

First, calculate double the catches Joe did:
\[ 2 \times 23 = 46 \]

Next, calculate four less than this result:
\[ 46 - 4 = 42 \]

So, Derek made 42 catches.

Now, calculate the catches Tammy did:
- Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did.

First, find a third of Derrick's catches:
\[ \frac{42}{3} = 14 \]

Then, add 16 to this result:
\[ 14 + 16 = 30 \]

Therefore, Tammy caught the ball 30 times.

Joe caught the ball 23 times.

Let's calculate Derek's catches based on the information provided:
Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did.
So, Derek's catches = 2 * Joe's catches - 4
= 2 * 23 - 4
= 46 - 4
= 42 times

Now we need to calculate Tammy's catches:
Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the catches Derek did.
So, Tammy's catches = (1/3 * Derek's catches) + 16
= (1/3 * 42) + 16
= 14 + 16

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know Joe caught the ball 23 times.
2. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Let \( J \) represent the number of catches Joe made. So, Derek's catches are \( 2J - 4 \).
3. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. Let \( D \) represent the number of catches Derek made. So, Tammy's catches are \( \frac{D}{3} + 16 \).

First, let's find how many times Derek caught the ball:
\[ J = 23 \]
\[ D = 2J - 4 = 2(23) - 4 = 46 - 4 = 42 \]

Now, let's find out how many times Tammy caught the ball:
\[ \frac{D}{3} + 16 = \frac{42}{3} + 16 = 14 + 16 = 30 \]
