First, we need to calculate the total cost of all the drinks Sandy ordered. 

- Three cappuccinos cost: \(3 \times $2 = $6\)
- Two iced teas cost: \(2 \times $3 = $6\)
- Two cafe lattes cost: \(2 \times $1.5 = $3\)
- Two espressos cost: \(2 \times $1 = $2\)

Adding these up: \( $6 + $6 + $3 + $2 = $17 \)

Sandy paid with a $20 bill, so the change she should receive back is: $20 - $17 = $3

Therefore, Sandy receives back $3 in change.

To determine how much change Sandy receives back for a twenty-dollar bill, we need to calculate the total cost of the drinks she orders and then subtract that from $20.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of drink:
- Cappuccinos cost $2 each, and Sandy orders 3, so the total cost for cappuccinos is 3 * $2 = $6.
- Iced teas cost $3 each, and Sandy orders 2, so the total cost for iced teas is 2 * $3 = $6.
- Cafe lattes cost $1.5 each, and Sandy orders 2, so the total cost for cafe lattes is 2 * $1.5 = $3.
- Espressos cost $1 each, and Sandy orders 2, so the total cost for espressos is 2 * $1 = $2.

Next, we add up all the costs to find the total cost of the drinks:
- Total cost = Cost of cappuccinos + Cost of iced teas + Cost of cafe lattes + Cost of espressos
- Total cost = $6 + $6 + $3 + $2 = $17

Sandy paid with a twenty-dollar bill, so the change she receives is:
- Change = $20 - Total cost = $20 - $17 = $3

Therefore, Sandy receives $3 back as change.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of drink Sandy ordered:

- Cappuccinos: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars
- Iced teas: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars
- Cafe lattes: \(2 \times 1.5 = 3\) dollars
- Espressos: \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars

Next, we add up the total cost of all the drinks:

\(6\) (cappuccinos) \(+ 6\) (iced teas) \(+ 3\) (cafe lattes) \(+ 2\) (espressos) \(= 17\) dollars

Sandy paid with a twenty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost from the twenty dollars:

\(20 - 17 = 3\) dollars

Therefore, Sandy receives $3 back in change.

Now, we add up all the costs:
$6 (cappuccinos) + $6 (iced teas) + $3 (cafe lattes) + $2 (espressos) = $17

Sandy paid with a twenty-dollar bill, so the change she should receive back is:
$20 - $17 = $3
