system
Mrs. Wilsborough spent $100 x 2 = $200 on the VIP tickets.
She spent $50 x 3 = $150 on the regular tickets.
So, she spent $200 + $150 = $350 in total.

Therefore, Mrs. Wilsborough saved $500 - $350 = $150 after she buys the tickets.

First, calculate the total cost of the VIP tickets: \(2 \times \$100 = \$200\).

Next, calculate the total cost of the regular tickets: \(3 \times \$50 = \$150\).

Now, add the costs of both types of tickets to find the total cost of all tickets: \(\$200 + \$150 = \$350\).

Finally, subtract the total cost of the tickets from Mrs. Wilsborough's savings to find out how much she has left: \(\$500 - \$350 = \$150\).

The cost of 2 VIP tickets is 2 * $100 = $200.

To determine how much of her savings Mrs. Wilsborough has left after buying the tickets, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract this cost from her initial savings.

Cost of VIP tickets: 2 tickets * $100/ticket = $200
Cost of regular tickets: 3 tickets * $50/ticket = $150

Total cost of tickets: $200 + $150 = $350

Initial savings: $500

Amount left after buying tickets: $500 - $350 = $150

system
To find out how much Mrs. Wilsborough has left after buying the tickets, we first need to determine the total cost of the tickets she purchased.

For the VIP tickets:
2 VIP tickets * $100 each = $200

For the regular tickets:
3 regular tickets * $50 each = $150

Now, we add the cost of the VIP tickets and the regular tickets to get the total cost:
$200 (VIP tickets) + $150 (regular tickets) = $350

Mrs. Wilsborough saved $500, and the total cost of the tickets is $350. So, we subtract the total cost from her savings to find out how much she has left:
$500 (savings) - $350 (total cost) = $150

Thus, Mrs. Wilsborough has $150 of her savings left after she buys the tickets.
