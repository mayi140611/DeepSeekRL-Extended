<reasoning>
Carla needs 10 minutes to cook a batch of waffles and 6 minutes to cook 1 steak. To cook 3 steaks, it will take her \(3 \times 6 = 18\) minutes.

Adding the time to cook the waffles and the steaks together:

\[18 \, \text{minutes} + 10 \, \text{minutes} = 28 \, \text{minutes}\]

So, the total time to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles is 28 minutes.

<reasoning>
To calculate the total time Carla will take to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles, we need to add the cooking times for each item.

The time to cook 3 steaks at 6 minutes per steak:
\[ 3 \text{ steaks} \times 6 \text{ minutes per steak} = 18 \text{ minutes} \]

The time to cook a batch of waffles at 10 minutes:
\[ 1 \text{ batch of waffles} \times 10 \text{ minutes per batch} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 18 \text{ minutes (steaks)} + 10 \text{ minutes (waffles)} = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Carla 28 minutes to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles.

To determine the total time Carla will need, we need to add the time it takes to cook each steak and the waffles separately.

First, the time to cook 3 steaks:
- It takes 6 minutes to cook one steak.
- Therefore, for 3 steaks, the time is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) minutes.

Next, the time to cook a batch of waffles:
- It takes 10 minutes to cook a batch of waffles.

Now, we add the time for the steaks and the waffles:
- 18 minutes (for the steaks) + 10 minutes (for the waffles) = 28 minutes.

So, the total time will be 28 minutes.

To determine how long it will take Carla to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles, we need to calculate the time required for each activity separately and then sum them up.

1. Time to cook 3 steaks:
   - Each steak takes 6 minutes to cook.
   - Therefore, for 3 steaks, the total time is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) minutes.

2. Time to cook a batch of waffles:
   - A batch of waffles takes 10 minutes to cook.

3. Total time:
   - Adding the time for the steaks and the waffles gives us \(18 + 10 = 28\) minutes.

Therefore, it will take Carla 28 minutes to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles.

Carla can cook a batch of waffles in 10 minutes and a chicken-fried steak in 6 minutes. If she cooks a steak and a batch of waffles in one session, the time required would be the maximum time between the cooking times, which is 10 minutes.

Carla wants to cook 3 steaks, and each steak and waffles combo takes 10 minutes. So, in one session, she can cook 3 steaks.

Since she needs to cook 3 steaks, and each session is 10 minutes, the total time required would be 3 sessions * 10 minutes/session.

Let's calculate the total time.

To determine how long it will take Carla to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles, we first calculate the time required for each.

- Cooking a batch of waffles takes 10 minutes.
- Cooking chicken-fried steak takes 6 minutes.

Since Carla needs to cook 3 steaks, the total time for the steaks would be:
\[ 3 \text{ steaks} \times 6 \text{ minutes/steak} = 18 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time for the waffles:
\[ 18 \text{ minutes} (steaks) + 10 \text{ minutes} (waffles) = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Carla 28 minutes to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles.

First, we need to determine the total amount of time Carla will take to cook 3 steaks. Since it takes her 6 minutes to cook one steak, the total time to cook 3 steaks will be \(3 \times 6 = 18\) minutes.

Next, we should note that Carla also needs to cook an additional batch of waffles. It takes her 10 minutes to cook a batch of waffles. Therefore, we will add these 10 minutes to the initial 18 minutes.

Total time = Time to cook 3 steaks + Time to cook a batch of waffles
Total time = 18 minutes + 10 minutes = 28 minutes.

Therefore, it will take her 28 minutes to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles.

Now summing up these times:

To determine the total time Carla will take to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles, we need to calculate the time required for each task and then sum them up.

1. Carla can cook a batch of waffles in 10 minutes.
2. Carla can cook a chicken-fried steak in 6 minutes.

For 3 steaks, we simply multiply the time it takes to cook one steak by 3:
\[ 3 \text{ steaks} \times 6 \text{ minutes/steak} = 18 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time it takes to cook the batch of waffles:
\[ 18 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles is 28 minutes.
