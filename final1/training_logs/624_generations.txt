To determine how many minutes will be left when Jessica finishes the exam, we need to calculate the average time she spends per question and then apply that to the total number of questions she needs to answer.

First, let's find out how many questions she answers per minute:
- Jessica has used 12 minutes to answer 16 questions.
- Therefore, she answers \( \frac{16 \text{ questions}}{12 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ questions per minute} \).

Next, let's calculate how many questions she will have left after the exam:
- Jessica needs to answer all 80 questions to complete the exam.
- She has already answered 16 questions.
- Therefore, she will have \( 80 - 16 = 64 \) questions left to answer.

Now, let's determine how much time it will take her to answer the remaining 64 questions at her current pace:
- Since she answers \( \frac{4}{3} \) questions per minute, it will take her \( \frac{64}{\frac{4}{3}} \) minutes to answer the remaining questions.
- Simplifying this, \( \frac{64}{\frac{4}{3}} = 64 \times \frac{3}{4} = 48 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, since the exam is one hour long and she has already used 12 minutes, we subtract the time she has already spent from the total time to find out how much time is left:
- One hour is 60 minutes.
- Jessica has already spent 12 minutes.
- Therefore, there is \( 60 - 12 = 48 \) minutes left.

So, if Jessica keeps up her current pace, there will be 48 minutes left when she finishes the exam.

To determine how many minutes will be left when Jessica finishes the exam, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Jessica spends on each question.
2. Determine how many questions she has left to answer.
3. Calculate the time required to answer the remaining questions.
4. Subtract the time required to answer the remaining questions from the total time.

First, let's calculate the time spent on each question. Jessica has used 12 minutes for 16 questions, so the time spent per question is:
\[ \text{Time per question} = \frac{12 \text{ minutes}}{16 \text{ questions}} = 0.75 \text{ minutes per question} \]

Next, we need to determine how many questions are left to answer. Since there are 80 questions in total and she has answered 16 questions, the number of questions left is:
\[ \text{Questions left} = 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ questions} \]

Now, we calculate the time required to answer the remaining 64 questions. Since each question takes 0.75 minutes, the time required is:
\[ \text{Time for remaining questions} = 64 \text{ questions} \times 0.75 \text{ minutes per question} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we subtract the time required to answer the remaining questions from the total time available. Jessica has one hour, which is 60 minutes, so the remaining time is:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 60 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, if Jessica keeps up this same pace, there will be \(\boxed{12}\) minutes left when she finishes the exam.

Reasoning:
First, we need to determine the rate at which Jessica is completing the exam. She has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes. To find her rate in questions per minute, we divide 16 questions by 12 minutes:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{16 \text{ questions}}{12 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ questions}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now we need to find out how many questions she will answer in the remaining 54 minutes of her time (60 minutes - 12 minutes already spent). To do this, we multiply her rate by the remaining time:
\[ \text{Questions remaining} = \frac{4 \text{ questions}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \times 54 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Questions remaining} = 68 \text{ questions} \]

Since she has 80 questions in total, the number of questions she will have answered by the end is:
\[ \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions remaining} = 80 - 68 = 12 \text{ questions} \]

Jessica takes 2 minutes extra to answer each question (12 minutes for 16 questions). To find the total time she will take for the remaining 12 questions, we multiply the time per question by 12:
\[ \text{Time for 12 questions} = 2 \text{ minutes/question} \times 12 \text{ questions} = 24 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, after answering the remaining questions, she will have spent:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

So, if she keeps up this same pace, she will finish the exam 24 minutes after she starts, leaving 24 minutes before she ends the exam.

Jessica has answered 16 out of 80 questions, which means she answered \( \frac{16}{80} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \) of the questions. If she keeps this same pace, then 1 question will take her \( \frac{12}{16} \) minutes, which simplifies to \( \frac{3}{4} \) minutes for one question. 

There are 80 questions in total, so the time it would take her to answer all questions under this pace is \( 80 \times \frac{3}{4} = 60 \) minutes. Since she has one hour (60 minutes) to take the exam, when she finishes answering, there will be \( 60 - 60 = 0 \) minutes left.

To find out how many minutes Jessica has left when she finishes the exam, let's calculate the total time she spends on each question.

Given:
- She has used 12 minutes on 16 questions.
- She has 1 hour to complete the exam, which is 60 minutes.

First, let's find out how much time it takes her to solve each question. Since 12 minutes are spent on 16 questions, the time per question is:
\[ \text{Time per question} = \frac{12 \text{ minutes}}{16 \text{ questions}} = 0.75 \text{ minutes per question} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she will spend on the remaining 64 questions (since she has answered 16 out of 80):
\[ \text{Time for remaining questions} = 64 \text{ questions} \times 0.75 \text{ minutes per question} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Since she has 60 minutes in total to complete the exam:
\[ \text{Total time spent} = 12 \text{ minutes (already used)} + 48 \text{ minutes (remaining)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, she will finish the exam in 60 minutes.

\[ \text{Time left} = 60 \text{ minutes total} - 60 \text{ minutes spent} = 0 \text{ minutes} \]

Jessica has a total of 60 minutes for the exam, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

She has already used 12 minutes, so there are \(60 - 12 = 48\) minutes left in the exam.

She has answered 16 out of 80 questions, which means she has completed \( \frac{16}{80} = 0.2 \) of the exam so far.

If she continues at the same pace (0.2 of the exam per 0.2 minutes), she will finish the exam in:

\[
\frac{1}{0.2} \times \frac{48}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

After finishing, she will have:

\[
48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes left in the exam}
\]

So, she will have 43 minutes left when she finishes the exam, assuming she maintains this pace.

Reasoning:

To determine how long Jessica has left, we first need to find the rate at which she is completing the questions and then apply that rate to the total time of the exam.

1. Jessica has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes.
   So, her rate is \( \frac{16 \text{ questions}}{12 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ questions per minute} \).

2. The total time for the exam is 60 minutes (1 hour).
   So, the total number of questions in an hour is \( 80 \text{ questions} \).

3. Using her rate, the total time to complete the exam is \( \frac{80 \text{ questions}}{\frac{4}{3} \text{ questions per minute}} = \frac{80 \times 3}{4} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

4. Since the exam is 60 minutes and she has already used 12 minutes for the current answers, the time left when she finishes the exam is \( 60 - 12 = 48 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, let's verify her pace using the remaining time:
5. In the next 48 minutes, she will complete \( \frac{4}{3} \times 48 = 64 \text{ questions} \).

6. Since 64 questions would take her more than an hour, this confirms her pace holds.

Therefore, when she finishes the exam, there will be \( 60 - 12 = 48 \) minutes left.

First, determine how long it takes Jessica to answer one question:

12 minutes / 16 questions = 0.75 minutes per question

Next, determine how many questions Jessica needs to answer to complete the exam:

80 questions / 16 questions per hour = 5 hours

Now, convert the hours to minutes:

5 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 300 minutes

Since Jessica has already used 12 minutes, subtract that from the total exam duration:

300 minutes - 12 minutes = 288 minutes remaining

Given that Jessica takes 0.75 minutes to answer each question, calculate the total time she will spend answering the remaining questions:

288 minutes remaining / 0.75 minutes per question = 384 questions

Now, multiply the number of remaining questions by the time it takes to answer each question:

384 questions * 0.75 minutes per question = 288 minutes

Jessica will use 288 more minutes to finish the exam.

To find out how many minutes are left, subtract the time spent on the remaining questions from the initial hour:

60 minutes - 288 minutes = -228 minutes

Since the above calculation indicates a negative value, it means Jessica will not finish the exam within the hour she has. She will be short by:

228 minutes

Jessica answered 16 out of 80 questions, which means she has answered a certain proportion of the total time. To find out how much time she used per question, we divide the time she used by the number of questions she answered:

\[ \text{Time per question} = \frac{12 \text{ minutes}}{16 \text{ questions}} = 0.75 \text{ minutes per question} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Jessica has:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 12 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes remaining in the hour} \]

Since she uses 0.75 minutes per question, to finish the remaining 64 questions:

\[ 64 \text{ questions} \times 0.75 \text{ minutes per question} = 48 \text{ minutes remaining} \]

Adding the remaining 2 minutes after finishing the 64th question:

\[ 48 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 46 \text{ minutes remaining} \]

So, when she finishes the exam, there will be 46 minutes left.

Jessica has used 12 minutes out of 60 minutes (1 hour), so she has \(60 - 12 = 48\) minutes left for the exam. Since 80 questions are in total, and she has answered 16, this means there are \(80 - 16 = 64\) questions left to answer. If she uses the same pace, then for every 16 questions she answers, she uses 12 minutes. The total time to finish the exam will be \(\frac{64}{16} \times 12 = 4 \times 12 = 48\) minutes. So, she will use all the time taken for the questions already answered, plus the time for the remaining questions.

To determine how many minutes Jessica will have left when she finishes the exam, we need to first find out her pace and then calculate how much time she will spend answering the remaining questions.

1. **Calculate Jessica's pace for answering questions:**
   - Jessica has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes.
   - So, her pace is 12 minutes / 16 questions = 0.75 minutes per question.

2. **Calculate the total time left for the exam:**
   - The exam takes 60 minutes in total.
   - Jessica has used 12 minutes of her time.
   - Therefore, she has 60 minutes - 12 minutes = 48 minutes left.

3. **Determine the number of questions left to answer:**
   - There are 80 questions in total.
   - Jessica has already answered 16 questions.
   - So, she has 80 questions - 16 questions = 64 questions left.

4. **Calculate the time needed to answer the remaining questions:**
   - At a pace of 0.75 minutes per question, the time needed to answer 64 questions is 64 questions * 0.75 minutes/question = 48 minutes.

5. **Calculate the remaining time when she finishes:**
   - Jessica has 48 minutes left in the exam.
   - She spends 48 minutes on the remaining questions.
   - Therefore, the remaining time when she finishes is 48 minutes - 48 minutes = 0 minutes.

So, when Jessica finishes the exam, there will be 0 minutes left.

To determine how many minutes will be left when Jessica finishes the exam, we first need to find out how long she spends answering each question and then calculate these values accordingly.

Given data:
Time spent so far: 12 minutes
Number of questions answered: 16
Total questions: 80
Total time for the exam: 60 minutes

First, we calculate the rate at which Jessica is answering questions:
\[ \text{Time per question} = \frac{\text{Total time available}}{\text{Total questions}} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{80 \text{ questions}} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ minutes per question} \]

Since Jessica has been answering questions for 12 minutes:
\[ \text{Time spent answering questions} = 16 \text{ questions} \times \frac{3}{4} \text{ minutes per question} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the time spent answering questions is exactly equal to the time given, and she is already answering questions at a rate that aligns perfectly with the allotted time, we need to determine the remaining time for the exam if she were to complete all questions at the same pace.

\[ \text{Remaining questions} = 80 \text{ questions} - 16 \text{ questions} = 64 \text{ questions} \]
\[ \text{Time for remaining questions} = 64 \text{ questions} \times \frac{3}{4} \text{ minutes per question} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Total time available:
\[ \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, if she completes the exam at this pace, the time left once she finishes will be:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent answering questions} = 60 \text{ minutes} - 12 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

However, since she has already spent exactly 12 minutes answering the current 16 questions, she will finish in exactly 80 minutes total when she answers all questions, leaving:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 80 \text{ minutes} - 60 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, she will have 20 minutes left when she finishes the exam.

To determine how many minutes will be left when Jessica finishes the exam, we first need to calculate her current pace and then use it to find out how much time she has left.

1. **Determine the current pace:**
   - Jessica has answered 16 questions out of 80.
   - She has used 12 minutes to answer 16 questions.
   - Therefore, the time per question is \( \frac{12 \text{ minutes}}{16 \text{ questions}} = 0.75 \text{ minutes per question} \).

2. **Calculate the total time needed to finish the exam:**
   - The total number of questions is 80.
   - The time needed to answer all questions at the current pace is \( 80 \text{ questions} \times 0.75 \text{ minutes/question} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Determine the time left when she finishes the exam:**
   - Jessica has 60 minutes in total.
   - She has already spent 12 minutes on the exam.
   - Therefore, the time left when she finishes the exam is \( 60 \text{ minutes} - 12 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes} \).

**Reasoning:**
The time per question was calculated to be 0.75 minutes per question, which means for every question Jessica skips, she loses 0.75 minutes. By knowing this pace, we can calculate the total time spent and thus the leftover time.
