First, we need to determine the total number of crayons Jamal bought. Since she purchased 4 half dozen crayons, we can calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Crayons} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Next, we know that each crayon costs $2. Therefore, to find the total cost of all the crayons, we multiply the number of crayons by the price per crayon:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Thus, the total cost of the crayons that Jamal bought is $48.

To find the total cost of the crayons that Jamal bought, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total number of crayons Jamal bought. Since she bought 4 half dozens, we know that half dozen is 6 crayons, so 4 half dozens is 4 * 6 = 24 crayons.

2. Next, calculate the total cost of the crayons by multiplying the number of crayons by the price per crayon. Since the price per crayon is $2, we can calculate the total cost as 24 * $2 = $48.

3. Therefore, the total cost of the crayons that Jamal bought is $48.

To find the total cost of the crayons, we first need to determine the total number of crayons Jamal bought.

A dozen consists of 12 crayons, so a half dozen would be half of that. Therefore, a half dozen is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \, \text{crayons} \]

Jamal bought 4 half dozens, so the total number of crayons is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \, \text{crayons} \]

Now, since each crayon costs $2, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost per crayon:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

So, the total cost of the crayons that Jamal bought is $48.

To determine the total cost of the crayons Jamal bought, we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the total number of crayons Jamal bought.
2. Multiply the total number of crayons by the cost per crayon.

First, we know Jamal bought 4 half dozen crayons. Since a dozen equals 12, a half dozen is:

So, 4 half dozen is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we know the cost of each crayon is $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 24 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the crayons that Jamal bought is 48 dollars.
