<reasoning>
Let's denote the length of Jenny's snake as \( x \) inches.

According to the problem, Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake. Therefore, Jake's snake is \( x + 12 \) inches long.

The combined length of both snakes is given as 70 inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 12) = 70 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 2x + 12 = 70 \]
\[ 2x = 70 - 12 \]
\[ 2x = 58 \]
\[ x = 29 \]

So, Jenny's snake is 29 inches long. Now, we need to find the length of Jake's snake, which is \( x + 12 \):

\[ x + 12 = 29 + 12 = 41 \]

Therefore, Jake's snake is 41 inches long.

Let's denote the length of Jenny's snake as \( J \) inches. According to the problem, Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake, so we can write Jake's snake's length as \( J + 12 \) inches.

The combined length of the two snakes is given as 70 inches. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ J + (J + 12) = 70 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2J + 12 = 70 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2J = 58 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ J = 29 \]

So, Jenny's snake is 29 inches long. Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's, so:
\[ \text{Jake's snake length} = 29 + 12 = 41 \text{ inches} \]

<reasoning>
Let's assume the length of Jenny's snake is \( J \) inches.
According to the information given,Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake, so Jake's snake length is \( J + 12 \) inches.
The combined length of the two snakes is 70 inches.
So we have the equation: 
\( J + (J + 12) = 70 \)
Now we can solve for \( J \) and then for the length of Jake's snake.

70 - 12 = 58
58 / 2 = 29

To solve this problem, let's first denote the length of Jenny's snake as \( J \) inches. According to the information given:

1. Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's (\( J + 12 \)).
2. The combined length of both snakes is 70 inches (\( J + J + 12 = 70 \)).

Now, we can set up the equation:

\[ J + J + 12 = 70 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 2J + 12 = 70 \]

To find \( J \), we subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 2J = 58 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ J = 29 \]

So, Jenny's snake is 29 inches long. 

To find the length of Jake's snake, we add 12 inches:

\[ Jake's\ snake = J + 12 = 29 + 12 = 41 \]

Therefore, Jake's snake is 41 inches long.

Let's define the length of Jenny's snake as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake, which means Jake's snake is \( x + 12 \) inches long.

We know the combined length of both snakes is 70 inches. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + (x + 12) = 70 \]

Now, let's combine like terms:
\[ 2x + 12 = 70 \]

Next, we'll isolate \( x \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 58 \]

Then, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ x = 29 \]

So, Jenny's snake is 29 inches long. Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's, so we add 12 to the length of Jenny's snake:
\[ x + 12 = 29 + 12 = 41 \]

Therefore, Jake's snake is 41 inches long.

Let's denote the length of Jenny's snake as \( J \). According to the problem, Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake, which can be expressed as \( J + 12 \). The total length of both snakes together is 70 inches. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ J + (J + 12) = 70 \]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 2J + 12 = 70 \]

Next, isolate \( 2J \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:
\[ 2J = 58 \]

Then, solve for \( J \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ J = 29 \]

So, the length of Jenny's snake is 29 inches. Since Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake, we can find the length of Jake's snake by adding 12 to the length of Jenny's snake:
\[ \text{Length of Jake's snake} = J + 12 = 29 + 12 = 41 \]

Therefore, Jake's snake is 41 inches long.

Let's denote the length of Penny's snake as \( p \) inches. According to the problem, Jake's snake is \( 12 \) inches longer than Penny's snake, so the length of Jake's snake is \( p + 12 \) inches. The two snakes combined have a length of \( 70 \) inches, so we can write the equation:
\[ p + (p + 12) = 70 \]

Now we will solve this equation to find \( p \).

First, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2p + 12 = 70 \]

Then we subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( p \):
\[ 2p = 58 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( p \):
\[ p = 29 \]

Therefore, the length of Penny's snake is 29 inches. Since Jake's snake is 12 inches longer, the length of Jake's snake is:
