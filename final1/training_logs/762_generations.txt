To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of clients who need either vegan, kosher, or both meals.

1. Calculate the total number of clients who need either vegan or kosher meals:
   - Number of clients needing vegan meals = 7
   - Number of clients needing kosher meals = 8
   - Number of clients needing both meals = 3

2. Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
   - Number of clients needing either meal = 7 + 8 - 3 = 12

3. Subtract the number of clients who need either meal from the total number of clients to find those who need neither:
   - Total number of clients = 30
   - Number of clients needing either meal = 12
   - Number of clients needing neither meal = 30 - 12 = 18

Therefore, the total number of meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan is 18.

To find out how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, we need to find the number of clients who need either vegan or kosher meals. Since 3 clients need both, the number of clients needing either vegan or kosher meals is:
\[ (7 - 3) + (8 - 3) = 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Now, we need to subtract these 9 clients from the total 30 to find out how many have neither:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Thus, Megan delivers 21 meals that are neither kosher nor vegan.

To find out how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, we add the number of clients who need vegan meals and those who need kosher meals: 7 (vegan) + 8 (kosher) = 15 clients.

Then, we subtract the number of clients who need meals that are both vegan and kosher to avoid double-counting: 15 - 3 = 12 clients.

This means that 12 clients are either vegan, kosher, or both. Since Megan has 30 clients in total, the number of clients who are neither kosher nor vegan is:
30 (total clients) - 12 (vegan or kosher) = 18 clients.

Therefore, Megan delivers 18 meals that are neither kosher nor vegan.

To find out how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we need to subtract the total number of clients who need vegan, kosher, or both from the total number of clients.

The total number of clients is 30. The number of clients needing vegan meals is 7. The number of clients needing kosher meals is 8. And the number of clients needing both vegan and kosher meals is 3.

We first calculate the number of clients needing either vegan or kosher meals (or both):
\[ 7 + 8 - 3 = 12 \]

Since this number is higher than the total number of clients (30), it means that some clients are counted twice, so that number (12) must be less than 30 and represents the overlap.

To find the number of clients needing neither vegan nor kosher meals, we subtract the 12 clients needing vegan or kosher meals from the total number of clients:
\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \]

Therefore, Megan delivers 18 meals that are neither kosher nor vegan.

To determine how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we first need to account for the clients who have specific dietary requirements and then subtract those from the total.

1. **Total number of clients:** 30
2. **Vegan clients:** 7
3. **Kosher clients:** 8
4. **Overlap (both vegan and kosher clients):** 3

We use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of clients who need either vegan, kosher, or both.

\[
\text{Clients needing either vegan or kosher} = \text{Vegan clients} + \text{Kosher clients} - \text{Overlap}
\]

\[
\text{Clients needing either or both} = 7 + 8 - 3 = 12
\]

Now, subtract this number from the total number of clients to find the number of clients who do not need either type of meal (neither kosher nor vegan):

\[
\text{Neither kosher nor vegan clients} = \text{Total number of clients} - \text{Clients needing either or both}
\]

\[
\text{Neither kosher nor vegan clients} = 30 - 12 = 18
\]

Therefore, Megan delivers 18 meals that are neither kosher nor vegan.

To determine how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for set theory. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( V \) be the set of clients who need vegan meals, so \( |V| = 7 \).
- Let \( K \) be the set of clients who need kosher meals, so \( |K| = 8 \).
- Let \( V \cap K \) be the set of clients who need meals that are both vegan and kosher, so \( |V \cap K| = 3 \).

We need to find the number of clients who need either vegan or kosher meals (or both). This can be calculated using the formula for the union of two sets:

\[
|V \cup K| = |V| + |K| - |V \cap K|
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
|V \cup K| = 7 + 8 - 3 = 12
\]

This means that there are 12 clients who need either vegan or kosher meals (or both). Since Megan has 30 clients in total, the number of clients who need neither vegan nor kosher meals is:

\[
30 - |V \cup K| = 30 - 12 = 18
\]

Therefore, Megan delivers 18 meals that are neither kosher nor vegan.

To determine the number of meals that are neither kosher nor vegan, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of clients: 30
- Number of clients needing vegan meals: 7
- Number of clients needing kosher meals: 8
- Number of clients needing meals that are both vegan and kosher: 3

First, let's calculate the total number of clients needing vegan or kosher meals:
\[
7 + 8 - 3 = 12
\]
This calculation accounts for the overlap between those needing vegan and kosher meals.

Next, to find the number of clients needing either vegan or kosher meals or both, we add this to the total number of clients:
\[
12 + 30 = 42
\]

However, this number exceeds the total number of clients, which indicates an inconsistency. Let's correct this by realizing that the 12 should be subtracted instead of added, as the 3 (both) already includes those being counted in both categories. So, we instead need to find the unique clients needing either or both:

\[
(7 + 8) - 3 = 12 - 3 + 30 = 39
\]

Now, to find the number of clients needing neither vegan nor kosher meals, we subtract the unique clients needing either or both from the total number of clients:
\[
30 - 39 = -9
\]

This negative result indicates an error in the initial setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem by focusing on the clients needing either or both, and those needing neither:

1. Unique clients needing vegan or kosher meals: \(7 + 8 - 3 = 12\)
2. Total clients needing either or both: \(12\)
3. Subtract from total clients:
\[
30 - 12 = 18
\]

Thus, the number of meals that are neither kosher nor vegan is 18.

To find out how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many meals meet at least one of the criteria.

Let's denote:
- The number of clients needing vegan meals as \(V = 7\),
- The number of clients needing kosher meals as \(K = 8\),
- The number of clients needing meals that are both vegan and kosher as \(B = 3\).

The total number of clients is 30.

If we were to simply add the number of vegan clients and the number of kosher clients, we would count the clients needing both meals twice. Therefore, the number of clients needing at least one of the meals is calculated as follows:

- Clients needing vegan meals \(V = 7\),
- Clients needing kosher meals \(K = 8\),
- Clients needing both vegan and kosher meals \(B = 3\).

Total clients needing at least one of the meals is \(V + K - B = 7 + 8 - 3 = 12\).

Now, to find out how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we subtract the total number of clients needing at least one type of meal from the total number of clients:
\[ \text{Total clients} - \text{At least one type of meal} = 30 - 12 = 18. \]

So, Megan delivers 18 meals that are neither kosher nor vegan.

To find out how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we can start by identifying the total number of clients and those who have specific dietary restrictions.

We know there are 30 clients in total, 7 need vegan meals, and 8 need kosher meals. Since 3 people need meals that are both vegan and kosher, we must subtract this number from the totals of clients needing vegan and kosher meals to avoid double-counting.

So the calculation is:
- Vegan meals only: 7 - 3 = 4
- Kosher meals only: 8 - 3 = 5
- Both vegan and kosher: 3

Adding these together gives the total number of meals with specific dietary restrictions: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12.

Finally, subtract this number from the total number of clients to find the number of meals that are neither kosher nor vegan: 30 - 12 = 18.

To find out how many meals are neither kosher nor vegan, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the number of clients who need either vegan or kosher meals, and then subtract this from the total number of clients.

First, we know:
- Total clients = 30
- Vegan meals = 7
- Kosher meals = 8
- Both vegan and kosher (overlap) = 3

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
Number of customers needing at least one type of meal = Vegan meals + Kosher meals - Both vegan and kosher

Substituting the numbers:
= 7 + 8 - 3
= 15

Therefore, the number of clients needing at least one type of meal is 15.

Now, to find the number of clients needing neither type of meal:
Total clients - Number of clients needing at least one type of meal
= 30 - 15
= 15

So, Megan delivers 15 meals that are neither kosher nor vegan.

To determine how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we first make some assumptions about the overlap between the two groups.

We know that out of the 30 clients, 7 need vegan meals, 8 need kosher meals, and 3 people need meals that are both vegan and kosher. We denote the following:
- Let \( V \) be the set of clients needing vegan meals.
- Let \( K \) be the set of clients needing kosher meals.
- And the intersection \( V \cap K \) is the set of clients needing both vegan and kosher meals.

The number of clients needing vegan meals, not including those with both preferences, is \( |V| - |V \cap K| = 7 - 3 = 4 \).

Similarly, the number of clients needing kosher meals, not including those with both preferences, is \( |K| - |V \cap K| = 8 - 3 = 5 \).

The total number of clients for whom meals are needed is 30. So, the number of clients needing meals that are neither kosher nor vegan is the total minus those needing vegan or kosher meals, which is \( 30 - (4 + 5 - 3) \).

By adding them together, we find that:

\(4 + 5 - 3 = 6\),

so the number of clients needing meals that are neither kosher nor vegan is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So Megan delivers 24 meals that are neither kosher nor vegan.

To determine the number of meals that are neither kosher nor vegan, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, we note that:
- Total number of clients = 30
- Number of clients needing vegan meals (V) = 7
- Number of clients needing kosher meals (K) = 8
- Number of clients needing both vegan and kosher meals (V ∩ K) = 3

The formula for the number of clients needing either vegan or kosher meals or both is:
\[ V \cup K = V + K - V \cap K \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ V \cup K = 7 + 8 - 3 = 12 \]

This means that 12 clients need either vegan or kosher meals. Therefore, the number of clients needing neither is:

To determine how many meals Megan delivers that are neither kosher nor vegan, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of clients who need either vegan or kosher meals (or both). This is denoted as \(7 + 8 - 3\) (since those who need both are counted twice).
2. Subtract this number from the total number of clients to find the number of clients who need neither kosher nor vegan meals.

Calculation:
\(7 + 8 - 3 = 12\). 

So, 12 clients need either vegan, kosher, or both meals. Since there are 30 clients total, the number of clients who need neither kosher nor vegan meals is:
