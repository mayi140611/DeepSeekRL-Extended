Let's denote the number of large animals as \( L \) and the number of small animals as \( S \). According to the problem, large animals take 4 sticks of wax, and small animals take 2 sticks. It's also stated that Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals, which can be mathematically represented as \( S = 3L \).

We're also told that she used 12 sticks of wax for small animals. Since each small animal requires 2 sticks, we can set up the equation \( 2 \cdot S = 12 \) to find out how many small animals she made.

Solving for \( S \) gives:
\[
2 \cdot S = 12
\]
\[
S = \frac{12}{2}
\]
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Loraine made 6 small animals.

Knowing that \( S = 3L \), we can find the number of large animals:
\[
6 = 3L
\]
\[
L = \frac{6}{3}
\]
\[
L = 2
\]

Loraine made 2 large animals.

To find the total number of sticks of wax used for large animals, we multiply the number of large animals by the amount of wax each takes:
\[
4 \cdot L = 4 \cdot 2 = 8
\]

Now, we can calculate the total sticks of wax used for all animals by adding the wax used for large and small animals:
\[
8 \text{ (for large animals)} + 12 \text{ (for small animals)} = 20
\]

Therefore, Loraine used \(\boxed{20}\) sticks of wax to make all the animals.

First, we need to find out how many wax sticks Loraine uses for large animals. Since small animals take 2 sticks and she made 3 times as many small animals as large animals, we can say \( 3 \times \frac{2}{2} = 3 \) large animals use \(3 \times 4 = 12\) wax sticks. The total number of sticks Loraine used is \(2 \times 3 + 4 \times 3 = 12 + 12 = 24\).

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the number of large animals Loraine made as L and the number of small animals as S. According to the problem, small animals take two sticks of wax each, and she used 12 sticks of wax for small animals. Therefore, S * 2 = 12. We can solve for S: S = 12 / 2 = 6 small animals.

The problem also states that Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals. So, S = 3L. We already found out S to be 6, so we can substitute this value back in: 6 = 3L. Solving for L: L = 6 / 3 = 2 large animals.

Now we know Loraine made 2 large animals and 6 small animals. Large animals take 4 sticks of wax each, so she used 2 * 4 = 8 sticks of wax for the large animals. Small animals take 2 sticks of wax each, so she used 6 * 2 = 12 sticks of wax for the small animals.

To find the total amount of wax used, we add the wax for the large animals and the small animals: 8 + 12 = 20 sticks of wax.

Loraine made 3 small animals for each large animal. Let's denote the number of large animals as \( L \). Therefore, the number of small animals is \( 3L \).

According to the given information, Loraine used 12 sticks of wax for small animals, and each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3L \times 2 = 12 \]
\[ 6L = 12 \]
\[ L = 2 \]

So, Loraine made 2 large animals and \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) small animals.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sticks of wax used. Each large animal takes 4 sticks of wax, so the total for large animals is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax, so the total for small animals is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of sticks of wax Loraine used is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The wax used to make small animals is 12 sticks, because each large animal requires four sticks and small animals require two sticks. The fraction of the wax that was used to make small animals, in terms of the fraction of the total wax used, is 2/4. Three times as many small animals as large animals was 12/(2/4) = 12*(4/2) = 24. This is therefore the total number of small animals Loraine made. The large animals therefore made 24/3 = 8. The total number of wax sticks used to make all the animals is 24*(2) + 8*(4) = 40+32 = 72.

Let \( L \) represent the number of large animals and \( S \) represent the number of small animals. According to the problem, Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals, so we have:

\[ S = 3L \]

Each small animal requires 2 sticks of wax, and she used 12 sticks of wax for the small animals. Therefore, the total number of sticks of wax used for the small animals is:

\[ 2S = 12 \]

Solving for \( S \), we get:

\[ S = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Since \( S = 3L \), we can now find \( L \):

\[ 6 = 3L \]
\[ L = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, Loraine made 2 large animals and 6 small animals. Each large animal requires 4 sticks of wax, so the number of sticks of wax used for the large animals is:

\[ 4L = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

The total number of sticks of wax used for all the animals is the sum of the sticks used for the large animals and the small animals:

\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of sticks of wax Loraine used is:

\[
\boxed{20}

Let's denote the number of large animals Loraine made as \( L \) and the number of small animals as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
- Each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax, and she used 12 sticks of wax for all small animals. Therefore, we can write the equation:
  \[
  2S = 12
  \]
- She made three times as many small animals as large animals. Therefore, we can write the equation:
  \[
  S = 3L
  \]

First, solve for \( S \) using the first equation:
\[
2S = 12 \implies S = \frac{12}{2} \implies S = 6
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 6 \) into the second equation to solve for \( L \):
\[
6 = 3L \implies L = \frac{6}{3} \implies L = 2
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of sticks of wax used. We know that each large animal takes 4 sticks of wax:
\[
4L = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ sticks of wax}
\]

Also, each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax:
\[
2S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ sticks of wax}
\]

Thus, the total number of sticks of wax used is:
\[
8 + 12 = 20
\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks of wax used by Loraine is \(\boxed{20}\).

Let's break down the information given:
- Large animals take 4 sticks of wax.
- Small animals take 2 sticks of wax.
- Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals.
- She used 12 sticks of wax for small animals.

First, let's determine the number of small animals Loraine made:
\[ 12 \text{ sticks} \div 2 \text{ sticks per small animal} = 6 \text{ small animals} \]

Next, let's find out how many large animals she made:
\[ 6 \text{ small animals} \div 3 = 2 \text{ large animals} \]

Now, let's calculate the total wax used for large and small animals:
- Wax used for small animal sculptures: \( 6 \text{ small animals} \times 2 \text{ sticks per small animal} = 12 \text{ sticks} \)
- Wax used for large animal sculptures: \( 2 \text{ large animals} \times 4 \text{ sticks per large animal} = 8 \text{ sticks} \)

Adding these together gives the total wax used:
\[ 12 \text{ sticks} + 8 \text{ sticks} = 20 \text{ sticks} \]

Let \( x \) represent the number of large animals Loraine made. Each large animal takes 4 sticks of wax, so the total wax used for large animals is \( 4x \).

Since Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals, the number of small animals she made is \( 3x \). Each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax, so the total wax used for small animals is \( 2 \times 3x = 6x \). We know from the problem statement that Loraine used 12 sticks of wax for small animals, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 6x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]

So, Loraine made 2 large animals. The total number of large animals is 2, and the total number of small animals is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).

The total number of sticks of wax used for all the animals is:
\[ 4 \text{ large animals} \times 4 \text{ sticks per large animal} + 6 \text{ small animals} \times 2 \text{ sticks per small animal} = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Loraine used \(\boxed{28}\) sticks of wax to make all the animals.

Let's denote the number of large animals Loraine made as \( L \) and the number of small animals as \( S \). According to the problem, large animals take 4 sticks of wax each and small animals take 2 sticks of wax each.

We are given that Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 3L \]

We are also given that she used 12 sticks of wax for small animals, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 12 \]

Now we can solve for \( L \) by substituting \( S \) in the first equation:
\[ 12 = 3L \]
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ L = 4 \]

Now we know that Loraine made 4 large animals and 12 small animals. To find out how many sticks of wax she used in total, we calculate the total wax used for large animals and small animals separately and then sum them up.

For large animals, she used:
\[ 4 \text{ (animals)} \times 4 \text{ (sticks per animal)} = 16 \text{ sticks} \]

For small animals, she used:
\[ 12 \text{ (animals)} \times 2 \text{ (sticks per animal)} = 24 \text{ sticks} \]

Now, to find the total number of sticks of wax used, we add the wax used for large and small animals together:
\[ 16 \text{ sticks} + 24 \text{ sticks} = 40 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, Loraine used 40 sticks of wax to make all the animals.

Let's denote the number of large animals as \( L \) and the number of small animals as \( s \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Large animals take 4 sticks of wax each.
2. Small animals take 2 sticks of wax each.
3. She made three times as many small animals as large animals.
4. She used 12 sticks of wax for small animals.

First, let's express the number of small animals in terms of large animals using the third piece of information:
\[
s = 3L
\]

Next, we use the fourth piece of information. Since \( s = 3L \) and each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax, we can find the total number of sticks used for small animals:
\[
s \times 2 = 12
\]
Substituting \( s = 3L \) into the equation, we get:
\[
3L \times 2 = 12
\]
\[
6L = 12
\]
Solving for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{12}{6} = 2
\]

Now that we have the number of large animals (\( L = 2 \)), we can find the number of small animals:
\[
s = 3L = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]

Next, calculate the number of sticks of wax used for large animals:
\[
2L = 2 \times 2 = 4
\]

Finally, calculate the total number of sticks of wax used for all animals:
\[
s + 2L = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the total number of sticks of wax Loraine used is:
\[
\boxed{10}

Let \( L \) represent the number of large animals and \( S \) represent the number of small animals Loraine made. According to the problem, small animals take 2 sticks of wax each and she used a total of 12 sticks for small animals. This gives us the equation:
\[ 2S = 12 \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, Loraine made 6 small animals. 

The problem also states that she made three times as many small animals as large animals. This means:

So, Loraine made 2 large animals.

Next, we calculate the total number of sticks of wax used for the large animals. Each large animal takes 4 sticks of wax. There are \( L = 2 \) large animals, so:
\[ 4L = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]
Thus, Loraine used 8 sticks of wax for the large animals.
