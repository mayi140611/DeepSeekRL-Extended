system
Let's denote the number of miles Kati drives by \( k \).

According to the problem, Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives, so Michelle drives \( 3k \) miles.

Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle's drive, so Tracy drives \( 2 \times 3k + 20 = 6k + 20 \) miles.

The total distance is given as 1000 miles, so we can write the equation as:
\[ k + 3k + (6k + 20) = 1000 \]
\[ k + 3k + 6k + 20 = 1000 \]
\[ 10k + 20 = 1000 \]
\[ 10k = 980 \]
\[ k = 98 \]

So Kati drives 98 miles. Michelle drives \( 3 \times 98 = 294 \) miles.

Therefore, Michelle drives 294 miles.

Let's denote the number of miles Katie drives as \( K \).

According to the problem, Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives. So Michelle drives \( 3K \) miles.

Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle, so Tracy drives \( 2(3K) + 20 = 6K + 20 \) miles.

The total distance for all three is 1000 miles, so we can write the equation:

\( K + 3K + (6K + 20) = 1000 \)

Combining like terms, we get:

\( K + 3K + 6K + 20 = 1000 \)
\( 10K + 20 = 1000 \)

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\( 10K = 980 \)

Divide both sides by 10:

\( K = 98 \)

Now that we know Katie drives 98 miles, we can find out how many miles Michelle drives by multiplying:

\( 3K = 3 \times 98 = 294 \)

So, Michelle drives 294 miles.

Let's denote the number of miles Katie drives as \( K \).

Given:
1. Kati drives \( K \) miles.
2. Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives, so Michelle drives \( 3K \) miles.
3. Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle, so Tracy drives \( 2 \times 3K + 20 = 6K + 20 \) miles.

The total distance of the trip is 1000 miles, so we add up the distances driven by Tracy, Michelle, and Kati:

\[ K + 3K + (6K + 20) = 1000 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 10K + 20 = 1000 \]

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

\[ 10K = 980 \]

Dividing both sides by 10:

\[ K = 98 \]

So, Kati drives 98 miles. 

Since Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives:

\[ \text{Michelle's miles} = 3 \times 98 = 294 \]

Therefore, Michelle drives 294 miles.

system
Let's denote the number of miles driven by Kati as \( x \). Since Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives, Michelle drives \( 3x \) miles. 

According to the problem, Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice the miles driven by Michelle. So, Tracy drives \( 2 \times 3x + 20 = 6x + 20 \) miles.

The total distance of the trip is 1000 miles, which is the sum of the distances driven by Tracy, Michelle, and Kati. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:

\[ x + 3x + (6x + 20) = 1000 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 10x + 20 = 1000 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 10x = 980 \]

Now, divide by 10:

\[ x = 98 \]

So,

\[ 3x = 3 \times 98 = 294 \]

Therefore, Michelle drives 294 miles.

system
Let's denote the number of miles driven by Kati as \( K \).

Given that Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives, we can write:
\[ M = 3K \]

Michelle drives 20 miles more than twice the miles driven by Kati:
\[ M = 2K + 20 \]

Since \( M = 3K \), we can equate the two expressions for \( M \):
\[ 2K + 20 = 3K \]

Now, solve for \( K \):
\[ 20 = K \]
\[ K = 1000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know that Michelle drives \( 3K \), so:
\[ M = 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Michelle drives 3000 miles.

Let's denote the number of miles driven by Katie as \( K \). According to the problem, Michelle drives \( 3K \) miles. Tracy drives \( 20 \) miles more than twice what Michelle drives, so Tracy drives \( 2 \times (3K) + 20 = 6K + 20 \) miles.

The total distance they all drive together is \( 1000 \) miles, so we can set up the following equation based on the distances driven by each person:

\[ K + 3K + (6K + 20) = 1000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 10K + 20 = 1000 \]

Subtract \( 20 \) from both sides to isolate \( 10K \):

\[ 10K = 980 \]

Divide by \( 10 \) to solve for \( K \):

\[ K = 98 \]

Now that we know Katie drives \( 98 \) miles, we can find out how many miles Michelle drives, which is \( 3K \):

\[ \text{Michelle's miles} = 3 \times 98 = 294 \]

So, Michelle drives \( 294 \) miles.

Let's denote the number of miles driven by Katie as \( K \).

According to the problem, Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives, so Michelle drives \( 3K \) miles.

Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice the amount that Michelle drives, so Tracy drives \( 2 \times 3K + 20 = 6K + 20 \) miles.

The total distance driven by Tracy, Michelle, and Katie is 1000 miles. Therefore:

\[ K + 3K + (6K + 20) = 1000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 10K + 20 = 1000 \]

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

system
Let's define the number of miles driven by each person as follows:
- Let \( K \) represent the number of miles Kati drives.
- Let \( M \) represent the number of miles Michelle drives.
- Let \( T \) represent the number of miles Tracy drives.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle:
   \[
   T = 2M + 20
   \]
2. Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives:
   \[
   M = 3K
   \]
3. The total distance driven by all three is 1000 miles:
   \[
   T + M + K = 1000
   \]

We can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[
(2M + 20) + M + K = 1000
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3M + 20 + K = 1000
\]

Next, we substitute \( M = 3K \) into the equation:
\[
3(3K) + 20 + K = 1000
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
9K + 20 + K = 1000
\]
\[
10K + 20 = 1000
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
10K = 980
\]

Divide both sides by 10:
\[
K = 98
\]

Now that we have \( K \), we can find \( M \) using \( M = 3K \):
\[
M = 3 \times 98 = 294
\]

Thus, Michelle drives \(\boxed{294}\) miles.

system
Let's denote the distance driven by Tracy, Michelle, and Kati as \( T \), \( M \), and \( K \) respectively. We have three pieces of information given in the problem:

1. The total distance driven by all three is 1000 miles: \( T + M + K = 1000 \).
2. Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle: \( T = 2M + 20 \).
3. Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives: \( M = 3K \).

First, we substitute \( K \) in terms of \( M \) from the third equation into the first equation:

\[ T + M + K = 1000 \]
\[ T + M + \frac{M}{3} = 1000 \]
\[ T + \frac{4M}{3} = 1000 \]

Next, substitute \( T \) from the second equation into the modified first equation:

\[ 2M + 20 + \frac{4M}{3} = 1000 \]

To clear the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 3:

\[ 6M + 60 + 4M = 3000 \]
\[ 10M + 60 = 3000 \]
\[ 10M = 2940 \]
\[ M = 294 \]

So, Michelle drives \( 294 \) miles. To find out how many miles Tracy and Kati drive, we use the substitutions we made earlier:

\[ T = 2M + 20 = 2(294) + 20 = 588 + 20 = 608 \]
\[ K = \frac{M}{3} = \frac{294}{3} = 98 \]

Thus, Michelle drives \( 294 \) miles.

Let's denote the number of miles Michelle drives as \( M \).

According to the problem, Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle, so Tracy drives \( 2M + 20 \) miles.

We also know that Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives, so Katie drives \( M/3 \) miles.

The total distance for the trip is 1000 miles, so we can write the equation:

\[ Tracy + Michelle + Katie = 1000 \]

Substituting the expressions for Tracy and Katie in terms of Michelle's driving:

\[ (2M + 20) + M + \frac{M}{3} = 1000 \]

To combine like terms, we need a common denominator for the fractions, which is 3:

\[ (6M + 60) + 3M + M = 3000 \]

\[ 10M + 60 = 3000 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 10M = 2940 \]

Now, divide both sides by 10:

\[ M = 294 \]

So, Michelle drives 300 miles.

Let's denote the number of miles driven by Kati as \( k \). According to the problem, Michelle drives \( 3k \) miles. Tracy drives \( 20 + 2 \times 3k = 20 + 6k \) miles. The total distance driven by all three is 1000 miles, so we can write the equation:

\[ k + 3k + 20 + 6k = 1000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

Therefore, Kati drives 98 miles. Since Michelle drives \( 3 \times k \):

Let's denote the distance driven by Michelle as \( M \). According to the problem, Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives, so the distance driven by Katie is \( \frac{M}{3} \).

Additionally, Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice the distance Michelle drives, so the distance driven by Tracy is \( 2M + 20 \).

The total distance of the trip is 1000 miles, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ M + \frac{M}{3} + (2M + 20) = 1000 \]

Now, we'll solve this equation step by step.

First, find a common denominator to combine the terms:

\[ \frac{3M}{3} + \frac{M}{3} + \frac{6M}{3} + 20 = 1000 \]

Combine the \( M \) terms:

\[ \frac{3M + M + 6M}{3} + 20 = 1000 \]

\[ \frac{10M}{3} + 20 = 1000 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ \frac{10M}{3} = 980 \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator:

\[ 10M = 2940 \]

Now, divide by 10:

\[ M = 294 \]

So, Michelle drives 294 miles.
