To determine how many dollars Leah lost, let's break down the steps:

1. Leah earned $28 from working odd jobs around the neighborhood.
2. She spent a seventh of it on a milkshake, which is \( \frac{1}{7} \times 28 = 4 \) dollars.
3. After spending on the milkshake, she had \( 28 - 4 = 24 \) dollars left.
4. She put half of the remaining amount into her savings account, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \) dollars.
5. Therefore, the amount she kept in her wallet is \( 24 - 12 = 12 \) dollars.
6. Her dog shredded all the money inside the wallet except for $1.
7. She lost \( 12 - 1 = 11 \) dollars.

Leah lost a total of $11.

Reasoning:
1. Leah earned $28 from odd jobs.
2. She spent 1/7th of it on a milkshake, which amounts to: $28 / 7 = $4.
3. The amount remaining after buying the milkshake is: $28 - $4 = $24.
4. She put half of this remaining amount into her savings, which amounts to: $24 / 2 = $12.
5. The amount left after putting half into savings is: $24 - $12 = $12.
6. Her dog shredded all the money except $1, so the total amount lost is: $12 - $1 = $11.

Answer:
Leah lost $11 in total.

To determine how much Leah lost, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Leah spent on the milkshake.
2. Determine how much money was left after buying the milkshake.
3. Calculate how much Leah put in her savings account.
4. Calculate how much money she left in her wallet.
5. Calculate how much money her dog shredded.
6. Subtract the $1 Leah has left from the amount shredded to find out how much she lost in total.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Leah spent a seventh of her $28 on a milkshake:
   \[
   \text{ Amount spent on milkshake} = \frac{1}{7} \times 28 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Subtract the amount spent on the milkshake from the total amount Leah earned:
   \[
   \text{ Amount left after milkshake} = 28 - 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Leah put half of the remaining $24 in her savings account:
   \[
   \text{ Amount put in savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Calculate how much money was left in her wallet:
   \[
   \text{ Amount left in wallet} = 24 - 12 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Leah's dog shredded all but $1 of the remaining money in her wallet, so the amount shredded is:
   \[
   \text{ Amount shredded} = 12 - 1 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. Subtract the $1 Leah has left from the amount shredded to find out how much she lost in total:
   \[
   \text{ Amount lost} = 11 - 1 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Leah lost $10.

To determine how much Leah lost, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Leah earned $28.
2. She spent a seventh of it on a milkshake. The cost of the milkshake is:
   \[
   \frac{28}{7} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The remaining amount after buying the milkshake is:
   \[
   28 - 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Leah put half of the remaining $24 in her savings account. The amount she put in the savings account is:
   \[
   \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. The remaining money after putting $12 in her savings account is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Leah had $12 left before her dog shredded her wallet. After the dog shredded her wallet, she had $1 left.

Therefore, Leah lost:
\[
12 - 1 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

The answer is \(\boxed{11}\).

To determine how much money Leah lost, we need to break down the amounts she spent and how much remained after her dog shredded her wallet.

1. **Amount spent on milkshake:**
   Leah spent a seventh of her $28 on a milkshake.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on milkshake} = \frac{28}{7} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Amount left after buying milkshake:**
   Subtract the milkshake from $28.
   \[
   28 - 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Amount put in savings account:**
   Leah put half of the remaining $24 in her savings account.
   \[
   \text{Amount in savings account} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Amount left in her wallet after putting in savings:**
   Subtract the amount in savings from the remaining $24.
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Amount Leah lost:**
   Her dog shredded all the money in her wallet except $1. The amount lost is the difference between the $1 remaining and the $12 she had left after putting some in savings.
   \[
   \text{Amount lost} = 12 - 1 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Leah lost $11.

To find out how much Leah lost, we can break down her spending into steps:

1. First, Leah spent one seventh of her $28 on a milkshake. The money spent on the milkshake is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{7} \times 28 = \frac{28}{7} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, she had $28 - $4 = $24 left after buying the milkshake.

2. Leah then put half of the remaining $24 into her savings account. The amount put into savings is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   She left the rest of the money in her wallet. So, the money left in her wallet are:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Unfortunately, her dog shredded all the money inside her wallet except $1. So, the amount of money lost is:
   \[
   12 - 1 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Leah lost $11.

To calculate the amount Leah lost, we need to first figure out how much she spent on a milkshake and how much she put in her savings account.

Leah earned $28 and spent a seventh, which is $28 / 7 = $4 on a milkshake.

She had $28 - $4 = $24 left after buying the milkshake. She put half of the remaining money, which is $24 / 2 = $12, into her savings account. The other half, which is also $12, is what she left in her wallet.

Her dog shredded all the money in her wallet except for $1, which means she lost $12 - $1 = $11.

To find out how many dollars Leah lost, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. Leah earned $28.
2. She spent a seventh of it on a milkshake, which is $28 / 7 = $4.
3. After spending the $4, Leah had $28 - $4 = $24 left.

To determine how much money Leah lost, we'll start by calculating the amount she spent on the milkshake and then how much she had left after putting half of the remainder into her savings account. Finally, we'll subtract the $1 her dog shredded from the total.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on the milkshake:**

\[ \text{Amount spent on milkshake} = \frac{1}{7} \times 28 = 4 \]

2. **Calculate the amount left after buying the milkshake:**

\[ \text{Amount left after milkshake} = 28 - 4 = 24 \]

3. **Calculate the amount put into her savings account:**

\[ \text{Amount put into savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \]

4. **Calculate the amount left in her wallet before the dog shredded any money:**

\[ \text{Amount left in wallet before shredding} = 24 - 12 = 12 \]

5. **Since her dog shredded all the money except for $1, the actual amount lost is:**

\[ \text{Amount lost} = 1 \text{ (the remaining $1)} + 12 \text{ (the $1 remaining in her wallet)} = 13 \]

Therefore, Leah lost $13 in total.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Leah earned $28 and spent a seventh of it on a milkshake:
\[ \text{Cost of milkshake} = \frac{1}{7} \times 28 = 4 \]
