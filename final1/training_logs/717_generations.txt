Each smartphone costs $300. A personal computer, which costs $500 more than a smartphone, then costs $300 + $500 = $800. An advanced tablet, which is the sum of the prices of a smartphone and a personal computer, then costs $300 + $800 = $1100. Therefore, the total price to buy one of each of the three products equals $300 + $800 + $1100 = $2200.

To find the total cost of buying one of each product, we first need to calculate the price of each individual product.

The price of a smartphone is $300.
A personal computer is $500 more expensive than a smartphone, so its price is \(300 + 500 = $800\).
An advanced tablet is the sum of the prices of a smartphone and a personal computer, so its price is \(300 + 800 = $1100\).

Now, to find the total cost of buying one of each product, we add the prices of a smartphone, a personal computer, and an advanced tablet together:
\[300 + 800 + 1100 = $2200\]

Therefore, the total cost to buy one of each product is $2200.

To determine the total cost of buying one smartphone, one personal computer, and one advanced tablet, we need to calculate the price of each item first and then sum them up.

1. The price of a smartphone is given as $300.
2. The price of a personal computer is $500 more than a smartphone. Therefore, the price of a personal computer is:
   \[
   300 + 500 = 800
   \]
3. The price of an advanced tablet is the sum of the prices of a smartphone and a personal computer. Therefore, the price of an advanced tablet is:
   \[
   300 + 800 = 1100
   \]

Now, we sum the prices of all three items:
\[
300 + 800 + 1100 = 2200
\]

Thus, the total amount you have to pay to buy one of each of the three mentioned products is $2200.

To determine the total cost of buying one smartphone, one personal computer, and one advanced tablet, let's first calculate the price of each product.

1. **Price of a smartphone**: The price of a smartphone is given as $300.

2. **Price of a personal computer**: The price of a personal computer is $500 more than the price of a smartphone. Therefore, the price of a personal computer is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Price of a personal computer} = \text{Price of a smartphone} + 500
   \]
   Given the price of a smartphone is $300, the price of a personal computer is:
   \[
   300 + 500 = 800
   \]

3. **Price of an advanced tablet**: The advanced tablet is the sum of the prices of a smartphone and a personal computer. Thus, the price of an advanced tablet is:
   \[
   \text{Price of an advanced tablet} = \text{Price of a smartphone} + \text{Price of a personal computer}
   \]
   Since the price of a smartphone is $300 and the price of a personal computer is $800, the price of an advanced tablet is:
   \[
   300 + 800 = 1100
   \]

4. **Total cost**: To find the total cost of buying one of each of these three products, we sum their prices:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price of a smartphone} + \text{Price of a personal computer} + \text{Price of an advanced tablet}
   \]
   Substituting the values we obtained:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 + 800 + 1100
   \]

5. **Final calculation**:
   \[
   300 + 800 + 1100 = 2200
   \]

Thus, the total cost for buying one of each of the three products is $2200.

To determine the total cost of buying one smartphone, one personal computer, and one advanced tablet, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the personal computer.
2. Calculate the price of the advanced tablet.
3. Sum the prices of all three products.

From the given information:
- The price of a smartphone is $300.
- The price of a personal computer is $500 more than the price of a smartphone.

So, the price of a personal computer = $300 + $500 = $800.

Next, the price of an advanced tablet is the sum of the prices of a smartphone and a personal computer:

Price of advanced tablet = $300 + $800 = $1100.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the prices of one smartphone, one personal computer, and one advanced tablet:

Total cost = Price of smartphone + Price of personal computer + Price of advanced tablet
Total cost = $300 + $800 + $1100
Total cost = $2200.

Therefore, the total cost to buy one smartphone, one personal computer, and one advanced tablet is $2200.

To determine the total cost of buying one of each product, we need to calculate the price of each before summing them up.

1. **Smartphones**: The price of a smartphone is given as $300.
2. **Personal Computers**: These are priced $500 more than smartphones. Therefore, the price for a personal computer is $300 + $500.
3. **Advanced Tablets**: These are priced the sum of the prices of a smartphone and a personal computer, so the advanced tablet price is ($300 + $500) + $300.

Let's calculate the prices:

- **Price of a smartphone**: $300.
- **Price of a personal computer**: $300 + $500 = $800.
- **Price of an advanced tablet**: ($300 + $500) + $300 = $800 + $300 = $1100.

Now, sum up the prices of all three products:
- Total cost = Price of smartphone + Price of personal computer + Price of advanced tablet.
- Total cost = $300 + $800 + $1100 = $2200.

Therefore, to buy one of each product, you have to pay **$2200** in total.

Let's denote the price of a smartphone as \( S \). From the problem, we know:

- A smartphone costs $300.
- A personal computer costs $500 more than a smartphone, so its price is \( S + 500 \).
- An advanced tablet costs the sum of the prices of a smartphone and a personal computer, so its price is \( S + (S + 500) = 2S + 500 \).

To calculate the total cost of buying one of each product, we add the prices of a smartphone, a personal computer, and an advanced tablet:

- Price of a smartphone: $300
- Price of a personal computer: \( S + 500 \)
- Price of an advanced tablet: \( 2S + 500 \)

The total cost \( T \) can be expressed as:

\[ T = S + (S + 500) + (2S + 500) \]

Combining like terms:

\[ T = S + S + 500 + 2S + 500 \]
\[ T = 4S + 1000 \]

Substituting \( S \) with the value of the smartphone price:

\[ T = 4 \times 300 + 1000 \]
\[ T = 1200 + 1000 \]
\[ T = 2200 \]

Therefore, the total cost to buy one of each product is $2200.
