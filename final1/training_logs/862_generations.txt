###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Jake is retrieving the notes on a communal board, putting all of the red notes in the complaints bin and all of the blue notes in the compliments bin. The red notes were in 5 rows with 6 notes in each row. There are 2 blue notes under each of the red notes, as well as another 10 blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board. How many notes in total are put into the complaints and compliments bins?

To determine the total number of notes put into the complaints and compliments bins, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Red Notes**:
   - Joe counted the red notes arranged in 5 rows with 6 notes in each row.
   - The total number of red notes is \( 5 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ notes per row} = 30 \text{ red notes} \).
   - Since each red note is placed under a blue note, and there are 2 blue notes under each red note, the total number of blue notes corresponding to the red notes would be \( 30 \text{ red notes} \times 2 \text{ blue notes per red note} = 60 \text{ blue notes} \).
   - Additionally, there are 10 blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board.
   - Therefore, the total number of blue notes is \( 60 + 10 = 70 \text{ blue notes} \).

2. **Compliments Bin**: All of these 70 blue notes would be put into the compliments bin.

3. **Complaints Bin**: Since all 30 red notes have their blue notes already placed in the compliments bin, they will not be put into the complaints bin.

4. **Total Notes**: The total number of notes put into the complaints and compliments bins is the total number of blue notes, which is 70.

To determine the total number of notes Jake retrieves, we need to consider both the red and blue notes.

First, let's calculate the number of red notes:
- Each row has 6 red notes.
- There are 5 rows of red notes.

Number of red notes = 5 rows * 6 notes/row = 30 red notes.

Next, we calculate the number of blue notes:
- Jake finds blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board, which are 2 blue notes under each of the 30 red notes.

Number of blue notes = 30 red notes * 2 blue notes/row = 60 blue notes.

Additionally, there are extra blue notes found under the red notes:
Number of extra blue notes = 2 blue notes

Total number of blue notes = 60 blue notes + 2 blue notes = 62 blue notes.

Now, we add the total number of red and blue notes:
Total number of notes = Red notes + Blue notes = 30 red notes + 62 blue notes = 92 notes.

Therefore, Jake retrieves a total of 92 notes into the complaints and compliments bins.

First, we need to determine the total number of red notes. There are 5 rows with 6 notes in each row, so the total number of red notes is \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) notes.

Next, we need to calculate the number of blue notes. There are 2 blue notes under each of the red notes, so there are \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) blue notes under the red notes. Additionally, there are 10 more blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board. So, the total number of blue notes is \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) notes.

Finally, to find the total number of notes put into the complaints and compliments bins, we simply add the number of red notes and blue notes: \( 30 + 70 = 100 \) notes.

The red notes are put in the complaints bin, so there are 30 red notes in the complaints bin. The blue notes, which come in the total number of blue notes put in the complements bin, is 70.

So, in total, there are 30 red notes and 70 blue notes, which is \( 30 + 70 = 100 \) notes in total.

To determine the total number of notes Jake retrieves from the communal board and puts in the complaints and compliments bins, we need to calculate the number of red notes and the number of blue notes separately.

1. First, calculate the number of red notes:
   - There are 5 rows of red notes with 6 notes in each row.
   - Number of red notes = \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) notes.

2. Next, calculate the number of blue notes:
   - Under each row of red notes, there are 2 blue notes.
   - Therefore, the total number of blue notes under the red notes is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) notes.
   - Additionally, there are 10 more blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board.
   - Total number of blue notes = \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) notes.

3. Finally, add the number of red notes and blue notes to find the total number of notes:
   - Total number of notes = \( 30 \) (red notes) + \( 20 \) (blue notes) = \( 50 \) notes.

So, Jake retrieves a total of \( 50 \) notes from the communal board and puts them in the complaints and compliments bins.

   - Total red notes = 5 rows × 6 notes/row = 30 red notes.

2. Blue Notes:
   - Under each red note (which are all red notes), there are 2 blue notes.
   - Total blue notes due to red notes = 30 red notes × 2 blue notes/red note = 60 blue notes.
   
   + There are 10 blue notes scattered under the board.

To determine the total number of notes, we need to calculate the number of red notes and add it to the number of blue notes.

1. **Red notes calculation:**
   - There are 5 rows with 6 notes in each row.
   - Total red notes = 5 rows * 6 notes/row = 30 notes

2. **Blue notes calculation:**
   - There are 2 blue notes under each red note.
   - Total blue notes under red notes = 30 red notes * 2 notes/red = 60 notes
   - Additionally, there are 10 blue notes scattered at the bottom.

   Adding these together:
   - Total blue notes = 60 notes + 10 notes = 70 notes

3. **Total notes:**
   - Total notes = Red notes + Blue notes = 30 + 70 = 100 notes

4. Jake places all red notes in the complaints bin and all blue notes in the compliments bin.
   - Therefore, Jake puts 30 red notes in the complaints bin and 70 blue notes in the compliments bin.

   Adding these together to find the total notes in terms of placement:
   - Total notes in complaints bin = 30 notes
   - Total notes in compliments bin = 70 notes

Now, let's add both bins together:
   - Total notes in complaints + compliments bin = 30 + 70 = 100 notes
