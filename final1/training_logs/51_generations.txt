###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Ann is cutting fabric to make curtains. She cuts a 4 foot by 6 foot rectangle for the living room, and a 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle for the bedroom. If the bolt of fabric is 16 feet by 12 feet, how much fabric is left in square feet?

To determine how much fabric is left, we need to calculate the total amount of fabric used for the curtains and subtract it from the total amount of fabric available on the bolt.

First, calculate the area of the fabric used for the living room curtains:
\[ \text{Area of living room curtains} = 4 \text{ feet} \times 6 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, calculate the area of the fabric used for the bedroom curtains:
\[ \text{Area of bedroom curtains} = 2 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, find the total area of fabric used:
\[ \text{Total area used} = 24 \text{ square feet} + 8 \text{ square feet} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

The bolt of fabric is 16 feet by 12 feet, so the total area of the bolt is:
\[ \text{Total area of the bolt} = 16 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 192 \text{ square feet} \]

To find out how much fabric is left, subtract the total area used from the total area of the bolt:
\[ \text{Fabric left} = 192 \text{ square feet} - 32 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the amount of fabric left is \( \boxed{160} \) square feet.

To determine how much fabric is left, we first need to calculate the total area of the fabric and then the total area used for the curtains.

The total area of the fabric bolt is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total area} = 16 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 192 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the fabric used for the living room curtains:
\[ \text{Area for living room curtains} = 4 \text{ feet} \times 6 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Then, we calculate the area of the fabric used for the bedroom curtains:
\[ \text{Area for bedroom curtains} = 2 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we find the total area used by adding the areas for the living room and bedroom curtains:
\[ \text{Total area used} = 24 \text{ square feet} + 8 \text{ square feet} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

Finally, we subtract the total area used from the total area of the fabric bolt to find the amount of fabric left:
\[ \text{Fabric left} = 192 \text{ square feet} - 32 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the amount of fabric left is 160 square feet.

First, we calculate the total area of the fabric Ann used for the curtains. For the living room, the area is 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet. For the bedroom, the area is 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet. The total area used is 24 square feet + 8 square feet = 32 square feet.

Next, we calculate the area of the original bolt of fabric. The area is 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet.

Finally, we subtract the area used from the original area to find the amount of fabric left: 192 square feet - 32 square feet = 160 square feet.

Therefore, the answer is 160 square feet.

The living room curtain takes up an area of 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet. The bedroom curtain takes up an area of 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet. The total area taken up by the two curtains is 24 square feet + 8 square feet = 32 square feet. The area of the bolt is 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet. Therefore, Ann has 192 square feet - 32 square feet = 160 square feet of fabric left.

To determine how much fabric is left after Ann cuts the rectangles, we need to calculate the total area of the fabric and the total area of the rectangles she cut.

First, let's calculate the area of the fabric bolt:
\[
\text{Area of the bolt} = 16 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 192 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of the rectangular piece for the living room:
\[
\text{Area of the living room piece} = 4 \text{ feet} \times 6 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ square feet}
\]

Then, let's calculate the area of the rectangular piece for the bedroom:
\[
\text{Area of the bedroom piece} = 2 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ square feet}
\]

Now, we add the areas of both pieces to find the total area of fabric used:
\[
\text{Total area used} = 24 \text{ square feet} + 8 \text{ square feet} = 32 \text{ square feet}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total area used from the area of the bolt to find the remaining fabric:
\[
\text{Remaining fabric} = 192 \text{ square feet} - 32 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the amount of fabric left is:
\[
\boxed{160 \text{ square feet}}
\]

In order to calculate the amount of fabric remaining, we need to subtract the total fabric used for the curtains from the total fabric available. 

First, let's calculate the total area of the fabric used for the curtains:

For the living room:
- 4-foot by 6-foot rectangle
Total area = 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet

For the bedroom:
- 2-foot by 4-foot rectangle
Total area = 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet

Now, let's add the two areas together to get the total fabric used:

Total fabric used = 24 square feet + 8 square feet = 32 square feet

Now we need to calculate the total area of the bolt of fabric:
- 16 feet by 12 feet
Total area = 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet

Finally, let's calculate the remaining fabric:

Remaining fabric = Total area of the bolt - Total fabric used
Remaining fabric = 192 square feet - 32 square feet = 160 square feet

Therefore, the answer is 160 square feet.

To find out how much fabric Ann has left, we need to calculate the total area of the fabric she used and subtract it from the total area of the bolt of fabric.

First, let's calculate the area of the fabric used for both rooms.

For the living room:
Area = length × width
     = 4 feet × 6 feet
     = 24 square feet

For the bedroom:
Area = length × width
     = 2 feet × 4 feet
     = 8 square feet

Now, let's calculate the total area used for both rooms:
Total area used = area for living room + area for bedroom
                = 24 square feet + 8 square feet
                = 32 square feet

Next, let's calculate the total area of the bolt of fabric:
Total area of the bolt = length × width
                      = 16 feet × 12 feet
                      = 192 square feet

Finally, let's find out how much fabric is left:
Fabric left = total area of the bolt - total area used
            = 192 square feet - 32 square feet
            = 160 square feet

Therefore, there is 160 square feet of fabric left.

To find out how much fabric is left after Ann cuts the rectangles, we first need to calculate the original area of the bolt of fabric and then subtract the areas of the two rectangles that were cut off.

The original area of the bolt of fabric is:

The area of the rectangle for the bedroom is:
\[2 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ square feet}\]

The total area of the fabric used is the sum of the areas of the two rectangles:
\[24 \text{ square feet} + 8 \text{ square feet} = 32 \text{ square feet}\]

Finally, to find out how much fabric is left, we subtract the area used from the original area:

And if Ann decides to make 2 more curtains for the hallway using the same fabric pattern, how much total fabric will be used?
...
</reasoning>
<answer>
To determine how much fabric is left, we first need to calculate the total amount of fabric used for the curtains for the living room and the bedroom.

The fabric used for the living room curtains is \(4 \text{ feet} \times 6 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ square feet}\).
The fabric used for the bedroom curtains is \(2 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ square feet}\).

The total fabric used for the living room and bedroom curtains is \(24 \text{ square feet} + 8 \text{ square feet} = 32 \text{ square feet}\).

The bolt of fabric is \(16 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 192 \text{ square feet}\).

Therefore, the amount of fabric left is \(192 \text{ square feet} - 32 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}\).

If Ann decides to make 2 more curtains for the hallway using the same fabric pattern, the total fabric used for the 3 sets of curtains is \(32 \text{ square feet} \times 3 = 96 \text{ square feet}\).

The amount of fabric used is \(96 \text{ square feet}\).

Therefore, the amount of fabric total fabric that is used to make the 3 curtains is \(96 \text{ square feet}\).
