<reasoning>
To determine how many seconds remained for the french fries to be fully cooked, we need to compare the recommended cooking time with the actual cooking time. The recommended cooking time is 5 minutes, and the actual cooking time is 45 seconds.

First, we need to convert the recommended cooking time from minutes to seconds:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we subtract the actual cooking time from the recommended cooking time:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} - 45 \text{ seconds} = 255 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the number of seconds remaining for the french fries to be fully cooked is:
\[ 255 \text{ seconds} \]

To determine how many seconds remain for the french fries to be fully cooked, we need to subtract the time Bill already put them in the oven from the recommended cooking time.

The recommended cooking time is 5 minutes. First, we convert this time into seconds:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} = 5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Bill put the french fries in the oven for 45 seconds. Now, we subtract this time from the recommended cooking time:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} - 45 \text{ seconds} = 255 \text{ seconds} \]

So, 255 seconds remain for the french fries to be fully cooked.

To find out how many seconds remained, we need to subtract the time Bill actually put the fries in the oven from the recommended time.

Recommended time = 5 minutes = 5 Ã— 60 seconds = 300 seconds
Actual time = 45 seconds

Remaining time = Recommended time - Actual time
Remaining time = 300 seconds - 45 seconds
Remaining time = 255 seconds

So, 255 seconds remained after Bill put the fries in the oven.

Bill put his french fries in for 45 seconds. The recommended time for fully cooked fries is 5 minutes, which is equivalent to 300 seconds (since 1 minute = 60 seconds). Therefore, the time remaining is 300 seconds - 45 seconds = 255 seconds.

First, let's convert the recommended cooking time into seconds for consistency. The recommended time is 5 minutes. Since 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, 5 minutes is equal to \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \) seconds.

Bill put the French fries in the oven for 45 seconds. To find out how many seconds remained, we subtract the time Bill already spent from the recommended cooking time:

\( 300 \text{ seconds} - 45 \text{ seconds} = 255 \text{ seconds} \).

So, there are 255 seconds remaining for the French fries to be fully cooked.

First, we need to determine the total recommended cooking time in seconds. Since the recommended time was 5 minutes, we convert this into seconds by multiplying 5 by 60:

$$ 
5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 300 \text{ seconds} 
$$

Bill actually put the fries in for 45 seconds. To find out how many seconds remained, we subtract the actual cooking time from the recommended cooking time:

$$ 
300 \text{ seconds} - 45 \text{ seconds} = 255 \text{ seconds}

First, we need to understand that the recommended cooking time is 5 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the recommended cooking time in seconds is calculated as \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \) seconds. Bill put the fries in the oven for 45 seconds. To find out how many seconds remain, we subtract the time he used from the recommended time: \( 300 - 45 = 255 \) seconds.

Bill put the french fries in for 45 seconds. The recommended time for them to be fully cooked is 5 minutes. First, we need to convert the recommended time into seconds. Since 1 minute equals 60 seconds, 5 minutes is equal to \(5 \times 60 = 300\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the difference between the recommended time and the time Bill actually put the fries in. The recommended time was 300 seconds, and Bill put them in for 45 seconds, so the remaining time is \(300 - 45 = 255\) seconds.

Therefore, 255 seconds remain after Bill put the fries in.

To find the remaining cooking time, we first need to convert the recommended cooking time into seconds, so we multiply the minutes by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). Therefore, the recommended cooking time in seconds is 5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds.

Bill actually cooked his french fries for 45 seconds. To find the remaining cooking time, we subtract the actual cooking time from the recommended cooking time. This is 300 seconds - 45 seconds = 255 seconds.

So, there are 255 seconds remaining for the french fries to be fully cooked.
