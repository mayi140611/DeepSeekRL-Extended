###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

The batting cage sells golf balls by the dozen. They charge $30 for 3 dozen. Dan buys 5 dozen, Gus buys 2 dozen, and Chris buys 48 golf balls. How many golf balls do they purchase in total, assuming 12 golf balls are 1 dozen?

system
To find the total number of golf balls purchased, we first need to calculate the number of dozens each person buys and then convert those into individual golf balls.

1. Dan buys 5 dozen golf balls. This means he buys \(5 \times 12 = 60\) golf balls.
2. Gus buys 2 dozen golf balls. This means he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) golf balls.
3. Chris buys 48 golf balls. This means he buys \(48 \div 12 = 4\) dozens.

Now, we add up all the individual golf balls:
- Dan's golf balls: 60
- Gus's golf balls: 24
- Chris's golf balls: 48

So the total number of golf balls purchased is \(60 + 24 + 48 = 132\).

To find the total number of golf balls purchased, we first need to calculate how many dozens each person buys and then convert those dozens into golf balls.

Dan buys 5 dozen: \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) golf balls.
Gus buys 2 dozen: \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) golf balls.
Chris buys 48 golf balls.

Next, we sum the golf balls bought by each person:

\( 60 \text{ (Dan)} + 24 \text{ (Gus)} + 48 \text{ (Chris)} = 132 \text{ golf balls} \)

Therefore, the total number of golf balls purchased is 132.

To determine the total number of golf balls purchased, we need to first calculate how many dozens each customer buys and then convert these dozens into the total number of golf balls.

1. **Dan's purchase:**
   Dan buys 5 dozen.
   - Total golf balls from Dan: \(5 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ balls/dozen} = 60 \text{ balls}\).

2. **Gus's purchase:**
   Gus buys 2 dozen.
   - Total golf balls from Gus: \(2 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ balls/dozen} = 24 \text{ balls}\).

3. **Chris's purchase:**
   Chris buys 48 golf balls. Since 1 dozen equals 12 golf balls, we calculate the total dozen from Chris:
   - \( \frac{48 \text{ balls}}{12 \text{ balls/dozen}} = 4 \text{ dozen} \).
   - Total golf balls from Chris: \(4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ balls/dozen} = 48 \text{ balls}\).

4. **Total golf balls purchased:**
   - Sum of all golf balls:
     \(60 \text{ balls} + 24 \text{ balls} + 48 \text{ balls} = 132 \text{ balls}\).

Therefore, the total number of golf balls purchased is 132.

- Gus buys 2 dozen, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) golf balls.

To find the total number of golf balls purchased, we need to calculate the number of golf balls each person bought and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of golf balls Dan bought:
- Dan buys 5 dozen golf balls.
- Since 1 dozen = 12 golf balls, we have \(5 \times 12 = 60\) golf balls for Dan.

Next, let's calculate the number of golf balls Gus bought:
- Gus buys 2 dozen golf balls.
- So, \(2 \times 12 = 24\) golf balls for Gus.

Now, let's calculate the number of golf balls Chris bought:
- Chris buys 48 golf balls directly, which is already in dozens, so no conversion is needed.

Now, let's sum up all the golf balls purchased:
- Dan's golf balls: 60
- Gus's golf balls: 24
- Chris's golf balls: 48
- Total: \(60 + 24 + 48 = 132\)

Therefore, they purchase a total of 132 golf balls.

First, we determine the cost per dozen golf balls. Given the pricing structure of $30 for 3 dozen, the cost per dozen is:

\[ \text{Cost per dozen} = \frac{30}{3} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of dozen golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris.

Dan buys 5 dozen golf balls:
\[ 5 \text{ dozen} \times 10 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Gus buys 2 dozen golf balls:
\[ 2 \text{ dozen} \times 10 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Chris buys 48 golf balls, and since 1 dozen is 12 golf balls, we convert 48 golf balls to dozens:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ golf balls}}{12 \text{ golf balls/dozen}} = 4 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the dozens purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris, and then add the cost for the remaining golf balls.

Dan's cost for his 5 dozen: 50 dollars
Gus' cost for his 2 dozen: 20 dollars
Chris' cost for 4 dozen: 40 dollars

Total cost for the dozens:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} + 20 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Dan originally bought 5 dozen, there are no golf balls left over, and Chris's purchase does not affect the total cost calculation for the dozens.

Finally, we sum up the total number of golf balls purchased:
\[ 5 \text{ dozen} + 2 \text{ dozen} + 4 \text{ dozen} = 11 \text{ dozen} \]
\[ 11 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ golf balls/dozen} = 132 \text{ golf balls} \]

Thus, the total number of golf balls purchased is:

Now, let's add up all the golf balls:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris. We know that they all pay for 12 golf balls (1 dozen).

First, let's calculate the number of golf balls per dozen:
\[ 12 \text{ golf balls} \]

Next, we'll determine how many dozens each person buys and then convert those quantities into the number of golf balls.

1. **Dan buys 5 dozen:**
   \[
   5 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ golf balls/dozen} = 60 \text{ golf balls}
   \]

2. **Gus buys 2 dozen:**
   \[
   2 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ golf balls/dozen} = 24 \text{ golf balls}
   \]

3. **Chris buys 48 golf balls directly:**
   \[
   48 \text{ golf balls}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the golf balls purchased:
\[
60 \text{ golf balls (Dan)} + 24 \text{ golf balls (Gus)} + 48 \text{ golf balls (Chris)} = 132 \text{ golf balls}
\]

Thus, the total number of golf balls purchased is:
\[

First, we calculate the cost for Dan's purchase:
- Dan buys 5 dozen and the price is $30 for 3 dozen, so the cost for 5 dozen is $\frac{5}{3} \times 30 = 50$ dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost for Gus's purchase:
- Gus buys 2 dozen, so the cost for 2 dozen is $\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20$ dollars.

Lastly, we convert Chris's purchase from balls to dozens:
- Since Chris buys 48 golf balls and 1 dozen is 12 golf balls, he buys $\frac{48}{12} = 4$ dozens.

Now, we sum up the total cost for all three purchases:
- Dan's purchase: 50 dollars
- Gus's purchase: 20 dollars
- Chris's purchase: 50 dollars (as it's 4 dozens at $30)
- Total: 50 + 20 + 50 = 120 dollars.

To find the total number of golf balls purchased:
- Dan buys 5 dozen, which is $5 \times 12 = 60$ golf balls.
- Gus buys 2 dozen, which is $2 \times 12 = 24$ golf balls.
- Chris buys 4 dozens, which is $4 \times 12 = 48$ golf balls.

First, let's calculate the total number of dozen golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris.

Dan buys 5 dozen.
Gus buys 2 dozen.
Chris buys 48 golf balls, which is equivalent to 48 / 12 = 4 dozen.

Now, let's add these up to find the total number of dozen golf balls:
5 dozen (Dan) + 2 dozen (Gus) + 4 dozen (Chris) = 11 dozen

Next, we calculate the total cost based on the given pricing:

The pricing is $30 for 3 dozen, which means each dozen costs:
$30 / 3 dozen = $10 per dozen

Now, let's calculate the cost:
Total dozen golf balls purchased = 11 dozen
Cost per dozen = $10

Total cost = 11 dozen * $10 per dozen = $110

So, they purchase a total of 11 dozen golf balls for $110.
