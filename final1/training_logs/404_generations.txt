To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, we need to calculate the space taken up by each boat, the distance between boats, and the distance to the riverbank.

Each boat takes up 3 feet for its width. The distance between boats is 2 feet. The distance to the riverbank is also 2 feet.

First, calculate the total space taken up by one boat and its immediate neighbors (one boat and the two spaces between them):
\[ 3 \text{ feet (boat)} + 2 \text{ feet (between)} + 2 \text{ feet (boat)} = 7 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we subtract the total space taken up by one boat and its immediate neighbors from the total width of the river to find out how much space is left for other boats:
\[ 42 \text{ feet} - 7 \text{ feet} = 35 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find out how many boats can fit into the remaining 35 feet, we divide the remaining space by the space each boat takes up:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ feet}}{7 \text{ feet/boat}} = 5 \text{ boats} \]

So, 5 boats can race in the river.

To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, with each boat being 3 feet across and needing at least 2 feet between them or the riverbank, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Each boat occupies 3 feet of the river.
2. The space required to maintain 2 feet between any two boats is 2 feet (gap between the first and second boat) + 2 feet (gap between the second and third boat) + ... = 2n feet, where n is the number of boats.

So, for n boats, the total length occupied by the boats and the gaps between them is the sum of the lengths of the boats plus the gaps:
\[ 3n + 2(0 + 1 + 2 + \ldots + (n-1)) \]

The sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \]

Thus, the total length for n boats is:
\[ 3n + 2 \times \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 3n + (n-1)n = 3n + n^2 - n = n^2 + 2n \]

We need this total length to be less than or equal to the length of the river:
\[ n^2 + 2n \leq 42 \]

To find the maximum number of boats, we solve the quadratic inequality by first solving the equation:
\[ n^2 + 2n - 42 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -42 \):
\[ n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 168}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{172}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{43}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{43} \]
\[ n = -1 + \sqrt{43} \]

Since \(\sqrt{43} \approx 6.56\), we have:
\[ n \approx -1 + 6.56 = 5.56 \]

So, the maximum integer value of \( n \) that satisfies the inequality is 5.

Let's verify this by calculating the total length for \( n = 5 \):
\[ 5^2 + 2 \times 5 = 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ feet} \]
This is less than 42 feet, so 5 boats are possible.

For \( n = 6 \):
\[ 6^2 + 2 \times 6 = 36 + 12 = 48 \text{ feet} \]
This is more than 42 feet, so 6 boats are not possible.

Therefore, the maximum number of boats that can race in the river is 5.

To determine how many boats can race in a 42-foot river, we need to consider both the width of the boats and the minimum width required for the gaps between them and the riverbank.

Each boat is 3 feet wide. The minimum gap between boats must be 2 feet. Let's calculate how many boats can fit in one segment of the river, which is the sum of the width of one boat and the minimum gap between boats:

3 feet (boat) + 2 feet (gap) = 5 feet per segment

Next, we divide the total width of the river by the width of each boat and the minimum gap:

42 feet / 5 feet per segment = 8.4 segments

Since we cannot have a fraction of a segment, we can fit 8 complete segments, and we need to subtract the width of one boat to account for the boat that is placed last:

8 segments * 5 feet per segment = 40 feet (width of 8 boats)
40 feet - 3 feet (width of last boat) = 37 feet remaining

So, we can fit 8 boats per segment, and we have 37 feet remaining. Since 37 feet is less than 5 feet per segment, we can place the last boat in its corresponding segment without exceeding the river's width.

Therefore, we can fit:
8 segments * 8 boats per segment = 64 boats total

To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, we need to consider both the width of each boat and the space required for the gaps between boats and the riverbank. Each boat is 3 feet across, and there needs to be at least 2 feet between each boat and 2 feet between the last boat and the riverbank. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Each boat needs 3 feet of space for itself.
2. There needs to be 2 feet of space between each boat and the next boat.
3. There needs to be 2 feet of space between the last boat and the riverbank.

If we denote the number of boats as \( n \), then the total width required for \( n \) boats is:
\[ 3n + (n-1) \times 2 + 2 \]

We need this total width to be less than or equal to 42 feet. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
\[ 3n + 2(n-1) + 2 \leq 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3n + 2n - 2 + 2 \leq 42 \]
\[ 5n \leq 42 \]
\[ n \leq \frac{42}{5} \]
\[ n \leq 8.4 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the maximum number of boats that can race is 8.

To verify, if we have 8 boats, the space required is:
\[ 3 \times 8 + (8-1) \times 2 + 2 = 24 + 14 + 2 = 40 \]
This is within the 42 feet of the river.

If we have 9 boats, the space required is:
\[ 3 \times 9 + (9-1) \times 2 + 2 = 27 + 16 + 2 = 45 \]
This exceeds the 42 feet of the river.

Therefore, the maximum number of boats that can race is 8.

To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, given that each boat is 3 feet across and there must be at least 2 feet between them or the riverbank, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total space required for one boat and the space before it (2 feet):
   - One boat: 3 feet (boat length) + 2 feet (space) = 5 feet.

2. Determine how many boats can fit in the 42-foot length of the river by dividing the total length of the river by the space required for one boat and the space before it:
   - \(42 \div 5 = 8\) remainder \(2\).

3. The quotient gives us the number of full boats that can fit, and the remainder indicates the additional space left after placing 8 full boats.

4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a boat and we have 2 extra feet (which can accommodate one additional boat), we can fit 8 full boats plus 1 remainder boat.

5. Adding the extra boat to the 8 full boats gives us a total of 9 boats.

Therefore, the number of boats that can race in a river that is 42 feet across, given the constraints, is 9.

To find out how many boats can race in the river, we first need to determine the total width occupied by each boat and the space between boats. Each boat is 3 feet across, so that's 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 feet per boat and space combo (boat + 2 feet + boat). 

With a total river width of 42 feet, we divide the total width by the width occupied by each combination to find out how many boats can fit:

\[ \text{Number of Boats} = \frac{\text{Total Width of River}}{\text{Width of Each Boat and Space Combo}} \]

\[ \text{Number of Boats} = \frac{42}{8} \]

\[ \text{Number of Boats} = 5.25 \]

Since you can't have a fraction of a boat, you can only fit 5 full boats in the river (because you can't have a 2.25 boat, which is essentially half a boat with no space following it, or more than a complete boat without a space following).

So, <answer>5</answer> boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across.

To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across with each boat being 3 feet wide and at least 2 feet of space between each boat or the riverbank, we need to consider the total space required for the boats and the space between them.

First, we need to determine how many 3-foot wide sections can fit into a 42-foot wide river. This is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{42 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/boat}} = 14 \text{ boats}
\]

Now, in addition to the 3-foot sections for the boats, we also need to consider the space required for the 2-foot gap between each boat. Since there are 14 boats, we will have 13 gaps between them. However, we need to remember that the first boat does not require a gap before it, so we will have 12 gaps to consider.

\[
14 \text{ boats} + 12 \text{ gaps} = 26 \text{ sections}
\]

Since each section is 3 feet wide, we can fit 14 boats in the river with a 2-foot gap between them.

To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, given that each boat is 3 feet across and there must be at least 2 feet between boats or the riverbank, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the space required for a single boat and the gap before and after it:**
   - Each boat is 3 feet long.
   - There should be 2 feet between the boat and the adjacent boat or the riverbank.
   - So, the total space required for a single boat and the required gap is:
     \[
     3 + 2 + 3 = 8 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine how many boats can fit within 42 feet:**
   - We need to divide the total width of the river by the space required per boat:
     \[
     \frac{42}{8} = 5.25
     \]

3. **Round down to the nearest whole number:**
   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a boat, we round 5.25 down to 5.

So, the number of boats that can race in a river that is 42 feet across is 5.

To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, with each boat being 3 feet across and needing at least 2 feet of space between them or the riverbank, we need to calculate the total space required and then subtract the space occupied by the boats from the total length of the river.

1. The total length of the river is 42 feet.
2. Each boat takes up 3 feet, and there should be 2 feet of space between any two boats and between the boats and the riverbank.

So, the total space required for each row of boats and the spaces between them is:
\[3 \text{ feet (boat)} + 2 \text{ feet (space between boats)} + 3 \text{ feet (boat)} = 8 \text{ feet per row}\]

3. To find out how many such rows fit in the river, we divide the total length of the river by the space required for each row:
\[42 \text{ feet} \div 8 \text{ feet per row} = 5.25 \text{ rows}\]

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we take the integer part of the division:
\[5.25 \text{ rows} \approx 5 \text{ rows}\]

4. Now, we need to check if 5 boats can fit in 5 rows. If there is not enough space for the 6th boat to fit without the riverbank or another boat, we need to reduce the number of rows by one.

5. Calculate the total space occupied by 5 boats:
\[5 \text{ boats} \times 3 \text{ feet/boat} = 15 \text{ feet}\]

6. Calculate the remaining space:
\[42 \text{ feet} - 15 \text{ feet} = 27 \text{ feet}\]

Since 27 feet is more than enough to accommodate the 6th boat with 2 feet of space between them and the riverbank, we can indeed fit one more row.

7. Therefore, the total number of rows is:
\[5 \text{ rows (initial)} + 1 \text{ row (additional)} = 6 \text{ rows}\]

8. Finally, calculate the total number of boats that can race:
\[6 \text{ rows} \times 5 \text{ boats per row} = 30 \text{ boats}\]

So, the total number of boats that can race in the river is:
\[30 \text{ boats}\]

To determine how many boats can race, we need to account for the space required for each boat and the distance between boats or the riverbank. Each boat is 3 feet across, and the minimum space required (including the space between boats) is 3 feet (for the boat) + 2 feet (for the space between boats) = 5 feet per set of one boat and one space.

Now, let's divide the total width of the river by the space required per set:

\[ \text{Number of sets} = \frac{\text{Total width of the river}}{\text{Space per set}} = \frac{42 \text{ feet}}{5 \text{ feet/set}} = 8.4 \]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a set, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, we can have 8 sets.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boats:

\[ \text{Number of boats} = \text{Number of sets} \times \text{Boats per set} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, we need to account for the width of each boat and the minimum distance required between them or the riverbank. Each boat takes up 3 feet and must have at least 2 feet between each boat or the riverbank.

We can calculate the available space per boat and then divide the total width of the river by this space.

\[
\text{Space per boat with a 2-foot gap} = 3 \text{ feet (boat)} + 2 \text{ feet (gap)} = 5 \text{ feet}
\]

\[
\text{Number of boats = } \frac{\text{Total width of the river}}{\text{Space per boat}} = \frac{42 \text{ feet}}{5 \text{ feet per boat}} = 8 \text{ boats with 2 feet gap}
\]

Since leaving a 2-foot gap between each boat is required, we account for this as well. Even though the calculation gives us exactly 8 boats because the remaining space is not enough to accommodate another boat without violating the 2-foot gap rule, we need to ensure the configuration adheres to this rule. A practical configuration would be to place the boats with 2 feet of space between them, and the remaining spaces would be filled with boats only if they fit within the given dimensions.

Therefore, the configuration with the required 2-foot gap allows exactly 8 boats to race.

We need to determine how many 3-foot-wide boats, surrounded by 2 feet of space, can fit into a river that is 42 feet across.

First, we account for the 2 feet between each boat and the riverbanks. Since the river is 42 feet wide, we deduct 2 feet from both ends:
\[ 42 - 2 - 2 = 38 \text{ feet} \]

The remaining 38 feet can be divided by the 3 feet each boat takes up:
\[ \frac{38}{3} = 12 \text{ with a remainder of } 2 \]

This means 12 full boats can be accommodated, but we have a remainder of 2 feet which is not enough to allow a boat to fit without violating the space requirements.

To determine how many boats can race in the river, we need to consider the total length of the river that can be occupied by the boats and the gaps between them. The boats occupy 3 feet each, and there must be at least 2 feet between each boat and the riverbank.

First, we calculate the total space occupied by the boats and the gaps. If we have $n$ boats, then we need $n-1$ gaps between the boats. Therefore, the total space is:
\[ 3n + 2(n-1) = 3n + 2n - 2 = 5n - 2 \]
This must be less than or equal to the total length of the river, which is 42 feet. So, we set up the inequality:
\[ 5n - 2 \leq 42 \]
Adding 2 to both sides of the inequality, we get:
\[ 5n \leq 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
\[ n \leq \frac{44}{5} = 8.8 \]
Since $n$ must be a whole number, the maximum number of boats that can race is 8.

To verify, if we have 8 boats, the total space occupied will be:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 7 = 24 + 14 = 38 \text{ feet} \]
This is within the 42 feet of the river, so 8 boats can race in the river.
