#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

Let's denote the cost of each candy bar as \( x \).

Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each, so the total cost for the soft drinks is \( 2 \times 4 = \$8 \).

He also bought 5 candy bars, and the total cost for the candy bars is \( 5 \times x \).

The total amount he spent is $28, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + 5x = 28 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5x = 28 - 8 \]
\[ 5x = 20 \]

Now, divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, each candy bar cost $4.

Let's calculate this step by step.

First, we know the total amount spent by Benny is $28 and he bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each. The cost of these soft drinks would be:

2 soft drinks * $4/soft drink = $8

So, the amount spent on candy bars is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on soft drinks:

$28 (total) - $8 (soft drinks) = $20

Benny bought 5 candy bars and spent $20 on them. To find the cost of each candy bar, we divide the total cost of candy bars by the number of candy bars:

$20 (total cost of candy bars) / 5 (candy bars) = $4/candy bar

Let's denote the cost of each candy bar as \( x \) dollars.

From the information given:
- Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each, so the cost of the soft drinks is \( 2 \times $4 = $8 \).
- He also bought 5 candy bars, so the total cost for the candy bars is \( 5 \times x \).
- The total amount he spent is $28.

We can set up the equation:

\( 8 + 5x = 28 \)

Now let's solve for \( x \):

\( 5x = 28 - 8 \)

\( 5x = 20 \)

\( x = \frac{20}{5} \)

\( x = 4 \)

So each candy bar costs $4.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the cost of each candy bar as \( c \).

Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each, so the total cost for the soft drinks is \( 2 \times 4 = $8 \).

He bought 5 candy bars, so the total cost for the candy bars is \( 5 \times c \).

The total amount he spent is the sum of the cost of the soft drinks and the candy bars, which is \( 28 \) dollars.

Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ 8 + 5c = 28 \]

Now, let's solve for \( c \):

\[
5c = 28 - 8 \\
5c = 20 \\
c = 20 / 5 \\
c = 4
\]

So, each candy bar cost $4.

Let's denote the cost of each candy bar as \( C \).

Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each, so he spent \( 2 \times 4 = $8 \) on soft drinks.

He also bought 5 candy bars, and the total amount spent is $28. Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars is \( 28 - 8 = $20 \).

Since he bought 5 candy bars and spent a total of $20, the cost of each candy bar is \( \frac{$20}{5} = $4 \).

Let's denote the cost of each candy bar as \( x \).

Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each, so the total cost for the soft drinks is \( 2 \times 4 = $8 \).

He also bought 5 candy bars, so the total cost for the candy bars is \( 5 \times x = 5x \).

The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the soft drinks and the candy bars, which is \( 8 + 5x \).

According to the problem, the total amount spent is $28, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 8 + 5x = 28 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 5x = 28 - 8 \]
\[ 5x = 20 \]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, each candy bar cost $4.

Let's denote the cost of each candy bar as \( C \) dollars.

Benny bought 2 soft drinks, which cost 2 * $4 = $8. He also bought 5 candy bars, each costing \( C \) dollars, so the total cost for the candy bars is 5 * \( C \) dollars.

The total amount he spent was $28. So, we can set up the equation:

Let the cost of each candy bar be x dollars.

Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each, so he spent 2 * $4 = $8 on soft drinks.

He spent a total of $28, and $8 went on soft drinks, so the remaining amount spent on candy bars is $28 - $8 = $20.

He bought 5 candy bars, so if each candy bar costs x dollars, the total cost for 5 candy bars will be 5x dollars.

We set this equal to the remaining amount he spent on candy bars: 5x = $20.

Now we solve for x:

5x = $20
x = $20 / 5
x = $4

Therefore, each candy bar costs $4.
