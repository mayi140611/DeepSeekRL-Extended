To determine how much money Randy had at first, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent over the year and then add that amount to the $104 he had left after a year.

First, calculate how much money Randy spends every month:
- He spends $2 each time he goes to the store.
- He makes 4 trips to the store each month.

So, the monthly spending is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/trip} \times 4 \text{ trips/month} = 8 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Next, calculate the monthly spending over a year:
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, the yearly spending is:
\[ 8 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 96 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Since Randy had $104 left after a year, we need to add this amount to his yearly spending to find out how much he had initially:
\[ 96 \text{ dollars} + 104 \text{ dollars} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Randy had $200 in his piggy bank at first.

Randy spends $2 every trip to the store and he goes to the store 4 times a month. So, he spends $2 * 4 = $8 each month. In a year, which has 12 months, he spends $8 * 12 = $96. If he had $104 left in his piggy bank after a year, then the amount of money he had at first is $104 + $96 = $200.

Let's calculate how much Randy spends on trips to the store in a year. 

Randy spends $2 per trip to the store. He makes 4 trips per month, so he spends 2 * 4 = $8 per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, he spends 8 * 12 = $96 per year on trips to the store.

If he had $104 left in his piggy bank after a year, then at first he had 104 + 96 = $200.

So, Randy had $200 in the piggy bank at first.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Randy had initially.

1. Calculate the total amount spent over a year:
   - Randy goes to the store 4 times a month.
   - He spends $2 per trip.
   - Therefore, he spends \( 4 \times 2 = \$8 \) per month.
   - Over a year (12 months), he spends \( 12 \times 8 = \$96 \).

2. Determine the initial amount of money Randy had:
   - After a year, Randy has $104 left.
   - Adding the money spent over the year to the amount he has left, we get the initial amount: \( 104 + 96 = \$200 \).

So, Randy had $200 in his piggy bank initially.

Randy spends $2 per trip to the store and makes 4 trips every month. Therefore, he spends $2 x 4 = $8 per month.

Over a year, he spends $8 x 12 = $96.

If he has $104 left after a year, then he originally had $104 + $96 = $200.

Therefore, Randy had $200 at first.

To determine how much money Randy had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he spent over the year and then add the amount he had left in his piggy bank.

First, let's calculate how much money Randy spends per trip to the store:
Randy spends $2 per trip to the store.

Next, we determine how many trips he makes in a year:
He makes 4 trips per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so he makes \(4 \times 12 = 48\) trips in a year.

Now, we calculate the total amount spent in a year:
\[ 48 \text{ trips} \times \$2/\text{trip} = \$96 \]

Randy had $104 left in his piggy bank after a year. Therefore, the total amount of money he had initially is the sum of the amount spent and the amount left:
\[ \$104 + \$96 = \$100 \]

So, Randy had $100 initially.

We need to determine how much money Randy had initially. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total expenditure for 1 trip to the store:**
   Randy spends $2 every time he goes to the store. He makes 4 trips to the store every month.

   \[
   \text{Cost per store trip} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of store trips per month} = 4
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total cost per month} = \text{Cost per trip} \times \text{Number of trips} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total expenditure for 1 year:**
   There are 12 months in a year.

   \[
   \text{Total cost for 1 year} = \text{Total cost per month} \times \text{Number of months} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the initial amount of money:**
   According to the problem, Randy has $104 dollars left at the end of a year.

   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = \text{Remaining amount} + \text{Total expenditure for 1 year}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 104 + 96 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Randy initially had 200 dollars.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Randy had as \( x \).

First, we calculate how much money Randy spends in a month:
- He spends 2 dollars each trip.
- He makes 4 trips each month.
- Therefore, he spends \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars per month.

Next, we calculate how much money Randy spends in a year:
- There are 12 months in a year.
- He spends 8 dollars each month.
- Therefore, he spends \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) dollars per year.

Randy has $104 left after a year. This means his total initial amount \( x \) can be found by adding the money he spends in a year to the money he has left:
\[ x = 96 + 104 \]
\[ x = 200 \]

So, Randy had $200 initially.

To determine how much money Randy had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on trips to the store over the year and then add that to the amount he had left in his piggy bank.

First, we find out how many trips Randy makes in a year. Since he makes 4 trips every month and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of trips he makes in a year is:
\[ 4 \text{ trips/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ trips/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Randy spends on trips to the store in a year. Since he spends $2 on each trip and he makes 48 trips in a year, the total amount spent is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/trip} \times 48 \text{ trips/year} = 96 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add the total amount spent to the amount of money he had left in his piggy bank to find out how much he had initially. His piggy bank had $104 left after the year, so the initial amount of money he had is:
\[ 96 \text{ dollars} + 104 \text{ dollars} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Randy had $200 at first.

To find out how much money Randy had initially, we need to calculate how much money he spends on trips to the store in a year and then subtract that from the amount he had left after a year.

1. Randy spends $2 per trip to the store. He makes 4 trips every month, so he spends:
   $2/trip × 4 trips/month = $8/month

2. There are 12 months in a year, so in a year he spends:
   $8/month × 12 months = $96

3. After spending $96 in a year, Randy had $104 left in his piggy bank.

4. To find out how much he had initially, we add the amount he spent to the amount he had left:
   $96 (spent) + $104 (left) = $200

Therefore, Randy had $200 initially.
