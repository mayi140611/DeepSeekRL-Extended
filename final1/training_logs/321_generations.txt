system
Let's denote Fred's salary from five months ago as \( F \) and Mike's salary from five months ago as \( M \).

From the problem, we have:
\[ F = $1000 \]

According to the problem statement, five months ago, Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred:
\[ M = 10F \]
\[ M = 10 \times 1000 \]
\[ M = $10000 \]

Now, Mike's salary has increased by 40%. To calculate the new salary, we apply the increase:
\[ \text{Increase in Mike's salary} = 0.40 \times M \]
\[ \text{Increase in Mike's salary} = 0.40 \times 10000 \]
\[ \text{Increase in Mike's salary} = $4000 \]

Therefore, Mike's new salary is:
\[ \text{New Mike's salary} = \text{Original Mike's salary} + \text{Increase in Mike's salary} \]
\[ \text{New Mike's salary} = 10000 + 4000 \]
\[ \text{New Mike's salary} = $14000 \]

Now, let's answer the question:
Mike's salary now is $14000.

To calculate Mike's current salary, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Mike's salary five months ago.
2. Calculate the current salary of Mike after a 40 percent increase.

First, we know that Mike's salary five months ago was ten times Fred's salary. Since Fred's salary 5 months ago was $1000, we have:
\[ \text{Mike's salary 5 months ago} = 10 \times 1000 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out Mike's current salary after a 40 percent increase. A 40 percent increase means Mike's new salary is 140 percent of his previous salary. We can calculate this as:
\[ \text{Current salary of Mike} = 10000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 10000 \times 1.40 = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mike's current salary is $14000.

Let's denote Mike's new salary as \( M \). Five months ago, his salary was \( M - 5000 \) (since 10 times more than his salary 5 months ago is $10000).

According to the information, Mike's salary increased by 40%, so his salary now can be represented as:
\[ M = M - 5000 + 0.40(M - 5000) \]
\[ M = 1.40(M - 5000) - 5000 \]
\[ M = 1.40M - 7000 - 5000 \]
\[ M - 1.40M = -7000 - 5000 \]
\[ -0.40M = -12000 \]
\[ M = 30000 \]

So, Mike's salary now is $30, 000.

To calculate Mike's salary now, we can use the following logic:

1. Five months ago, Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred. Since Fred's salary was $1000, Mike's salary five months ago was 10 times that amount, which is $10,000.
2. His salary has increased by 40 percent since then, so his new salary is 140% of his previous salary. This means his salary has increased by 40/100 * $10,000 = $4,000.
3. His new salary is $10,000 + $4,000 = $14,000.

Therefore, Mike's salary now is $14,000.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Five months ago, Fred's salary is $1000.
2. Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred at that time, so Mike's salary 5 months ago was:
   \( 10 \times 1000 = $10,000 \)
3. Currently, Mike's salary has increased by 40 percent. Let's calculate the increase in his salary:
   \( 40\% \) of \( $10,000 \) is:
   \( 0.40 \times 10,000 = $4,000 \)
4. Therefore, Mike's new salary is:

To find Mike's current salary, let's first understand how his salary increased 40% and compare it to Fred's salary from five months ago to five months ago adjusted by the increase in Mike's salary.

Five months ago, Fred's salary was $1000. Mike earned 10 times more than Fred. Therefore, Mike's salary five months ago was 10 times $1000, which is $10000.

Now, Mike's salary has increased by 40%. To find Mike's current salary:

\[ Mike's current salary = Mike's salary from five months ago + 40% of Mike's salary from five months ago. \]

\[ Mike's current salary = 10000 + 0.40 \times 10000 \]

\[ Mike's current salary = 10000 + 4000 \]

\[ Mike's current salary = 14000 \]

So, Mike's salary now is $14000.

To determine Mike's current salary, we start by calculating his salary five months ago. We know that his salary five months ago was 10 times Fred's salary, and Fred's salary was $1000.

\[
\text{Mike's salary five months ago} = 10 \times 1000 = 10000

Next, we need to account for the 40% increase in Mike's salary. A 40% increase means Mike's salary is now 140% of his salary five months ago. To find the current salary, we calculate 140% of $10000.

\[
\text{Current salary} = 10000 \times 1.40 = 14000

Let's denote Mike's salary five months ago as \( S \).

Given:
1. Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred five months ago.
2. Fred's salary five months ago was $1000.
3. Mike's salary has increased by 40% since then.

First, calculate Fred's current salary:
\[ \text{Fred's current salary} = \text{Fred's salary five months ago} + \text{40\% of Fred's current salary} \]

Since Mike's salary is 10 times more than Fred's salary five months ago:
\[ S = 10 \times \text{Fred's salary five months ago} \]

Given Fred's salary five months ago was $1000:
\[ S = 10 \times 1000 = 10000 \]

Now Fred's current salary:
\[ \text{Fred's current salary} = 1000 + 0.4 \times 1000 = 1000 + 400 = 1400 \]

Now, let's calculate Mike's current salary. Mike's current salary is his salary five months ago plus 40% increase:
\[ \text{Mike's current salary} = S + 0.4S = 1.4S \]

Substitute \( S = 10000 \):
\[ \text{Mike's current salary} = 1.4 \times 10000 = 14000 \]

Conclusion:
Mike's current salary is \( \$14000 \).

Let's break down the information given:

1. Five months ago, Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred.
2. Fred's salary five months ago was $1000.
3. Mike's salary has increased by 40% since then.

First, let's calculate Mike's salary five months ago:

Mike's salary five months ago = 10 × Fred's salary five months ago
Mike's salary five months ago = 10 × $1000
Mike's salary five months ago = $10,000

Next, we calculate Mike's salary now after a 40% increase:

Increase in Mike's salary = 40% of Mike's salary five months ago
Increase in Mike's salary = 0.40 × $10,000
Increase in Mike's salary = $4,000

Now, let's find Mike's current salary:

Mike's current salary = Mike's salary five months ago + Increase in Mike's salary
Mike's current salary = $10,000 + $4,000
Mike's current salary = $14,000

Therefore, Mike's salary now is $14,000.

Let's start by determining Fred's current salary. Since Fred's salary five months ago was $1000 and his salary has increased by 40%, we can calculate his current salary as follows:
\[ \text{Fred's current salary} = \text{Fred's salary five months ago} \times (1 + 0.40) = 1000 \times 1.40 = 1400 \]

Next, we know that Mike's salary was 10 times more than Fred's salary five months ago. Therefore, Mike's salary five months ago was:
\[ \text{Mike's salary five months ago} = 10 \times \text{Fred's salary five months ago} = 10 \times 1000 = 10000 \]

After the increase mentioned, Mike's current salary is 40% more than his salary five months ago. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Mike's current salary} = \text{Mike's salary five months ago} \times (1 + 0.40) = 10000 \times 1.40 = 14000 \]

To find out Mike's salary now, let's first establish the conditions we have been given and work through the problem step by step.

1. **Fred's Salary Five Months Ago:** 
   Fred's salary five months ago was $1000. 

2. **Mike's Salary Relationship Five Months Ago:**
   Mike earned 10 times more than Fred.

   Therefore, Mike's salary five months ago = 10 times Fred’s salary
   = \( 10 \times 1000 \)

   Mike's salary five months ago = 10,000.

3. **Salary Increase:**
   Now, Mike's salary has increased by 40%.

   To calculate the 40% increase:
   
   Increase in Mike's salary = 0.40 \(\times\) Mike's original salary
   = 0.40 \(\times\) 10,000

   Increase in Mike's salary = 4,000

4. **Calculating Mike's New Salary:**
   Mike's new salary = Mike's original salary + Increase in salary

   Mike's new salary = 10,000 + 4,000

5. **Miscalculation and Correct Calculation:**
   
   Let's re-examine:
   
   Mike's salary increased by 40% to his original salary. But this is incorrect because the increase in salary is taken over the initial 10x Mike's salary scenario.
   
   Increase in salary equals 40% of Mike's original salary before:
   
   40% of original salary = \( 0.40 \times 10000 \)

   Correct Calculation:

   40% increase in salary:
   
   40% of 10,000 = 4000

   Mike's new salary:
   
   New salary = original salary + increase

   New salary = 10,000 + 4,000
   
   Mike's new salary = 14,000

6. **Conclusion:**
   Mike's salary is $14,000 now.

Let's calculate the salary increase rate first. If Mike's salary increased by 40 percent, that means Mike's current salary is 140 percent of his former salary.
Let's assume Mike's salary five months ago was \( S \). Hence, \( S = 10 \times Fred's salary = 10 \times 1000 = 10000 \). So, \( S = 10000 \) dollars.
Now, we know that \( S \) increased by 40 percent, therefore \( 140\% \) of \( S \) is \( 1.4 \times 10000 = 14000 \).

Now, let's calculate Mike's current salary. To do that, we can say that his current salary is a certain \( x \% \) of his former salary. Hence, \( 14000 = x \% \times 10000 \).

So, \( x \% \) of 10000 is 10000, as his salary has increased by 40 percent. This implies that \( 40\% \) of 10000 is subtracted from 10000 to leave 14000.

Therefore, Mike's current salary now is $14000.

To calculate Mike's salary now, we first need to determine his salary five months ago. Since Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred five months ago, we can find his salary by multiplying Fred's salary by 10.

Fred's salary five months ago = $1000
Mike's salary five months ago = 10 * $1000 = $10000

Now, we know that Mike's salary has increased by 40 percent. To calculate the increase, we multiply his past salary by 40 percent.

Increase in salary = 40% of Mike's salary five months ago
Increase in salary = 0.40 * $10000 = $4000

To find his current salary, we add the increase to his past salary.

Mike's current salary = Mike's salary five months ago + Increase in salary
Mike's current salary = $10000 + $4000 = $14000

Therefore, Mike's salary now is $14000.
