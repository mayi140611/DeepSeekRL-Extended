Hally and her friends organized a high school reunion. To cover the cost of a late-night party that they planned for at the reunion, each attendee had to pay $100. After the party, Hally and her friends realized that the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. If there were 50 people at the party, how much money was used to pay for the party expenses?

Each attendee paid $100, so the total amount collected is \( 50 \times 100 = 5000 \) dollars. Given that the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions, the expenses amount to \( 5000 - 500 = 4500 \) dollars.

Let's denote the total contributions from the attendees as \( C \).

Each attendee paid $100, and there were 50 people at the party, so the total contributions would be \( 50 \times 100 = 5000 \).

The total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions, so the total expenses \( E \) were \( 5000 - 500 = 4500 \).

So, the amount of money used to pay for the party expenses is \( 4500 \).

Let's denote the total cost of the party as \( C \).

From the given information, we have two equations:

1. Each attendee paid $100, and there were 50 people. So, the total contributions from attendees would be \( 50 \times 100 = 5000 \) dollars.
2. The total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. So, \( C = 5000 - 500 \).

Now, we can calculate the cost of the party expenses:

\[ C = 5000 - 500 = 4500 \]

So, the amount of money used to pay for the party expenses is $4500.

Let's denote the total contributions from the attendees as \( C \).

According to the information given, each attendee had to pay $100, and there were 50 people. Therefore, the total contributions are:
\[ C = 100 \times 50 = 5000 \]

It is also given that the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. So the total expenses are:
\[ 5000 - 500 = 4500 \]

Hally and her friends are using this $4500 for the party expenses.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each attendee contributed $100, and there were 50 people at the party. Therefore, the total contributions were:
\[ 100 \, \text{dollars/attendee} \times 50 \, \text{attendees} = 5000 \, \text{dollars} \]

2. The total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. Therefore, the total expenses were:
\[ 5000 \, \text{dollars} - 500 \, \text{dollars} = 4500 \, \text{dollars} \]

3. This means that $4500 was used to pay for the party expenses.

Let's calculate the total contributions made by the attendees:

Number of attendees = 50
Amount per attendee = $100
Total contributions = Number of attendees * Amount per attendee
Total contributions = 50 * $100 = $5000

Now, we know that the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions:

Total expenses = Total contributions - (Total expenses = $500 less)
Total expenses = $5000 - $500 = $4500

So, the amount of money used to pay for the party expenses was $4500.

Let's denote the total contributions from the attendees as \( C \).

According to the problem, each attendee paid $100, so the total contributions can be calculated as:
\[
C = 100 \times \text{number of attendees}

Given there were 50 people:
\[
C = 100 \times 50 = 5000

The total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions, so:
\[
\text{Expenses} = C - 500 = 5000 - 500 = 4500

Let's start by determining the total contribution amount from the attendees at the party. Each attendee paid $100, and there were 50 people at the party. Hence, the total contribution is calculated as:

\[100 \text{ dollars/attendee} \times 50 \text{ attendees} = 5000 \text{ dollars}\]

According to the problem, the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. So, the total expenses can be calculated as:

\[5000 \text{ dollars} - 500 \text{ dollars} = 4500 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the amount of money used to pay for the party expenses is $4500.

First, calculate the total contributions from all attendees:
\[ \text{Total contributions} = 50 \times 100 = 5000 \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions:
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 5000 - 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Each person contributed $100 to cover the party expenses.
2. There were 50 people at the party.
3. The total contributions from all attendees would be $100 per person times 50 people, which equals $5,000.

Given that the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions, we can calculate the total expenses by subtracting $500 from the total contributions:

Total expenses = Total contributions - $500
Total expenses = $5,000 - $500
Total expenses = $4,500

So, the total amount of money used to pay for the party expenses was $4,500.

To determine the amount of money used to pay for the party expenses, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total contributions from attendees:**
   Each attendee paid $100. There were 50 people at the party.
   \[
   \text{Total contributions} = 50 \times 100 = 5000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the difference between total expenses and total contributions:**
   The total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 5000 - 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Total contributions: $5000
   - Additional information indicates there was a $500 shortfall.
   
   Therefore, the total expenses calculated earlier should be adjusted slightly to account for the $500 shortfall. However, given the context, the calculation should be straightforward without further adjustments.

Thus, the amount of money used to pay for the party expenses is:
\[
\boxed{4500}
\]

Let's denote the total contributions from each person as \( C \). Since there are 50 people at the party, the total contributions from all attendees would be \( 50 \times C \).

Given that each attendee had to pay $100, the total contributions from all attendees would be \( 50 \times 100 = 5000 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. So, the total expenses can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Total Contributions} - \text{Total Expenses} = 500 \]

\[ 5000 - \text{Total Expenses} = 500 \]

Now, solve for the total expenses:

\[ \text{Total Expenses} = 5000 - 500 \]

\[ \text{Total Expenses} = 4500 \]

So, $4500 was used to pay for the party's expenses.
