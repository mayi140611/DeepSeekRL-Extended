#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To calculate the total fuel consumption for both trips, we need to multiply the distance of each trip by the fuel consumption rate per km, which is 5 liters.

For the first trip of 30 km:
\[ 30 \text{ km} \times 5 \text{ liters/km} = 150 \text{ liters} \]

For the second trip of 20 km:
\[ 20 \text{ km} \times 5 \text{ liters/km} = 100 \text{ liters} \]

To find the total fuel consumption for both trips:
\[ 150 \text{ liters} + 100 \text{ liters} = 250 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, John should plan to use 250 liters of fuel for the two trips.

To calculate the total fuel usage, we first need to determine the total distance that John plans to travel.

First trip: 30 km
Second trip: 20 km

Total distance = 30 km + 20 km = 50 km

Given that John uses 5 liters of fuel per km, we can calculate the total fuel usage for the trips as follows:

Total fuel usage = Total distance × Fuel consumption rate
Total fuel usage = 50 km × 5 liters per km

Now, let's calculate:

Total fuel usage = 50 × 5 = 250 liters

Therefore, John should plan to use 250 liters of fuel for his two trips.

To determine the total fuel consumption, we first need to calculate the total distance John will be traveling. 

For the first trip of 30 km:
\[ \text{Fuel for first trip} = 30 \text{ km} \times 5 \text{ liters/km} = 150 \text{ liters} \]

For the second trip of 20 km:
\[ \text{Fuel for second trip} = 20 \text{ km} \times 5 \text{ liters/km} = 100 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the fuel consumption from both trips to get the total fuel consumption:
\[ \text{Total fuel consumption} = 150 \text{ liters} + 100 \text{ liters} = 250 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, John should plan to use 250 liters of fuel for his two trips.

First, we need to calculate the total distance that John plans to travel. The distance for the first trip is 30 km, and for the second trip is 20 km. So, the total distance is 30 km + 20 km = 50 km.

Next, we know that John uses 5 liters of fuel per km. So, to find out how many liters of fuel he should plan to use for the entire trip, we multiply the total distance by the fuel consumption rate. That gives us 50 km * 5 liters/km = 250 liters.

So, John should plan to use 250 liters of fuel for the two trips.

To calculate the total fuel consumption, we first determine the fuel usage for each trip and then sum these amounts.

For the first trip of 30 km:
\[ \text{Fuel for first trip} = 30 \text{ km} \times 5 \text{ liters/km} = 150 \text{ liters} \]

For the second trip of 20 km:
\[ \text{Fuel for second trip} = 20 \text{ km} \times 5 \text{ liters/km} = 100 \text{ liters} \]

Now we add the fuel used for both trips to get the total:
\[ \text{Total fuel} = 150 \text{ liters} + 100 \text{ liters} = 250 \text{ liters} \]

So, the answer is 250 liters.

To determine how many liters of fuel John should plan to use, we first calculate the fuel consumption for each individual trip and then sum them up for the total distance.

1. **First Trip (30 km)**:
   - Fuel per km = 5 liters
   - For 30 km, the fuel required is \(30 \times 5 = 150\) liters.

2. **Second Trip (20 km)**:
   - Fuel per km = 5 liters
   - For 20 km, the fuel required is \(20 \times 5 = 100\) liters.

3. **Total Fuel Required**:
   - Total distance = \(30 \, \text{km} + 20 \, \text{km} = 50 \, \text{km}\)
   - Total fuel required = \(50 \times 5 = 250\) liters.

Therefore, John should plan to use 250 liters of fuel for the two trips.

- Second trip: 20 km

Total distance = 30 km + 20 km = 50 km

Now, knowing that John uses 5 liters of fuel per km, we can calculate the total fuel required for both trips:

Total fuel required = Total distance * Fuel consumption per km
Total fuel required = 50 km * 5 liters/km
Total fuel required = 250 liters

To calculate the total fuel consumption, we simply need to multiply the distance of each trip by the fuel consumption rate per kilometer and then multiply the two results together.

For the first trip of 30 km:
Fuel for the first trip = 30 km * 5 L/km = 150 L

For the second trip of 20 km:
Fuel for the second trip = 20 km * 5 L/km = 100 L

Total fuel consumption:
Total fuel consumption = Fuel for the first trip + Fuel for the second trip
Total fuel consumption = 150 L + 100 L = 250 L

Therefore, John should plan to use 250 liters of fuel for the two trips.

To calculate the total fuel consumption, we first find the fuel consumption for each trip and then sum them up. 

For the 30 km trip:
Fuel consumption = speed * fuel efficiency
Speed = 30 km (given)
Fuel efficiency = 5 liters per km

So for the 30 km trip:
Fuel consumption = 30 km * 5 liters/km = 150 liters

For the 20 km trip:
Fuel consumption = 20 km * 5 liters/km = 100 liters

Now, we add the fuel consumption for both trips:

Total fuel consumption = 150 liters (for the first trip) + 100 liters (for the second trip)
Total fuel consumption = 250 liters

Therefore, John should plan to use 250 liters of fuel for his two trips.
