<reasoning>
Let's denote Andy's current age as \( A \) and Rahim's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, Rahim is currently 6 years old, so \( R = 6 \).

In 5 years, Andy's age will be \( A + 5 \). The problem states that in 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now. So we can write the equation:
\[ A + 5 = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ A + 5 = 12 \]
\[ A = 12 - 5 \]
\[ A = 7 \]

So Andy is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find out who is older and how much older Andy is than Rahim right now. Andy is 7 years old, while Rahim is 6 years old. Therefore, Andy is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ year} \]
older than Rahim.

Let's denote Andy's current age as \( A \) and Rahim's current age as \( R \). We are given that Rahim's current age \( R \) is 6. In 5 years, Andy's age will be \( A + 5 \), and we know this will be twice what Rahim's current age (which is 6) is, so \( A + 5 = 2 \times 6 \).

First, we calculate \( A + 5 = 12 \):
\[ A + 5 = 12 \]
\[ A = 12 - 5 \]
\[ A = 7 \]

Now we know Andy's current age is 7, and Rahim's current age is 6. The difference in their ages is \( 7 - 6 = 1 \) year.

So, Andy is currently 1 year older than Rahim.

Let's denote Andy's current age as \( A \) and Rahim's current age as \( R \). We know that \( R = 6 \).

According to the problem, in 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now. So, in 5 years, Andy's age will be \( A + 5 \) and Rahul's age will be \( R \). Thus, \( A + 5 = 2R \).

Substituting \( R = 6 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ A + 5 = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ A + 5 = 12 \]
\[ A = 12 - 5 \]
\[ A = 7 \]

Therefore, Andy is 7 years old now.

To find out how much older Andy is than Rahim currently, we subtract Rahim's age from Andy's age:
\[ A - R = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Conclusion: Andy is 1 year older than Rahim.

Let's denote Andy's current age as \( A \) and Rahim's current age as \( R \).

According to the problem, Rahim is 6 years old now, so \( R = 6 \).

In 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now. Rahim's age in 5 years will be \( R + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \). Andy's age in 5 years will be \( A + 5 \), and this age will be twice Rahim's current age:

\[ A + 5 = 2 \times 6 \]

Solving for \( A \):

\[ A + 5 = 12 \]
\[ A = 12 - 5 \]
\[ A = 7 \]

So, Andy is 7 years old now.

The difference in their ages is:

\[ \text{Age difference} = A - R = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Andy is 1 year older than Rahim right now.

Let's denote Andy's current age as \( A \) and Rahim's current age as \( R \).

According to the information given:
1. Rahim's age now is \( R = 6 \).
2. In 5 years, Andy's age will be \( A + 5 \).
3. At that time, Andy's age will be twice Rahim's current age: \( A + 5 = 2R \).

We can substitute \( R \) with 6 in the second equation:
\[ A + 5 = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ A + 5 = 12 \]
\[ A = 12 - 5 \]
\[ A = 7 \]

So, Andy is currently 7 years old.

To find out how much older Andy is than Rahim right now:
\[ A - R = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Andy is 1 year older than Rahim currently.

system
<reasoning>
Let's denote Andy's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, in 5 years, Andy's age will be twice Rahim's current age. Since Rahim is currently 6 years old, in 5 years, Rahim will be \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) years old. Therefore, in the future point, Andy's age will be \( A + 5 \), and it will be twice Rahim's age at that time, which is \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \). So we can write:
\[ A + 5 = 22 \]

To find Andy's current age \( A \), we solve the equation:
\[ A + 5 = 22 \]
\[ A = 22 - 5 \]
\[ A = 17 \]

So Andy is currently 17 years old.

To find out how much older Andy is than Rahim, we subtract Rahim's age from Andy's age:
\[ 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Therefore, Andy is currently 11 years older than Rahim.

Now we can solve for Andy's current age A by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation: A = 12 - 5 = 7.

So Andy is currently 7 years old. To find out how much older Andy is than Rahim, right now, we subtract Rahim's current age from Andy's current age: A - R = 7 - 6 = 1.

Let's denote Andy's current age as \( A \) and Rahim's current age as \( R \).

We know from the problem statement that Rahim's current age \( R \) is 6.

In 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now. So, in 5 years, Andy's age will be \( A + 5 \), and this should be equal to 2 times Rahim's current age \( R \):
\[ A + 5 = 2 \times R \]

Substituting \( R = 6 \) into the equation:
\[ A + 5 = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ A + 5 = 12 \]
\[ A = 12 - 5 \]
\[ A = 7 \]

Now, \( A \) represents Andy's current age, and \( R \) represents Rahim's current age, so Andy is currently 7 years older than Rahim.

Let's denote Andy's current age as \( A \) and Rahim's current age as \( R \). We are given that Rahim's current age \( R \) is 6. According to the problem, in 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now. So in 5 years, Andyâ€™s age will be \( A + 5 \), and in 5 years, Rahim's age will be \( R \). 

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ A + 5 = 2R \]

Since \( R = 6 \), we substitute 6 for \( R \) in the equation:
\[ A + 5 = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ A + 5 = 12 \]

So to find \( A \), we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
\[ A = 12 - 5 \]
\[ A = 7 \]

So Andy is currently 7 years old.

To find how much older Andy is than Rahim right now, we subtract Rahim's current age from Andy's current age:
\[ A - R = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Andy is 1 year older than Rahim.
