system
Maggie and Kelsey picked a total of 40 + 28 = 68 apples.
The average pulled was 30, thus the total number of apples pulled is 30 * 3 = 90 apples.
Layla picked 90 - 68 = 22 apples.

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we first need to calculate the total number of apples picked by all three girls together, based on the average they averaged.

The average number of apples picked by the three girls is 30. The total number of apples picked by the three girls together is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

We know that Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples. So, if Layla picked some apples, L (for Layla) can be calculated as:

\[ 90 - 40 - 28 = 22 \]

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we start by calculating the total number of apples picked by all three. Since the average number of apples picked by Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla is 30, the total number of apples picked by all three is \(30 \times 3 = 90\).

Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples, so the total number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey is \(40 + 28 = 68\).

Therefore, the number of apples picked by Layla is \(90 - 68 = 22\).

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we first need to calculate the total number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey. Then we can use the average to find Layla's contribution.

The total number of apples picked is the sum of what Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla picked. We are given that the average number of apples picked was 30, so we can set up the following equation to find Layla's contribution:

\[ \text{Total apples picked} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of people} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Total apples picked} = 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

Now, we know that Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples, so we can calculate the number of apples Layla picked by subtracting the sum of Maggie's and Kelsey's apples from the total number of apples picked:

\[ \text{Layla's apples} = \text{Total apples picked} - (\text{Maggie's apples} + \text{Kelsey's apples}) \]
\[ \text{Layla's apples} = 90 - (40 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Layla's apples} = 90 - 68 \]
\[ \text{Layla's apples} = 22 \]

So, Layla picked 22 apples.

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we first need to calculate the total number of apples picked by the three of them based on the average.

The average number of apples picked is given as 30. Since the three of them picked together, we multiply the average by the number of people:

\( \text{Total apples} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of people} \)
\( \text{Total apples} = 30 \times 3 \)
\( \text{Total apples} = 90 \)

Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples, so we add their apples to find out how many Layla picked:

\( \text{Layla's apples} = \text{Total apples} - (Maggie's apples + Kelsey's apples) \)
\( \text{Layla's apples} = 90 - (40 + 28) \)
\( \text{Layla's apples} = 90 - 68 \)
\( \text{Layla's apples} = 22 \)

So, Layla picked 22 apples.

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we need to establish an equation based on the information given.

First, let's determine the total number of apples picked by the three girls. Since they averaged 30 apples picked, we can multiply this average by the total number of girls:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

This means the total number of apples picked by all three girls is 90.

Next, we know Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples. Let's add those two amounts together:
\[ 40 + 28 = 68 \]

So, the combined number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey is 68.

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we subtract the combined number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey from the total number of apples picked by all three:
\[ 90 - 68 = 22 \]

Therefore, Layla picked 22 apples.

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we first need to calculate the total number of apples picked by Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla together. Since the average number of apples picked by the three of them is 30, we can multiply 30 by the total number of people, which is 3:

\(30 \times 3 = 90\)

This means the three of them together picked 90 apples.

Now we know Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples, so we can find out how many apples Layla picked by subtracting the number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey from the total number of apples:

\(90 - 40 - 28 = 22\)

So, Layla picked 22 apples.

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we need to calculate the total number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey, and then use the fact that the average of apples picked by Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla is 30 to find Layla's number of apples.

First, let's calculate the total number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey:

Maggie picked 40 apples.
Kelsey picked 28 apples.

Total apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey = 40 + 28 = 68 apples.

Since the average number of apples picked by everyone is 30, we can calculate the total number of apples picked by all three:

Total apples picked by all three = Average × Number of people
Total apples picked by all three = 30 × 3 = 90 apples.

Now, to find out how many apples Layla picked, we subtract the number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey from the total number of apples picked by all three.

Layla's apples = Total apples picked by all three - (Maggie's apples + Kelsey's apples)
Layla's apples = 90 - 68 = 22 apples.

So, Layla picked 22 apples.

Maggie picked 40 apples. Kelsey picked 28 apples. Together, they picked 40 + 28 = 68 apples.

The three averaged 30 apples, so together they picked 30 * 3 = 90 apples.

Since they have 68 apples together and the three are 90, Layla must have picked 90 - 68 = 22 apples.

Let's solve for Layla's apples:

(68 + Layla's apples) = 30 * 3

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we can use the formula for the average:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Apples}}{\text{Number of People}} \]

Given that the average number of apples picked is 30 and there are 3 people, we can rearrange the formula to find the total number of apples picked:

\[ \text{Total Apples} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of People} \]

\[ \text{Total Apples} = 30 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Total Apples} = 90 \]

Now, we know that Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples. So, the number of apples picked by Layla is the total minus the others:

\[ \text{Layla's Apples} = \text{Total Apples} - (\text{Maggie's Apples} + \text{Kelsey's Apples}) \]

\[ \text{Layla's Apples} = 90 - (40 + 28) \]

\[ \text{Layla's Apples} = 90 - 68 \]

\[ \text{Layla's Apples} = 22 \]

So, Layla picked 22 apples.

To determine how many apples Layla picked, we need to calculate the total number of apples picked by Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla, and then find out how many Layla picked.

First, let's denote the number of apples picked by Layla as \( L \).

The total number of apples picked by Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla can be represented as:
\[
M + K + L
\]
where \( M = 40 \) (apples picked by Maggie) and \( K = 28 \) (apples picked by Kelsey).

The average number of apples picked by the three is given as 30. The formula for the average is the total number of apples divided by the number of people (which is 3). Therefore, we can write the equation for the average as:
\[
\frac{M + K + L}{3} = 30
\]

Substituting the known values of \( M \) and \( K \) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{40 + 28 + L}{3} = 30
\]

Next, we solve for \( L \) by first isolating the sum \( 40 + 28 + L \):
\[
40 + 28 + L = 30 \times 3
\]

Calculate \( 30 \times 3 \):
\[
30 \times 3 = 90
\]

Now, substitute this value back into the equation:
\[
40 + 28 + L = 90
\]

Combine \( 40 \) and \( 28 \):
\[
68 + L = 90
\]

To find \( L \), subtract 68 from both sides of the equation:
\[
L = 90 - 68
\]
\[
L = 22
\]

Therefore, Layla picked \( \boxed{22} \) apples.
