system
First, we calculate the total number of guests invited by the bride and groom's families. The bride invited 20 couples from her side, which is 20 * 2 = 40 people. The groom invited 20 couples from his side, which is also 20 * 2 = 40 people. Adding these together gives us the total number of guests invited by the families:

40 (from the bride) + 40 (from the groom) = 80 people.

The reception had 180 people in total, so the number of friends who attended is the total number of guests minus the number of guests invited by the families:

180 (total guests) - 80 (guests invited by families) = 100 friends.

The bride and groom invited a total of \(20 + 20 = 40\) couples from their side of the family. Since each couple consists of 2 people, the total number of people from their side of the family is \(40 \times 2 = 80\).

The total number of guests at the reception is 180, so the number of friends who attended is \(180 - 80 = 100\).

The couple had invited a total of 20 couples from each side of the family, so they invited 20 couples from the bride's side and 20 couples from the groom's side, which adds up to 40 couples. Since each couple consists of 2 people, the bride and groom invited 40 * 2 = 80 people from their families. The total number of guests at the reception was 180, so the number of friends who attended the reception is 180 - 80 = 100.

The bride and groom each invited 20 couples, which is 20 * 2 = 40 people. There were 1 couple from each side of the family, plus the bride and groom, which is 1 + 2 = 3 people. The total number of invited people is 40 + 3 = 43 people. Given the total attendance is 180, the number of friends is 180 - 43 = 137 people.

The bride and groom invited a total of \(20 \times 2 = 40\) people from each side of their family. So, the total number of people invited from both families is \(40 \times 2 = 80\). The total number of guests at the reception is 180, so the number of friends who attended the reception is \(180 - 80 = 100\).

To find out how many friends attended the reception, we first need to calculate the total number of people from the bride and groom's families who were invited.

Each person from the bride's side and groom's side is invited to 20 couples, which means each family member, including themselves, is invited to 20 couples of people. Since each couple consists of 2 people, each person is invited to 20/2 = 10 guests.

The bride and groom invited 20 people from each side, so the total number of family members invited is 20 (bride's side) + 20 (groom's side) = 40 people.

Now, each family member is invited to 10 guests, so the total number of guests from the families is 40 * 10 = 400 guests.

The total number of guests at the reception is 180. So, the number of friends who attended the reception is the total number of guests minus the number of guests from the families.

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the reception is 180 - 400 = -220.

There is a problem with the given data because the total number of people invited (400) exceeds the number of guests at the reception (180). This indicates that there might be a mistake in the data provided. A correct scenario should have fewer invitations to avoid a negative number of friends.

Let's break this down:

1. The couple has invited 20 couples from each side of their family. This means they have invited 40 people from each family.
2. Since there are two family members (one from each side), the total for that side would be 40 + 40 = 80 people.
3. The total number of guests at the reception was 180.
4. To find the number of friends, we subtract the number of family guests from the total number of guests: 180 - 80 = 100.

Therefore, 100 friends attended the reception.

system
To find out how many friends attended the wedding reception, we need to start by calculating the number of individuals invited from the bride's and groom's families. Each of them invited 20 couples, and since each couple consists of 2 people, the total number of people from each side is:

\[ 20 \text{ couples} \times 2 \text{ people/couple} = 40 \text{ people} \]

Since this calculation is for each side of the family, we need to multiply this by 2 to account for both the bride and groom:

\[ 40 \text{ people} \times 2 = 80 \text{ people} \]

Now, we know the total number of guests is 180, so to find the number of friends who attended, we subtract the number of guests from the bride's and groom's families from the total number of guests:

\[ 180 \text{ people} - 80 \text{ people} = 100 \text{ friends} \]

So, 100 friends attended the reception.

To find out how many friends attended the reception, we first determine the number of guests the bride and groom invited from their family.

Each bride or groom invited 20 couples, and since there are 2 such couples per couple, they invited \(20 \times 2 = 40\) people from their side of the family.

The total number of guests invited from both sides is \(40 + 40 = 80\).

Since the total number of guests at the reception was 180, the number of friends who attended the reception is \(180 - 80 = 100\).
