#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
On his 12th birthday, John received 20 gifts. On his 13th birthday, he received 8 fewer gifts, so we subtract 8 from the 20 gifts he received on his 12th birthday.

\[ 20 - 8 = 12 \]

So, he received 12 gifts on his 13th birthday.

To find the total number of gifts he received between his 12th and 13th birthdays, we add the gifts from both birthdays together:

\[ 20 + 12 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of gifts John received between his 12th and 13th birthdays is 32.

To find out how many gifts John received on his 13th birthday, we subtract 8 from the number of gifts he received on his 12th birthday.

\( \text{Number of gifts on 13th birthday} = 20 - 8 = 12 \)

Now, we add the gifts from both birthdays to find the total number of gifts he received.

\( \text{Total gifts received} = 20 + 12 = 32 \)
