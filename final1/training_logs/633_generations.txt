system
The baker initially has 10 cheesecakes on display and 15 more in the fridge. So, the total number of cheesecakes is:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \]

The bakes has sold 7 cheesecakes from the display. So, the remaining number of cheesecakes is:

\[ 25 - 7 = 18 \]

Thus, there are 18 cheesecakes left to be sold.

To find out how many more cheesecakes are left to be sold, we first need to calculate the total number of cheesecakes available to be sold. Initially, there are 10 cheesecakes on the display and 15 more in the fridge, making a total of 10 + 15 = 25 cheesecakes.

Next, we subtract the 7 cheesecakes that have already been sold from the total number of cheesecakes available to be sold:

25 (total cheesecakes available) - 7 (cheesecakes sold) = 18 cheesecakes left to be sold.

To determine how many more cheesecakes are left to be sold, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cheesecakes initially available:
   - Cheesecakes on display: 10
   - Cheesecakes in the fridge: 15
   - Total cheesecakes: \(10 + 15 = 25\)

2. Subtract the number of cheesecakes sold from the total amount available:
   - Cheesecakes sold: 7
   - Remaining cheesecakes: \(25 - 7 = 18\)

Therefore, there are 18 cheesecakes left to be sold.

The baker has 10 cheesecakes on display plus 15 more in the fridge, making a total of \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) cheesecakes. After selling 7 from the display, the number of cheesecakes left on display is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \). Therefore, the total number of cheesecakes left to be sold is \( 3 + 15 = 18 \).

To find out how many more cheesecakes are left to be sold, we can start by adding the number of cheesecakes on display to the number of cheesecakes in the fridge.

There are 10 cheesecakes on display and 15 more in the fridge, so together there are:
10 + 15 = 25 cheesecakes.

The baker has sold 7 cheesecakes from the display. To find out how many more are left, we subtract the number of cheesecakes sold from the total number of cheesecakes.

So, the calculation would be:
25 - 7 = 18 cheesecakes left to be sold.

To find out how many cheesecakes are left to be sold, we first need to determine the total number of cheesecakes. The baker starts with 10 cheesecakes on display and has 15 more in the fridge, giving us:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ cheesecakes in total} \]

Next, we account for the cheesecakes sold from the display. The baker has sold 7 cheesecakes from the display. So, we subtract the sold cheesecakes from the total:

\[ 25 - 7 = 18 \text{ cheesecakes left to be sold} \]

Therefore, there are 18 more cheesecakes left to be sold.

To find out how many more cheesecakes are left to be sold, we need to add the number of cheesecakes still on the display and the number of cheesecakes still in the fridge, and then subtract the number of cheesecakes sold from the total.

Showing math:
1. Number of cheesecakes still on display = 10
2. Number of cheesecakes still in the fridge = 15
3. Number of cheesecakes sold = 7
4. Total number of cheesecakes to be sold = Number of cheesecakes still on display + Number of cheesecakes still in the fridge - Number of cheesecakes sold
5. Total number of cheesecakes to be sold = 10 + 15 - 7
6. Total number of cheesecakes to be sold = 25 - 7
7. Total number of cheesecakes to be sold = 18

So, there are 18 more cheesecakes left to be sold.

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cheesecakes available:**
   The baker has 10 cheesecakes on the display and 15 more in the fridge.
   \[
   10 + 15 = 25
   \]
   So, there are 25 cheesecakes in total initially.

2. **Account for the cheesecakes sold from the display:**
   The baker has sold 7 cheesecakes from the display.
   \[
   25 - 7 = 18
   \]
   Therefore, 18 cheesecakes are left to be sold.

3. **Verify the addition of remaining cheesecakes from the fridge:**
   Since the problem doesn't specify that any cheesecakes from the fridge have been sold, we assume all 15 remain.
   \[
   18 + 15 = 33
   \]
   This confirms that 18 cheesecakes are left to be sold from the display, and 15 more are from the fridge, giving a total of 33 cheesecakes left to be sold.

To find out how many cheesecakes are left to be sold, we need to consider both the display and the fridge.

1. Current cheesecakes on display: 10
2. Cheesecakes in the fridge: 15
3. Cheesecakes sold from the display: 7

After selling 7 cheesecakes from the display, we subtract this number from the total on display:

10 (display) - 7 (sold) = 3 remaining on the display

Now, we add the cheesecakes still in the fridge to the remaining display cheesecakes:

3 (display) + 15 (fridge) = 18 cheesecakes in total left to be sold.

Reasoning:
Initially, there are 10 cheesecakes on the display plus 15 in the fridge, which totals 25 cheesecakes. After selling 7 cheesecakes from the display, the remaining number of cheesecakes on display is 10 - 7 = 3. Adding these back to the 15 cheesecakes in the fridge, the baker has 3 + 15 = 18 more cheesecakes left to be sold.

Total cheesecakes available initially = 10 cheesecakes on display + 15 cheesecakes in the fridge = 25 cheesecakes.

Cheesecakes sold from the display = 7.

Total cheesecakes left to be sold = 25 total cheesecakes - 7 sold = 18 cheesecakes.

To find the total number of cheesecakes the baker has available, we first need to add the number of cheesecakes on the display to the number of cheesecakes in the fridge. The baker has 10 cheesecakes on display and 15 in the fridge, so:

\[ 10 \text{ cheesecakes (display)} + 15 \text{ cheesecakes (fridge)} = 25 \text{ cheesecakes} \]

Next, we need to subtract the number of cheesecakes that have been sold from the total number of cheesecakes available. The baker has sold 7 cheesecakes from the display, and the total number of cheesecakes is 25. Therefore:

\[ 25 \text{ cheesecakes} - 7 \text{ cheesecakes (sold)} = 18 \text{ cheesecakes left to be sold} \]

So, there are 18 more cheesecakes left to be sold.

After selling 7 cheesecakes from the display, the number of cheesecakes left on display is 10 - 7 = 3 cheesecakes.
