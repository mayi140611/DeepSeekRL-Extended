To determine how many apples Bill has left, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total apples picked by Bill:**
   Bill picked 50 apples.

2. **Apples given to each child:**
   Each of his two children takes 3 apples to school.

   \[
   3 \text{ apples/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. **Total apples used by the children:**
   Subtract the apples given to the children from the total picked.

   \[
   50 \text{ apples} - 6 \text{ apples} = 44 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. **Apples used by Jill to bake pies:**
   Jill bakes 2 apple pies using 10 apples per pie.

   \[
   2 \text{ pies} \times 10 \text{ apples/pie} = 20 \text{ apples}
   \]

5. **Total apples used in all:**
   Add the apples used by the children to the apples used by Jill.

   \[
   44 \text{ apples} + 20 \text{ apples} = 64 \text{ apples}
   \]

6. **Apples left with Bill:**
   Subtract the total apples used from the initial total picked.

   \[
   50 \text{ apples} - 64 \text{ apples} = -14 \text{ apples}
   \]

Since Bill cannot have a negative number of apples, it means all his apples have been used, and Bill will not have any apples left.

To determine how many apples Bill has left, we can break down the problem into two parts: the apples given to his children and the apples used for baking.

1. **Apples given to children:**
   - Each of Bill's two children takes 3 apples to school.
   - Therefore, both children together take \( 3 \text{ apples/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ apples} \).

2. **Apples used for baking:**
   - Jill bakes 2 apple pies.
   - Each pie uses 10 apples.
   - Therefore, for 2 pies, Jill uses \( 10 \text{ apples/pie} \times 2 \text{ pies} = 20 \text{ apples} \).

3. **Total apples used:**
   - Apples given to children \( + \) apples used for baking \( = 6 \text{ apples} + 20 \text{ apples} = 26 \text{ apples} \).

4. **Apples left:**
   - Bill originally picked 50 apples.
   - Subtract the total apples used from the original amount:
   - \( 50 \text{ apples} - 26 \text{ apples} = 24 \text{ apples} \).

So, Bill has 24 apples left.

Let's calculate the total number of apples Bill uses:

- Each of his children takes 3 apples to school, so 2 children take 2 * 3 = 6 apples.
- Jill bakes 2 apple pies, using 10 apples per pie, so 2 pies use 2 * 10 = 20 apples.

Now, we sum up all the apples used:
- Apples for school: 6
- Apples for pies: 20
- Total used: 6 + 20 = 26 apples

The total number of apples picked was 50. Therefore, the number of apples left after using some is:
- Apples left: 50 - 26 = 24 apples

To determine how many apples Bill has left, let's break down the information given:

1. Bill initially has 50 apples.
2. He sends each of his two children to school with 3 apples for their two favorite teachers. Therefore, the children send 2 * 3 = 6 apples to school.
3. His wife Jill bakes two apple pies, using 10 apples per pie. So, the pies use a total of 2 * 10 = 20 apples.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples used:
- Apples given to children: 6
- Apples used for pies: 20
Total apples used = 6 + 20 = 26

Finally, let's find out how many apples Bill has left:
- Initial apples: 50
- Apples used: 26
Apples left = 50 - 26

Therefore, Bill has 24 apples left.

To determine how many apples Bill has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples Bill sends to school.
2. Subtract the number of apples sent to school from the total number of apples he picked.
3. Calculate the number of apples used for baking pies.
4. Subtract the number of apples used for baking pies from the remaining apples after sending them to school.
5. The result will be the number of apples Bill has left.

Let's go through each step:

1. Bill sends each of his two kids to school with 3 apples each. Therefore, he sends:
   \[
   2 \text{ kids} \times 3 \text{ apples/kid} = 6 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. Subtract the apples sent to school from the total number of apples picked:
   \[
   50 \text{ apples} - 6 \text{ apples} = 44 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. Jill bakes two apple pies, using 10 apples per pie. Therefore, she uses:
   \[
   2 \text{ pies} \times 10 \text{ apples/pie} = 20 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. Subtract the apples used for baking pies from the remaining apples after sending them to school:
   \[
   44 \text{ apples} - 20 \text{ apples} = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]

Therefore, Bill has 24 apples left.

Bill initially has 50 apples. He sends each of his two children to school with 3 apples, so he sends a total of \(2 \times 3 = 6\) apples to his children. After this, he has \(50 - 6 = 44\) apples left.

His wife Jill bakes two apple pies, using 10 apples per pie. Therefore, she uses \(2 \times 10 = 20\) apples for the pies. After baking, he has \(44 - 20 = 24\) apples left.

So, the final number of apples Bill has is 24.

To determine how many apples Bill has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples Bill sends to his children's school.
2. Calculate the number of apples Jill uses to bake the pies.
3. Subtract the total number of apples used from the initial number of apples.

Step 1:
Bill sends each of his two kids to school with 3 apples, so the total number of apples sent to school is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples/kid} \times 2 \text{ kids} = 6 \text{ apples} \]

Step 2:
Jill bakes two apple pies, using 10 apples per pie, so the total number of apples used for the pies is:
\[ 10 \text{ apples/pie} \times 2 \text{ pies} = 20 \text{ apples} \]

Step 3:
The initial number of apples Bill picked is 50. After sending 6 apples to school and using 20 apples for the pies, the number of apples left is:
\[ 50 \text{ apples} - 6 \text{ apples} - 20 \text{ apples} = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the number of apples Bill has left is \(\boxed{24}\).

First, we calculate the total number of apples used by the children: \(2 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ apples per child} = 6 \text{ apples}\).

Next, we calculate the number of apples used by Jill for baking the pies: \(2 \text{ pies} \times 10 \text{ apples per pie} = 20 \text{ apples}\).

Now, we add the apples used by the children and the pies: \(6 \text{ apples} + 20 \text{ apples} = 26 \text{ apples}\).

Finally, we subtract the total number of apples used from the total number of apples picked: \(50 \text{ apples} - 26 \text{ apples} = 24 \text{ apples}\).
