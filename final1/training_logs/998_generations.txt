<reasoning>
1. Let the monthly cell phone expenses be denoted as \( C \).
2. According to the problem, Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, which costs $800. So, the monthly cell phone expenses \( C \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   C = 800 + 400 = 1200
   \]
3. The tournament costs 20% more than her monthly cell phone expenses. So, the cost of the tournament \( T \) is:
   \[
   T = 1200 + 0.20 \times 1200 = 1200 + 240 = 1440
   \]
4. Therefore, the total amount Cheryl pays upon signing up for the golf tournament is $1440.

To calculate the total amount Cheryl pays upon signing up for the golf tournament, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Cheryl's monthly cell phone expenses.
2. Calculate the entry fee for the golf tournament.
3. Add the entry fee to the total expenses (cell phone and electricity).

Step 1: Calculate Cheryl's monthly cell phone expenses.
Since Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, which costs $800:
\[ \text{Cell phone expenses} = \$800 + \$400 = \$1200 \]

Step 2: Calculate the entry fee for the golf tournament.
The tournament costs 20% more than her monthly cell phone expenses to enter the tournament:
\[ \text{Entry fee} = \$1200 + (20\% \times \$1200) \]
\[ \text{Entry fee} = \$1200 + \$240 \]
\[ \text{Entry fee} = \$1440 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount she pays upon signing up for the golf tournament.
Add the entry fee to the total expenses (cell phone and electricity):
\[ \text{Total amount} = \$1440 + \$800 \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = \$2240 \]

Therefore, Cheryl pays a total of $2240 upon signing up for the golf tournament.

To calculate the total amount Cheryl pays upon signing up for the golf tournament, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Cheryl's monthly cell phone expenses.
2. Calculate the cost of entering the golf tournament.
3. Sum the cell phone expenses and the golf tournament cost.

Step 1: Calculate monthly cell phone expenses.
Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, which costs $800.
Cell phone expenses = $800 + $400 = $1200

Step 2: Calculate the golf tournament cost.
The golf tournament costs 20% more than her monthly cell phone expenses.
Golf tournament cost = $1200 + ($1200 * 20%) = $1200 + ($1200 * 0.20) = $1200 + $240 = $1440

Step 3: Sum the cell phone expenses and the golf tournament cost.
Total amount = Cell phone expenses + Golf tournament cost = $1200 + $1440 = $2640

Therefore, the total amount Cheryl pays upon signing up for the golf tournament is $2640.

To find out the total amount Cheryl pays upon signing up for the golf tournament, we need to determine her monthly cell phone expenses first. We know that her monthly cell phone expenses are $400 more than her electricity bill, which costs $800. Therefore, her monthly cell phone expenses are \( \$800 + \$400 = \$1200 \).

The cost to enter the golf tournament is 20% more than her monthly cell phone expenses. To find out this amount, we calculate 20% of $1200 and add it to the original amount.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$1200 = 0.20 \times \$1200 = \$240 \]

Adding this to her monthly cell phone expenses:

\[ \$1200 + \$240 = \$1440 \]

Therefore, Cheryl pays $1440 upon signing up for the golf tournament.

To calculate the total amount Cheryl pays upon signing up for the golf tournament, we need to first find her monthly cell phone expenses. Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, which costs $800. Therefore, her monthly cell phone expenses are:
$400 (extra spend) + $800 (electricity bill) = $1200
The golf tournament costs 20% more than her monthly cell phone expenses. To find this amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
20% of $1200 = 0.20 * $1200 = $240
Adding this $240 to her monthly cell phone expenses gives us the total cost for the golf tournament:
$1200 (cell phone expenses) + $240 (20% more) = $1440
Therefore, Cheryl pays $1440 upon signing up for the golf tournament.
