#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Jake starts with $5000 and spends $2800 on a new motorcycle, leaving him with $5000 - $2800 = $2200.

Then, he spends half of what's left on a concert ticket, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2200 = 1100 \). After this purchase, he has \( 2200 - 1100 = 1100 \) left.

Finally, he loses a fourth of what he has left, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 1100 = 275 \). After losing this amount, he has \( 1100 - 275 = 825 \) left.

Jake starts with $5000. After spending $2800 on a new motorcycle, he has:

$5000 - $2800 = $2200 left.

Then, he spends half of what's left on a concert ticket, so he spends:

$2200 / 2 = $1100.

After buying the concert ticket, he has:

$2200 - $1100 = $1100 left.

Then, Jake loses a fourth of what he has left, so he loses:

$1100 / 4 = $275.

Therefore, the amount of money Jake has left is:

$1100 - $275 = $825.

Jake starts with $5000.

First, he spends $2800 on a new motorcycle. So, he has $5000 - $2800 = $2200 left.

Next, he spends half of what's left on a concert ticket. Half of $2200 is $1100, so he has $2200 - $1100 = $1100 left.

Then, he loses a fourth of what he has left. A fourth of $1100 is $275, so he loses $275 and has $1100 - $275 = $825 left.

Jake initially has $5000. He spends $2800 on a motorcycle, leaving him with:
\[ 5000 - 2800 = 2200 \]

Then, he spends half of what's left on a concert ticket:
\[ \frac{2200}{2} = 1100 \]

So after buying the concert ticket, Jake has:
\[ 2200 - 1100 = 1100 \]

Next, Jake loses a fourth of what he has left:
\[ \frac{1100}{4} = 275 \]

This means Jake loses $275, leaving him with:
\[ 1100 - 275 = 825 \]
