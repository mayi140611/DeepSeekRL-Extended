###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A big snowstorm caused a large amount of snow to fall onto Grandpa's farm, and the wind caused the snow to pile up into a drift.  But on the second day, it warmed up enough that half of the snowdrift melted.  The third day, it snowed again, adding another 6 inches of snow onto the snowdrift.  On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift.  If the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, how deep in inches was the drift at the end of the first day?

system
Let's denote the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day as \( x \) inches.

On the second day, half of the snowdrift melted, so the depth became \( \frac{x}{2} \).

On the third day, it snowed an additional 6 inches, making the depth \( \frac{x}{2} + 6 \).

On the fourth day, it snowed an additional 18 inches, making the depth \( \frac{x}{2} + 6 + 18 = \frac{x}{2} + 24 \).

We know the depth at the end of the fourth day is 34 inches, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 24 = 34. \]
To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 10. \]
Then we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ x = 20. \]

So, the snowdrift was 20 inches deep at the end of the first day.

At the end of the second day, the snowdrift was half the depth it was on the first day, since half of the snow melted. Therefore, the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day was \(34 \div 2 = 17\) inches.

At the end of the fourth day, there was 18 inches of snow, so before the 18 inches of snow fell on the third day, there must have been \(18 - 6 = 12\) inches. Before the snowfall on the second day, there was 12 inches, and before the snowfall on the first day, there must have been \(12 - 6 = 6\) inches. 

Thus, the snowdrift was 6 inches deep at the end of the first day.

Let's denote the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day as \( x \) inches.

1. **After the second day**: The snowdrift melted by half due to warming:
   \[
   \text{Depth after melting} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. **After the third day**: 6 inches of new snow fell, so the depth becomes:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} + 6
   \]

3. **After the fourth day**: 18 inches of new snow fell, so the depth becomes:
   \[
   \left(\frac{x}{2} + 6\right) + 18
   \]

We know that at the end of the fourth day, the snowdrift depth was 34 inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\left(\frac{x}{2} + 6\right) + 18 = 34
\]

First, simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{2} + 6 + 18 = 34
\]

Combine the constants on the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{x}{2} + 24 = 34
\]

Subtract 24 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 10
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 20
\]

Thus, the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day was \( x = 20 \) inches.

Let's denote the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day as \(D\).

On the second day, half of the snowdrift melted, so the depth became \(\frac{D}{2}\).

On the third day, 6 inches of snow fell, so the depth became \(\frac{D}{2} + 6\).

On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell, so the depth became \(\frac{D}{2} + 6 + 18 = \frac{D}{2} + 24\).

According to the problem, at the end of the fourth day, the snowdrift was 34 inches deep. So we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{D}{2} + 24 = 34
\]

To solve for \(D\), we first subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{D}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \(D\):
\[
D = 20

So, at the end of the first day, the snowdrift was 20 inches deep.

Let's denote the initial depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day as \(x\) inches.

The snowdrift was melted to half its depth on the second day, so it became \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches deep.

On the third day, an additional 6 inches of snow fell, making the depth \( \frac{x}{2} + 6 \) inches.

On the fourth day, an additional 18 inches of snow fell, making the depth of the snowdrift \( \frac{x}{2} + 6 + 18 \) inches.

According to the problem, the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day:

Let's denote the depth of the snowdrift on the first day as \( x \) inches.

1. **Second day:** The snow melted, so the depth decreased by half, resulting in \( x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \) inches remaining.

2. **Third day:** The depth increased by 6 inches, leading to \( \frac{x}{2} + 6 \) inches.

3. **Fourth day:** The depth increased by another 18 inches, resulting in \( \frac{x}{2} + 6 + 18 = \frac{x}{2} + 24 \) inches.

We know from the problem statement that at the end of the fourth day, the snowdrift was 34 inches deep. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Let's denote the depth of the snowdrift at the end of each day as follows:
1. At the end of the first day: \(D_1\)
2. At the end of the second day: \(D_2\)
3. At the end of the third day: \(D_3 = D_2 - \frac{1}{2}D_2 = \frac{1}{2}D_2\)
4. At the end of the fourth day: \(D_4 = \frac{1}{2}D_3 + 6 + 18\)

Given that \(D_4 = 34\) inches, we can set up the equation:
\[34 = \frac{1}{2}D_3 + 6 + 18\]
\[34 = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}D_2\right) + 24\]
\[34 = \frac{1}{4}D_2 + 24\]
\[34 - 24 = \frac{1}{4}D_2\]
\[10 = \frac{1}{4}D_2\]
\[D_2 = 20\]

So, the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the second day was 20 inches. This means that the snowdrift had melted half of its depth on the second day.

Given that \(D_2 = 20\), we can find \(D_1\):
\[D_2 = D_1 - \frac{1}{2}D_1\]
\[20 = D_1 - \frac{1}{2}D_1\]
\[20 = \frac{1}{2}D_1\]
\[D_1 = 40\]

Therefore, the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day was 40 inches.

At the end of the fourth day, the snowdrift was 34 inches deep. This depth resulted from the snowfall and melting over the four days. 

Let's breakdown the snowfall and melting on each day:

1. Day 1: The snowdrift was formed.
2. Day 2: Half of the snowdrift melted, leaving half of its depth, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 34 = 17 \) inches.
3. Day 3: 6 inches of snow were added.  
4. Day 4: 18 inches of snow were added.

To find the initial depth of the snowdrift on the first day, we need to reverse the melt process and subtract all the snow that fell on subsequent days.

At the end of Day 2, the depth was 17 inches (half of the day 1 depth). On Day 3, 6 inches of snow were added, bringing the depth to \( 17 + 6 = 23 \) inches. On Day 4, an additional 18 inches of snow were added, bringing the total to \( 23 + 18 = 41 \) inches. 

So, the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day, before any snow melted, would be:

\[ \text{Depth after Day 2} = 17 \]
\[ \text{Depth after Day 3} = 17 + 6 = 23 \]
\[ \text{Depth after Day 4} = 23 + 18 = 41 \]

So, the initial depth of the snowdrift on the first day is 17 inches.

Let's denote the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day as \( x \) inches. 

After the first day, half of this snow melts, so the depth becomes \( \frac{x}{2} \).

Then, on the second day, half of the remaining snow melts, so the depth becomes \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

On the third day, the drift melts further with half of it melting, so the depth becomes \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{8} \).

On the fourth day, an additional 6 inches of snow fall onto the drift, so the depth becomes \( \frac{x}{8} + 6 \).

The fifth day is not mentioned in the problem, so it can be assumed that no further snow fell, and the depth remains the same.

According to the problem, at the end of the fourth day, the depth of the snowdrift is 34 inches. 

So, we have \( \frac{x}{8} + 6 = 34 \).

Solving this equation for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x}{8} = 34 - 6 \\
\frac{x}{8} = 28 \\
x = 28 \times 8 \\
x = 224
