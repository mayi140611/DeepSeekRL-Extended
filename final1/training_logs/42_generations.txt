To determine how many bananas each monkey would get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas in the 6 piles with 9 hands each.
2. Calculate the total number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles with 12 hands each.
3. Find the total number of bananas by adding the results from steps 1 and 2.
4. Divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys (12) to find out how many bananas each monkey would get.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. For the 6 piles with 9 hands each:
   - Each pile has 14 bananas.
   - Total bananas in these piles = \(6 \times 9 \times 14\).

2. For the remaining 4 piles with 12 hands each:
   - Each pile has 9 bananas.
   - Total bananas in these piles = \(4 \times 12 \times 9\).

3. Total number of bananas:
   - Total bananas = \(6 \times 9 \times 14\) + \(4 \times 12 \times 9\).

4. Each monkey's share:
   - Number of monkeys = 12.
   - Bananas per monkey = Total bananas / 12.

Now, let's calculate the exact numbers:

1. \(6 \times 9 \times 14 = 636\) bananas in the 6 piles.
2. \(4 \times 12 \times 9 = 432\) bananas in the remaining 4 piles.
3. Total bananas = \(636 + 432 = 1068\) bananas.
4. Each monkey's share = \(1068 / 12 = 89\) bananas.

Therefore, each monkey would get 89 bananas if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas in the 6 piles with 9 hands, where each hand has 14 bananas. 
The total number of bananas in these piles is 6 piles * 9 hands * 14 bananas/hand = 756 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles, each with 12 hands, where each hand has 9 bananas.
The total number of bananas in these piles is 4 piles * 12 hands * 9 bananas/hand = 432 bananas.

Adding these two quantities together, we find the total number of bananas is 756 bananas + 432 bananas = 1188 bananas.

Since there are 12 monkeys in the family, we divide the total number of bananas by 12 to determine how many bananas each monkey would get.
1188 bananas / 12 monkeys = 99 bananas/monkey

Therefore, each monkey would get 99 bananas if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves.

To determine how many bananas each monkey would get, we need to calculate the total number of bananas first.

First, calculate the number of bananas in the 6 piles with 9 hands:
\[ 6 \text{ piles} \times 9 \text{ hands/pile} \times 14 \text{ bananas/hand} = 6 \times 9 \times 14 = 756 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, calculate the number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles with 12 hands:
\[ 4 \text{ piles} \times 12 \text{ hands/pile} \times 9 \text{ bananas/hand} = 4 \times 12 \times 9 = 432 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, sum the bananas from all the piles to find the total number of bananas:
\[ 756 \text{ bananas} + 432 \text{ bananas} = 1188 \text{ bananas} \]

Finally, divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find out how many bananas each monkey would get:
\[ \frac{1188 \text{ bananas}}{12 \text{ monkeys}} = 99 \text{ bananas/monkey} \]

Thus, each monkey would get 99 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas, we first need to calculate the total bananas in the 6 piles that each had 9 hands with 14 bananas each. We do this by multiplying 9 hands by 14 bananas:
$$9 \times 14 = 126$$
Now, we multiply this result with the number of 9-hand piles to find the total number of bananas in these piles:
$$126 \times 6 = 756$$
Next, we calculate the total number of bananas in the 4 piles that each had 12 hands with 9 bananas each. We do this by multiplying 12 hands by 9 bananas:
$$12 \times 9 = 108$$
Then, we multiply this result with the number of 12-hand piles to find the total number of bananas in these piles:
$$108 \times 4 = 432$$
Finally, we add the total number of bananas in both types of piles to get the total number of bananas collected by the family:
$$756 + 432 = 1188$$
To find out how many bananas each monkey would get if the bananas were divided equally amongst themselves, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys:
$$1188 \div 12 = 99$$
Therefore, each monkey would get 99 bananas if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves.

Reasoning:
First, let's calculate the total number of bananas in the piles with 9 hands. There are 6 piles of this size, and each has 9 hands with 14 bananas, so each pile has 9 hands * 14 bananas/hand = 126 bananas. In total, there are 6 piles * 126 bananas/pile = 756 bananas from these piles.
Next, let's calculate the total number of bananas in the piles with 12 hands. There are 10 piles in total, and 6 out of them have these sizes, so there are 4 piles * 12 hands * 9 bananas/hand = 432 bananas from these piles.
Now, let's add up the bananas from all the piles, which is 756 + 432 = 1188 bananas in total. Finally, let's divide them equally amongst the 12 monkeys, so each monkey would get 1188 / 12 = 99 bananas.

Answer:
Each monkey would get 99 bananas if they divide them equally amongst themselves.

To determine the total number of bananas collected, we first calculate the number of bananas in the 6 piles each with 9 hands, given that each hand has 14 bananas:

\[ 6 \, \text{piles} \times 9 \, \text{hands/pile} \times 14 \, \text{bananas/hand} = 882 \, \text{bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles, each with 12 hands, given that each hand has 9 bananas:

\[ 4 \, \text{piles} \times 12 \, \text{hands/pile} \times 9 \, \text{bananas/hand} = 432 \, \text{bananas} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of bananas:

\[ 882 + 432 = 1314 \, \text{bananas} \]

There are 12 monkeys, and these bananas need to be divided equally, so we divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys:

\[ \frac{1314 \, \text{bananas}}{12 \, \text{monkeys}} = 109.5 \, \text{bananas/monkey} \]

So, each monkey would get 109.5 bananas.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas in the first set of 6 piles:
   - Each of the 6 piles has 9 hands, and each hand has 14 bananas.
   - Total number of bananas = 6 piles × 9 hands/pile × 14 bananas/hand = 756 bananas.

2. Calculate the total number of bananas in the remaining piles:
   - There are 10 piles in total, and out of these, 6 piles have 9 hands with 14 bananas each, leaving us with 4 piles that each have 12 hands with 9 bananas each.
   - Total number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles = 4 piles × 12 hands/pile × 9 bananas/hand = 432 bananas.

3. Calculate the total number of bananas:
   - Total bananas = 756 bananas + 432 bananas = 1188 bananas.

4. Since there are 12 monkeys in the family, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys:
   - Bananas per monkey = 1188 bananas ÷ 12 monkeys = 99 bananas/monkey.

Therefore, each monkey would get 99 bananas if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves.

1. Calculate the total number of bananas in the 6 piles with 9 hands.
2. Calculate the total number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles with 12 hands.
3. Add these two totals to find the overall number of bananas.
4. Divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find out how many bananas each monkey would get.

Let's perform these calculations:

1. The total number of bananas in the 6 piles with 9 hands:
   - Each pile has 9 hands, each hand has 14 bananas, so each pile contains \(9 \times 14\).
   - There are 6 such piles, so the total is \(6 \times 9 \times 14\).

\[6 \times 126 = 756\]

2. The total number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles with 12 hands:
   - Each pile has 12 hands, each hand has 9 bananas, so each pile contains \(12 \times 9\).
   - There are 4 such piles, so the total is \(4 \times 12 \times 9\).

\[4 \times 108 = 432\]

3. The overall total number of bananas:
   - We add the two totals from steps 1 and 2.
   - \(756 + 432 = 1188\).

4. The number of bananas each monkey would get:
   - We divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys (12).
   - \(1188 \div 12 = 99\).

Therefore, each monkey would get 99 bananas if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves.

To find out how many bananas each monkey will get, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas collected by the monkeys.

For the 6 piles with 9 hands:
Each pile has 9 hands, and each hand has 14 bananas.
So, each pile has 9 * 14 = 126 bananas.
Since there are 6 piles, the total number of bananas is 6 * 126 = 756 bananas.

For the remaining 4 piles with 12 hands:
Each pile has 12 hands, and each hand has 9 bananas.
So, each pile has 12 * 9 = 108 bananas.
Since there are 4 piles, the total number of bananas is 4 * 108 = 432 bananas.

Now, we add the bananas from both sets of piles:
