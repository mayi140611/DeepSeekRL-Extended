<reasoning>
First, calculate the total number of Dutch people on the bus. Since 3/5 of the 90 people were Dutch, the number of Dutch people is:
\[ \text{Number of Dutch} = \frac{3}{5} \times 90 = 54 \]

Next, find out how many of these Dutch people were also American. Since 1/2 of the Dutch were American, the number of Dutch Americans is:
\[ \text{Number of Dutch Americans} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \]

Now, determine how many of these Dutch Americans got window seats. Since 1/3 of the Dutch Americans got window seats, the number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows is:
\[ \text{Number of Dutch Americans in windows} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows is 9.

First, we need to find out how many people were Dutch on the bus. Since 3/5 of the 90 people on the bus were Dutch, the number of Dutch people is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 90 = 54 \]

Out of these 54 Dutch people, 1/2 of them were also American, meaning 1/4 of the Dutch people were not Dutch. To find the number of Dutch people who were not Dutch, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 54 = 13.5 \]

Since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we round to the nearest whole number, giving us 13 non-Dutch Dutch people.

Now, out of these 13 Dutch people, 1/3 got window seats. The number of Dutch people who got window seats is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 13 = 4.3333... \]

Again, since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we round to the nearest whole number, giving us 4 Dutch people who got window seats.

Therefore, the number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows is 4.

To determine the number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Dutch people on the bus.
2. Determine the number of Dutch Americans.
3. Calculate how many of these Dutch Americans sat at the windows.
</reasoning>
<answer>
3/5 of the 90 people on the bus were Dutch, which is 90 * 3/5 = 54 Dutch people.
Of these 54 Dutch people, 1/2 were also American, so 1/2 * 54 = 27 Dutch Americans.
1/3 of these Dutch Americans got window seats, so 1/3 * 27 = 9 Dutch Americans sat at the windows.
</answer>
The number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows is 9.

First, we need to determine the number of Dutch people on the bus. Since 3/5 of the 90 people on the bus were Dutch, we calculate as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Dutch people} = \frac{3}{5} \times 90 = 54 \]

Next, we find out how many of the Dutch people are also American. This is given to be half of the Dutch people:
\[ \text{Number of Dutch Americans} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \]

Out of these 27 Dutch Americans, 1/3 got window seats. So, we calculate how many Dutch Americans got window seats:
\[ \text{Number of Dutch Americans who got window seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows is 9.
