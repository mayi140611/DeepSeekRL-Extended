system
60% of the 200 employees drive to work, which is 200 * 0.60 = 120 employees. The remaining employees who don't drive to work are 200 - 120 = 80 employees. Half of the employees who don't drive take public transportation, which is 80 / 2 = 40 employees. 120 - 40 = 80 more employees drive to work than take public transportation.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####


system
The company has 200 employees. 60% of the employees drive to work, so there are \( 200 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \) employees who drive to work.

Of the 120 employees who drive to work, the remaining \( 120 - (200 - 120) \) do not drive, so there are \( 200 - 120 = 80 \) employees who do not drive to work. Half of this group takes public transportation, so \( 80 \times \frac{1}{2} = 40 \) employees take public transportation.

The difference is \( 120 - 40 = 80 \).
