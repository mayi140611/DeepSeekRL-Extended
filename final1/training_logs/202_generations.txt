#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Initially, Susie has $200. If she puts 20% more money into her piggy bank, we first calculate 20% of $200 to find out how much this increase is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 200 = \frac{20}{100} \times 200 = 0.2 \times 200 = 40 \]

Now, we add this amount to the original $200 to find the total amount Susie will have:
\[ 200 + 40 = 240 \]

Susie will have 20% more money than she currently has, which is $200.

20% of $200 is:
\( 20 \times \frac{200}{100} = 20 \times 2 = $40 \)

Now, add this to the original $200:
\( 200 + $40 = $240 \)

Currently, Susie has $200. If she puts 20% more money into her piggy bank, we need to calculate 20% of $200 first. 

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$200 = 0.20 \times 200 = \$40 \]

Then we add this amount to her current amount.

\[ \$200 + \$40 = \$240 \]
