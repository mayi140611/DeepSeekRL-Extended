###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Caleb and Cynthia are filling up their inflatable pool with water using buckets. They fill their buckets at the spigot and carry them to the pool. Caleb can add 7 gallons from his bucket and Cynthia can add 8 gallons from her bucket each trip. It will take 105 gallons to fill the pool. How many trips will it take for Caleb and Cynthia to fill the pool with their buckets?

Let's denote the number of trips Caleb makes by \( C \) and the number of trips Cynthia makes by \( Y \). From the problem, we know two things:

1. Caleb can add 7 gallons per trip and Cynthia can add 8 gallons per trip.
2. They need to fill a pool that holds 105 gallons.

From each trip Caleb does, 7 gallons are added to the pool, and from each trip Cynthia does, 8 gallons are added to the pool. So, in total, 7C + 8Y gallons are added to the pool per trip combined.

Since the pool holds 105 gallons:
\[ 7C + 8Y = 105 \]

We also know that \( C \) and \( Y \) must be whole numbers because they can't make fractional trips.

To determine how many trips it will take for Caleb and Cynthia to fill the pool, we need an equation where the total number of trips \( (C + Y) \) equals the total gallons of water needed:

\[ 7C + 8Y = 105 \]

Now, let's solve this equation to find pairs of integers \( (C, Y) \) that satisfy this equation.

Testing different values for \( C \):

- If \( C = 0 \):
\[ 7(0) + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 8Y = 105 \] (No integer solution)

- If \( C = 1 \):
\[ 7(1) + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 8Y = 105 - 7 \]
\[ 8Y = 98 \]
\[ Y = 12.25 \] (Not an integer)

- If \( C = 2 \):
\[ 7(2) + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 14 + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 8Y = 105 - 14 \]
\[ 8Y = 91 \] (No integer solution)

- If \( C = 3 \):
\[ 7(3) + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 21 + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 8Y = 105 - 21 \]
\[ 8Y = 84 \]
\[ Y = 10.5 \] (Not an integer)

- If \( C = 4 \):
\[ 7(4) + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 28 + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 8Y = 105 - 28 \]
\[ 8Y = 77 \] (No integer solution)

- If \( C = 5 \):
\[ 7(5) + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 35 + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 8Y = 105 - 35 \]
\[ 8Y = 70 \]
\[ Y = 8.75 \] (Not an integer)

- If \( C = 6 \):
\[ 7(6) + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 42 + 8Y = 105 \]
\[ 8Y = 105 - 42 \]
\[ 8Y = 63 \] (No integer solution)

Let's denote the number of trips Caleb makes as \( C \) and the number of trips Cynthia makes as \( Y \). Since they are working together, the total amount of water added by both can be represented as the sum of the water added by Caleb and Cynthia, which is given by the equation: 
\[ 7C + 8Y = 105 \]
This represents the total amount of water in gallons that fills the pool. Now, we need to find the value of \( C + Y \) which will tell us how many trips happen in total. 

Let's solve this equation to find the values of \( C \) and \( Y \).

First, multiply the equation by 7 to make the coefficients of \( C \) and \( Y \) match:
\[ 7(7C + 8Y) = 7(105) \]
\[ 49C + 56Y = 735\]

Substituting values:
\[ 49C + 56Y = 735 \]

Because \( C \) and \( Y \) are positive integers, we can iterate through possible values of \( C \) and figure out the associated \( Y \):
Let's solve it step by step:
For \( C = 1 \):
\[ 49 * (1) + 56 * (Y) = 735 \]
\[ 49 + 56Y = 735 \]
\[ 56Y = 735 - 49 \]
\[ 56Y = 686 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

This value of \( C \) produces a valid solution:

Let's verify:
When \( C = 1 \), \( Y = 12 \):
\[ 7 * 1 + 8 * 12 = 7 + 96 \]
\[ = 103 \]
This is not equal to 105, so let's check the next possible solution, \( C = 2 \):

For \( C = 2 \):
\[ 49 * (2) + 56 * (Y) = 735 \]
\[ 98 + 56Y = 735 \]
\[ 56Y = 735 - 98 \]
\[ 56Y = 637 \]
\[ Y = 11.5 \]

Since \( Y \) must be a whole number, we cannot accept the solution for \( C = 2 \).

Finally, when \( C = 1 \) and \( Y = 12 \):

\[ 7 * 1 + 8 * 12 = 7 + 96 \]
\[ = 103 \]
\( C \) and \( Y \) do not satisfy the equation.

Finally, let's check the other possible values.

For \( C = 2 \):
\[ 49 * (2) + 56 * (Y) = 735 \]
\[ 98 + 56Y = 735 \]
\[ 56Y = 735 - 98 \]
\[ 56Y = 637 \]
\[ Y = 11.5 \]

Since \( Y \) must be a whole number, we cannot accept the solution.

For \( C = 3 \):
\[ 49 * (3) + 56 * (Y) = 735 \]
\[ 147 + 56Y = 735 \]
\[ 56Y = 735 -

To determine how many trips Caleb and Cynthia need to fill the pool, we first need to find the combined capacity of their buckets. Caleb can add 7 gallons per trip, and Cynthia can add 8 gallons per trip. Therefore, together they can add \( 7 + 8 = 15 \) gallons per trip.

Next, we need to figure out how many trips will be required to fill a pool that holds 105 gallons. Since they can add 15 gallons per trip, we divide the total number of gallons needed to fill the pool by the number of gallons they can add per trip:
\[
\frac{105 \text{ gallons}}{15 \text{ gallons/trip}} = 7 \text{ trips}

Therefore, Caleb and Cynthia will need 7 trips to fill the pool.

Let's denote the number of trips Caleb makes as \( C \) and the number of trips Cynthia makes as \( Y \). Each trip, Caleb adds 7 gallons and Cynthia adds 8 gallons. The total amount of water added by both of them is 105 gallons. Therefore, the equation representing the total water added is:
\[ 7C + 8Y = 105 \]

Since they both make trips to the pool, we also know that:
\[ C + Y = \text{total trips} \]

To find the total number of trips, we need to find integer values for \( C \) and \( Y \) that satisfy both equations.

Let's solve the first equation for \( Y \):
\[ Y = \frac{105 - 7C}{8} \]

For \( Y \) to be a whole number, \( 105 - 7C \) must be divisible by 8. Let's test values of \( C \):
- If \( C = 0 \), \( Y = \frac{105}{8} \) (not a whole number)
- If \( C = 1 \), \( Y = \frac{98}{8} \) (not a whole number)
- If \( C = 2 \), \( Y = \frac{91}{8} \) (not a whole number)
- If \( C = 3 \), \( Y = \frac{84}{8} = 10.5 \) (not a whole number)
- If \( C = 4 \), \( Y = \frac{77}{8} \) (not a whole number)
- If \( C = 5 \), \( Y = \frac{70}{8} = 8.75 \) (not a whole number)
- If \( C = 6 \), \( Y = \frac{63}{8} \) (not a whole number)
- If \( C = 7 \), \( Y = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \) (a whole number)

If \( C = 7 \) and \( Y = 7 \), then:
\[ 7(7) + 8(7) = 49 + 56 = 105 \]
This satisfies both the equation for the total amount of water and the total number of trips. Therefore, Caleb and Cynthia must make 7 trips from each, so the total number of trips is 7.

Let's denote the number of trips Caleb makes as \( C \) and the number of trips Cynthia makes as \( P \). In each trip, Caleb and Cynthia together can add \( 7 + 8 = 15 \) gallons of water to the pool.

The total volume of water to fill the pool is 105 gallons. Since they together can add 15 gallons per trip, the combination of their trips will add \( 15 \) gallons per trip to the total volume.

The equation representing this situation is:
\[
15(C + P) = 105
\]
To find the number of trips, we need to solve for \( C + P \):
\[
C + P = \frac{105}{15} = 7
\]
This equation tells us that Caleb and Cynthia together need 7 trips to fill the pool.

However, since we need to find the individual number of trips \( C \) and \( P \), we can assume that they might take these trips in different sequences, so we need to solve for the individual values as well. Given:
\[
\text{Caleb's trips: } C = x, \text{ Cynthia's trips: } P = y
\]
With \( C + P = 7 \), we have two unknowns but only one equation. Let's assume they start together and then go in separate sequences:

If we consider \( C \) and \( P \) as integer values, the simplest solution where they start together and then take turns would be that Cynthia makes the last trip after Caleb. This means:
\[
P = 7
\]
Hence, \( C + P = 7 \). 
If Cynthia makes 7 trips, Caleb must have made \( C = 0 \) trips, assuming they start together.

So, one possible scenario is:
- \( C = 0 \) and \( P = 7 \) — This assumes they start together and Cynthia takes all 7 trips.

Therefore, the number of trips each individual makes is as follows:
- Caleb's trips = 0 trips
- Cynthia's trips = 7 trips

Thus, Caleb makes 0 trips and Cynthia makes 7 trips to fill the pool.

Let's denote the number of trips Caleb takes as \( C \) and the number of trips Cynthia takes as \( Y \). Since they fill the pool simultaneously, the total number of buckets filled is equal to the total gallons filled, which is \( C + Y \). The total gallons Caleb fills per trip is 7, and the total gallons Cynthia fills per trip is 8. Together, they can fill a total of \( 7 + 8 = 15 \) gallons per trip.

The total amount of water needed to fill the pool is 105 gallons. Therefore, the equation representing the total amount of water is:
\[ 15C + 15Y = 105 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing each term by 15:
\[ C + Y = 7 \]

Now, we need to find out how many trips it takes for both Caleb and Cynthia to fill the pool. Since they start together and continue filling until the pool is full, we need to find \( C \) and \( Y \) such that their combined work equals 105 gallons. The simplest solution is when \( C = Y = 3 \) because this will satisfy the equation \( C + Y = 7 \).

So, it will take 3 trips for Caleb to fill the pool (since Caleb can fill 7 gallons per trip) and 3 trips for Cynthia to fill the pool (since Cynthia can fill 8 gallons per trip). 

Therefore, together they will need:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ trips} \]

So, it will take 6 trips for Caleb and Cynthia to fill the pool.
