To find out how many books Stu and Albert have in total, we can first calculate how many books Albert has. Since Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, we can multiply the number of books Stu has by 4.

So, Albert has \( 9 \times 4 = 36 \) books.

Now, to find the total number of books Stu and Albert have together, we add their individual book counts:

Stu's books: 9
Albert's books: 36
Total books: \( 9 + 36 = 45 \)

So, Stu and Albert have 45 books in total.

To find out how many books Stu and Albert have in total, we first need to calculate how many books Albert has. Since Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, and Stu has 9 books, we can calculate the number of books Albert has as follows:

Albert's books = 4 * Stu's books
Albert's books = 4 * 9
Albert's books = 36

Now that we know Albert has 36 books, we can find the total number of books Stu and Albert have by adding their individual quantities together:

Total books = Stu's books + Albert's books
Total books = 9 + 36
Total books = 45

Therefore, Stu and Albert have a total of 45 books.

To find the total number of books Stu and Albert have, we first need to calculate how many books Albert has. Since Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, we can compute:

\[ \text{Albert's books} = 4 \times \text{Stu's books} = 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

Now that we know Albert has 36 books, we can add this to the number of books Stu has:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Stu's books} + \text{Albert's books} = 9 + 36 = 45 \]

So, Stu and Albert have a total of 45 books.

To find out how many books Albert has, you multiply Stu's number of books by 4: 
4 Ã— 9 = 36

Now, to find the total number of books that Stu and Albert have together, you add Stu's number of books and Albert's number of books:
9 + 36 = 45

So, Stu and Albert have 45 books in total.

First, we need to determine how many books Albert has. Since Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, we calculate \(4 \times 9\). Then, to find the total number of books both Stu and Albert have together, we add the number of books Stu has to the number of books Albert has.

After calculating these values, we will use Python code to perform the arithmetic calculation and find the final total.
