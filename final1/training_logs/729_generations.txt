Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The initial total number of seashells collected by the three of them is 59.
2. Henry collected 11 seashells.
3. Paul collected 24 seashells.
4. Let the number of seashells Leo initially collected be \( L \).

From the total initial collection, we can form the equation:
\[ 11 + 24 + L = 59 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ 35 + L = 59 \]
\[ L = 59 - 35 \]
\[ L = 24 \]

So, Leo initially collected 24 seashells.

Leo then gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid and keeps the rest for himself. A quarter of 24 is:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, Leo gave away 6 seashells and kept 18 seashells for himself.

Now, let's add up the final amounts:
- Henry: 11
- Paul: 24
- Leo: 18

Total number of seashells now:
\[ 11 + 24 + 18 = 53 \]

First, we need to determine the number of seashells collected by Henry and Paul. 

Henry collected 11 seashells, and Paul collected 24 seashells. Together, they collected 11 + 24 = 35 seashells. 

We are told that the initial total collection was 59 seashells. Therefore, the number of seashells collected by Leo is 59 - 35 = 24 seashells.

Leo then gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid. A quarter of Leo's 24 seashells is \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) seashells. 

So, Leo initially had 24 seashells and gave 6 to the younger kid. Thus, Leo now has \( 24 - 6 = 18 \) seashells.

Now, to find the total number of seashells they have in the end, we sum up the collections now:

- Henry: 11 seashells
- Paul: 24 seashells
- Leo: 18 seashells

The total is \( 11 + 24 + 18 = 53 \) seashells.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine how many seashells Leo initially collected:
   The total number of seashells collected by Henry, John, and Leo is 59.
   Henry collected 11 seashells.
   Paul collected 24 seashells.
   So, Leo's collection is 59 - 11 - 24 = 24 seashells.

2. Calculate the number of seashells Leo gave to the younger kid:
   Leo gave a quarter of his collection to the younger kid. 
   A quarter of 24 is \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) seashells.

3. Calculate the number of seashells Leo has left:
   After giving 6 seashells to the younger kid, Leo has \( 24 - 6 = 18 \) seashells left.

4. Calculate the total number of seashells they have now:
   Since no other information is provided about the number of seashells collected by John, we assume he didn't give any.
   So, the total number of seashells they have now is \( 59 + 18 = 77 \).

Therefore, the total number of seashells they have now is 77.

To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

1. First, let's find out how many seashells Leo initially collected. We know that the total number of seashells initially collected is 59, and Henry collected 11 and Paul collected 24. So, the total number of seashells collected by Leo, Henry, and Paul can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Total seashells collected by Leo plus Henry and Paul} = 59 - (11 + 24) = 59 - 35 = 24 \]

2. This means Leo initially collected 24 seashells.

3. Since Leo gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid, we need to calculate how many seashells that is:

\[ \text{Seashells given to younger kid} = \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \]

4. The number of seashells Leo has now is the initial amount minus the number he gave to the younger kid:

\[ \text{Leo's current seashells} = 24 - 6 = 18 \]

5. Now, to find the total number of seashells they have in total now, we add up the seashells collected by Henry, Paul, and Leo:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 11 + 24 + 18 = 53 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells they have now is 53.

First, we need to determine how many seashells Leo initially collected. We know that the total number of seashells collected by Paul, Henry, and Leo is 59. Henry collected 11 seashells and Paul collected 24 seashells. So, we can calculate the number of seashells Leo collected by subtracting the number of seashells collected by Henry and Paul from the total.

Leo's initial number of seashells = Total - (Henry's + Paul's)
Leo's initial number of seashells = 59 - (11 + 24)

Next, we need to calculate how many seashells Leo gave away. Since he gave away a quarter of his collection, we will calculate a quarter of Leo's initial number of seashells.

Seashells given away by Leo = Fraction given away (1/4) * Leo's initial number of seashells

Finally, we subtract the number of seashells given away by Leo from Leo's initial number of seashells to find out how many he has left.

Total number of seashells now = Leo's final number of seashells - Seashells given away by Leo

Let's do the calculations:
Leo's initial number of seashells = 59 - (11 + 24) = 59 - 35 = 24.
Seashells given away by Leo = 1/4 * 24 = 6.
Total number of seashells now = 24 - 6 = 18

So, the total number of seashells they have in total now is 18.

Let's start with the total number of seashells initially collected by Henry, John, and Leo. Henry collected 11 seashells, and Paul collected 24 seashells. Therefore, the total initially collected was 11 + 24 = 35 seashells.

They initially collected 59 seashells in total, so the number of seashells collected by Leo is 59 - 35 = 24 seashells.

Leo then gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid. So, Leo gave away 24 / 4 = 6 seashells.

The total number of seashells left with Leo is 24 - 6 = 18 seashells.

Now, to find the total number of seashells they have now, we add all the seashells up again, accounting for Leo's remaining seashells:
- Henry: 11
- Paul: 24
- Leo (remaining): 18
- Initial Paul: 24

The total is 11 + 24 + 18 + 24 = 77 seashells.

Let's break down the problem step by step. Initially, Henry and John collected seashells, and we are given that Henry collected 11 seashells and John collected 24 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells they initially collected together is \(11 + 24 = 35\). Given that the total number of seashells collected initially is 59, we can calculate how many seashells Leo collected initially. 
\[ 59 - 35 = 24 \]
So, Leo initially collected 24 seashells.

Leo then gave away a quarter of his collection to a younger kid. A quarter of Leo's collection is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \]
After giving away 6 seashells, Leo is left with:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Henry, John, and Leo collected some seashells. We know Henry collected 11, and Paul collected 24, and the total collection from all three was 59.

2. Let's denote:
   - Henry's collection as \( H \)
   - John's collection as \( J \)
   - Leo's collection as \( L \)

3. According to the information, we have:
   \[ H + J + L = 59 \]
   \[ H = 11 \]
   \[ J = 24 \]

4. Substituting \( H \) and \( J \) into the first equation:
   \[ 11 + 24 + L = 59 \]
   \[ 35 + L = 59 \]
   \[ L = 59 - 35 \]
   \[ L = 24 \]

5. So, initially, Leo collected 24 seashells.

6. Leo gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid. Therefore, Leo gave:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \]

7. After giving 6 seashells to the younger kid, Leo has:
   \[ 24 - 6 = 18 \]

8. Now, we need to find the total number of seashells they have now, which is the sum of the remaining collections of Henry, John, and Leo:
   \[ H + (J + \text{giving to the younger kid}) + L \]
   \[ 11 + (24 + 6) + 18 \]
   \[ 11 + 30 + 18 \]
   \[ 59 \]

So, they now have 59 seashells in total.

1. **Initial Collection Calculation:**

   Given the total collection initially is 59 seashells, we need to find out how many seashells each person collected. 

   - Henry collected 11 seashells.
   - Paul collected 24 seashells.
   - Let's denote Leo's collection as \( L \).

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**

   The sum of the seashells collected by Henry, Paul, and Leo should equal 59 seashells:
   \[
   11 + 24 + L = 59
   \]

   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   35 + L = 59
   \]

   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = 59 - 35 = 24
   \]

   So, Leo initially collected 24 seashells.

3. **Leo's Contribution to the Total:**

   Leo gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid. Therefore, Leo gave away:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \text{ seashells}
   \]

   The remaining seashells with Leo is:
   \[
   24 - 6 = 18 \text{ seashells}
   \]

4. **Final Collection:**

   Adding the number of seashells Leo has left and the unchanged number of seashells collected by Henry and Paul:
   \[
   18 + 11 + 24 = 53 \text{ seashells}
   \]

1. First, let's calculate how many seashells Leo collected initially. We know that the total number of seashells collected by Henry, John (not Paul), and Leo is 59. Henry collected 11 seashells and Paul collected 24 seashells. Therefore, the number of seashells Leo collected is:
   \[
   59 - 11 - 24 = 24
   \]

2. Next, we need to account for the fact that Leo gave away one quarter of his collection to a younger kid. So, we calculate a quarter of Leo's collection:
   \[
   \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]
   This means Leo gave away 6 seashells. Therefore, the number of seashells Leo has now is:
   \[
   24 - 6 = 18
   \]

3. Now, we add up the current number of seashells each person has:
   - Henry has 11 seashells.
   - Paul has 24 seashells.
   - Leo has 18 seashells.
   Adding these together gives:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of seashells Leo collected.
2. Calculate how many seashells Leo gave to the younger kid.
3. Subtract the given seashells from the initial total number of seashells and add the ones Leo gave to the younger kid to find the final total.

Let's start with step 1. We know that the total number of seashells collected by Henry, John, and Leo is 59. Henry collected 11 seashells and Paul collected 24 seashells. Using these information, we can find out the number of seashells Leo collected:

\[ \text{Number of seashells Leo collected} = \text{Total seashells} - (\text{Seashells collected by Henry} + \text{Seashells collected by Paul}) \]
\[ \text{Number of seashells Leo collected} = 59 - (11 + 24) \]
\[ \text{Number of seashells Leo collected} = 59 - 35 \]
\[ \text{Number of seashells Leo collected} = 24 \]

Now, let’s proceed to step 2 and calculate how many seashells Leo gave to the younger kid:

\[ \text{Number of seashells Leo gave to the younger kid} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Number of seashells Leo collected} \]
\[ \text{Number of seashells Leo gave to the younger kid} = \frac{1}{4} \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of seashells Leo gave to the younger kid} = 6 \]

Finally, for step 3, we will subtract the seashells Leo gave to the younger kid from the initial total number of seashells and add the ones he gave to the younger kid to find the final total:

\[ \text{Final total number of seashells} = \text{Initial total number of seashells} - \text{Number of seashells given to the younger kid} + \text{Number of seashells Leo gave to the younger kid} \]
\[ \text{Final total number of seashells} = 59 - 6 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Final total number of seashells} = 59 \]

So, the final total number of seashells they have now is 59.
