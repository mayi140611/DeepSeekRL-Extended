###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Javier is an Olympic javelin thrower.  In the last Olympics, he threw the javelin three times.  The first throw, he threw the javelin twice as far as he threw the javelin on his second throw, but only half as far as he threw it the third throw.  If the sum of all three throws was 1050 meters, then how far, in meters, did he throw the javelin on his first throw?

Let's denote the distance of the second throw as \( x \) meters. According to the problem:

- The first throw (Javier's first throw) is twice as far as the second throw, so the first throw distance is \( 2x \) meters.
- The first throw is half as far as the third throw, so the third throw distance is \( 4x \) meters.

The sum of all three throws is 1050 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[
2x + x + 4x = 1050
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
7x = 1050
\]

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 7:
\[
x = \frac{1050}{7} = 150
\]

So the distance of the second throw is 150 meters. Since the first throw is twice the distance of the second throw:
\[
\text{First throw distance} = 2x = 2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ meters}
\]

The distance of the third throw is four times the second throw:
\[
4x = 4 \times 150 = 600 \text{ meters}
\]

We can verify that the sum of all three throws is \( 300 + 150 + 600 = 1050 \) meters. 

Therefore, the first throw distance is 300 meters.

Let's denote the distance of the second throw as \( D_2 \).

According to the given information:
1. The first throw is twice as far as the second throw, so the first throw distance \( D_1 \) is \( 2D_2 \).
2. The first throw is half as far as the third throw, so the third throw distance \( D_3 \) is \( 2D_1 = 2(2D_2) = 4D_2 \).

We are also given that the sum of all three throws is 1050 meters:
\[ D_1 + D_2 + D_3 = 1050 \]

Substituting \( D_1 \) and \( D_3 \) in terms of \( D_2 \):
\[ 2D_2 + D_2 + 4D_2 = 1050 \]
\[ 7D_2 = 1050 \]
\[ D_2 = \frac{1050}{7} \]
\[ D_2 = 150 \]

The distance of the first throw \( D_1 \) is:
\[ D_1 = 2D_2 = 2 \times 150 = 300 \] meters.

Therefore, Javier threw the javelin 300 meters on his first throw.

Let's denote the distance of the second throw by $x$ meters. According to the problem:
- The first throw's distance is twice that of the second throw, so it's $2x$ meters.
- The first throw's distance is half that of the third throw, so it's $2 \cdot \text{(third throw's distance)}$.

Let the third throw's distance be $y$ meters. From this, we have:
\[2x + x + y = 1050\]

We need to solve for $y$, the distance of the third throw. 
\[ \text{We know that } 2x = x \cdot 2 \implies 2y = y \cdot 2 \implies y = 2y \text{}
\]

Thus, the third throw is twice the same as the second throw (this seems incorrect as it should be the same as the second), so we must set 
\[\text{Third throw} = x = 2x + y,\]

So, substituting this back in, we have:
\[2x + x + 2x + y = 1050\]
\[5x + y = 1050\] 

Also, from the problem statement, since the total is 1050 meters, the first throw distance $2x$ should be:
\[2x + x + 2x + y = 5x + 2x + y = 1050\]

Finally, solving these equations gives us:
\[7x + y = 1050\]
\[5x + y = 1050\]

Subtracting the second from the first:
\[2x = 0\]
\[x = 1050\]

Since $2x = 1050$ is incorrect, we must double check our assumptions. 

Assuming the second solution is correct, substituting $x = 1050$ into $5x + y = 1050$ gives us:
\[5(1050) + y = 1050\]
\[y = 1050 - (5 \cdot 1050)\]
\[y = 1050 - 5250\]
\[y = -4200\]

This is incorrect; the sum must be equal to 1050.
Therefore:
\[ \text{First throw } 2x = x \cdot 2 = 2x = 315.\]

Therefore:
\[ 2x = 315, \quad \text{so} \quad x = 157.5. \]

So, the first throw distance is $2 \cdot 157.5 = 315$ meters.

Let's denote the distance of the second throw as \( d \) meters. According to the problem, the first throw was twice as far as the second throw, so it was \( 2d \) meters. The third throw was twice as far as the first throw, so it was \( 2 \times 2d = 4d \) meters.

The sum of all three throws is given as 1050 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2d + d + 4d = 1050 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7d = 1050 \]

Solve for \( d \):
\[ d = \frac{1050}{7} = 150 \]

Now, we know the second throw distance \( d \) is 150 meters. The first throw is twice this distance:
\[ 2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ meters} \]

The third throw is also 150 meters, but because of the condition that it is half as far as the first throw, it actually is half of 300 meters:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ meters} \]

So the distances of the throws are:
- First throw = 300 meters
- Second throw = 150 meters
- Third throw = 150 meters

Therefore, Javier threw the javelin 300 meters in the first throw.

Let's define the distance of Javier's third throw as \( x \) meters. According to the problem, his first throw was twice as far as the second throw, so we can represent the distance of the second throw as \( \frac{x}{2} \) meters. Additionally, his first throw was half as far as his third throw, so we can represent the distance of the first throw as \( \frac{x}{4} \) meters (since half of \( x \) is \( \frac{x}{2} \)).

The sum of all three throws is given as 1050 meters:
\[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{x}{2} + x = 1050 \]

To simplify the equation, we can convert all terms to have a common denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{2x}{4} + \frac{4x}{4} = 1050 \]
\[ \frac{x + 2x + 4x}{4} = 1050 \]
\[ \frac{7x}{4} = 1050 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 and then dividing by 7:
\[ 7x = 4200 \]
\[ x = \frac{4200}{7} \]
\[ x = 600 \]

So the third throw distance \( x \) is 600 meters. The first throw distance was \( \frac{x}{4} \), which is:
\[ \frac{600}{4} = 150 \]

Therefore,
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 150 \]

The first throw distance is 150 meters.

Let's denote the distance of the second throw as \( x \) meters.

From the problem, we know:
1. The distance of the first throw is twice the distance of the second throw, so it is \( 2x \) meters.
2. The distance of the first throw is also half the distance of the third throw, so it is \( \frac{x}{2} \) meters.

The sum of all three distances is 1050 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2x + x + \frac{x}{2} = 1050 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x + \frac{x}{2} = 1050 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first convert \( 3x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[ 3x = \frac{6x}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{6x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 1050 \]

Combining the fractions:
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 1050 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 7x = 2100 \]
\[ x = \frac{2100}{7} \]
\[ x = 300 \]

So the second throw was 300 meters.

The first throw's distance is \( 2x \):
\[ 2 \cdot 300 = 600 \] meters.

Therefore, Javier threw the javelin 600 meters on his first throw.

Let's denote the distance of Javier's second throw as \( x \) meters. Given that the first throw was twice the distance of the second throw and half the distance of the third throw, we can express the distances as follows:
- First throw: \( 2x \)
- Second throw: \( x \)
- Third throw: \( 2x \) (since it is twice the first throw)

The total distance of all three throws is given as 1050 meters. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + x + 2x = 1050 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 1050 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{1050}{5} = 210 \]

Since \( x \) is the distance of the second throw, the distance of the first throw (which is twice the distance of the second throw) is:

So, Javier threw the javelin 420 meters on his first throw.
