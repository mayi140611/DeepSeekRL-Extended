system
To determine how many weeks Oscar needs to train to reach a 20-mile run, we need to calculate the additional miles he needs to run to reach his goal and then divide that by the weekly increment.

Currently, Oscar has run 2 miles, and he wants to run a total of 20 miles. Therefore, he needs to run:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Oscar plans to add \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a mile each week. To find out how many weeks it will take him to add the additional 18 miles:

\[ 18 \text{ miles} \div \frac{2}{3} \text{ mile per week} \]

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:

\[ 18 \div \frac{2}{3} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} \]

\[ = 18 \times 1.5 \]

\[ = 27 \]

So, Oscar needs to train for 27 weeks.

To determine how many weeks Oscar should start training, we first need to calculate the total additional distance he needs to cover before reaching the 20-mile mark.

He has already run 2 miles, so the remaining distance he needs to run is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to cover these 18 miles, given that he adds \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a mile each week.

We can set up the following equation to find the number of weeks, \( w \), it will take him:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times w = 18 \]

To solve for \( w \), we first isolate \( w \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \(\frac{2}{3}\):
\[ w = \frac{18}{\frac{2}{3}} = 18 \div \frac{2}{3} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Oscar needs 27 weeks to cover the remaining 18 miles.

Now, we need to determine how many weeks before the marathon he should start training. Since he already has 2 miles under his belt, we subtract these 2 miles from the total number of weeks he needs to train.

Therefore, the number of weeks before the marathon he should start training is:
\[ 27 - 2 = 25 \]

To determine how many weeks Oscar should start training, we need to calculate how many additional miles he needs to reach a total of 20 miles, after accounting for the miles he has already run. 

He has already run 2 miles, so he needs to run an additional \(20 - 2 = 18\) miles. According to his training plan, he plans to add \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week. Therefore, to find out how many weeks he needs to run \(18\) miles, we divide \(18\) by \( \frac{2}{3} \).

\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{18}{\frac{2}{3}} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

So, Oscar should start training \(27\) weeks before the marathon.

To determine how many weeks Oscar should start training, we need to calculate the total distance he needs to cover and then divide that by the distance he adds each week.

First, let's determine the total distance Oscar needs to cover:
- Oscar starts with 2 miles.
- He plans to add \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week.

The total distance he needs to cover is:
\[ 2 + \frac{2}{3} \]
To add these, we need a common denominator:
\[ 2 = \frac{6}{3} \]
So, the total distance is:
\[ \frac{6}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for Oscar to cover \( \frac{8}{3} \) miles if he adds \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week. We do this by dividing the total distance by the weekly addition:
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\frac{8}{3}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{8}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{8 \times 3}{3 \times 2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Oscar should start training 4 weeks before the marathon.

Oscar wants to train for a marathon by running 20 miles. He plans to add \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week, and he has already run 2 miles. We need to calculate how many weeks he should start training to reach a 20-mile run.

Since he has already run 2 miles, we need to determine how many additional miles he still needs to run to reach 20 miles:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Oscar plans to add \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week. To find out how many weeks it will take to run 18 miles, we divide the total number of miles needed by the weekly addition:
\[ 18 \text{ miles} \div \frac{2}{3} \text{ miles per week} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ weeks} \]

To determine the number of weeks Oscar should start training, we first need to calculate how many additional miles he needs to run to reach a 20-mile run from his current 2-mile run.

Total distance to run: 20 miles
Current distance: 2 miles
Distance to increase by: 20 - 2 = 18 miles

Oscar plans to increase his weekly distance by \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week. To find out how many weeks it will take him to increase his distance from 2 miles to 20 miles, we divide the total distance he needs to run by the weekly increase:

Number of weeks = Total distance to be achieved รท Weekly increase
Number of weeks = 18 miles รท \( \frac{2}{3} \) mile/week
Number of weeks = 18 รท \( \frac{2}{3} \)

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:

Number of weeks = 18 ร \( \frac{3}{2} \)
Number of weeks = \( \frac{18 \times 3}{2} \)
Number of weeks = \( \frac{54}{2} \)
Number of weeks = 27 weeks

To determine how many weeks Oscar should start training, we need to work backwards from the goal of running 20 miles. Let's denote the number of weeks as \( w \).

Oscar's plan is to add \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week. Therefore, after \( w \) weeks, he will have run \( 2 + \frac{2}{3}w \) miles. To reach his goal of 20 miles, we set up the equation:
\[ 2 + \frac{2}{3}w = 20 \]

Next, we solve for \( w \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}w = 20 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}w = 18 \]

To isolate \( w \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{3}{2} \):
\[ w = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ w = 27 \]

So, Oscar should start training 27 weeks before the marathon.

To determine how many weeks Oscar should start training, we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to reach a 20-mile run, given that he adds 2/3 of a mile each week and he has already run 2 miles. The total distance he needs to run is 20 miles, which means he needs to run an additional 18 miles (20 - 2 = 18).

The equation to find the number of weeks, \( w \), is:

\[ w \times \frac{2}{3} = 18 \]

To solve for \( w \), divide both sides by 2/3:

\[ w = 18 \div \frac{2}{3} \]

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:

\[ w = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} \]

Perform the multiplication:

\[ w = 18 \times 1.5 \]

\[ w = 27 \]

So, Oscar should start training 27 weeks before the marathon.

To determine how many weeks Oscar should start training, we need to calculate how much additional distance he needs to run to reach 20 miles.

1. **Current Distance**: Oscar has already run 2 miles.
2. **Target Distance**: He wants to run 20 miles in total.
3. **Remaining Distance**: Subtract the current distance from the target distance.
   \[
   20 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Weekly Increase**: Oscar plans to add \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a mile each week.

   To find out how many weeks it will take to cover the remaining 18 miles, we divide the remaining distance by the weekly increase.
   \[
   \frac{18 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ miles/week}} = 18 \text{ miles} \times \frac{3}{2} \text{ weeks/mile}
   \]
   \[
   18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \text{ weeks}

Therefore, Oscar should start training 27 weeks before the marathon.

To determine how many weeks Oscar needs to start training, we first need to find out how many additional miles he needs to run to reach his goal of 20 miles. This can be calculated by subtracting the miles he has already run from his goal.

Distance remaining = Goal distance - Miles already run
Distance remaining = 20 miles - 2 miles
Distance remaining = 18 miles

Next, we need to determine how many 2/3 of a mile increments Oscar needs to cover to reach his goal distance of 18 miles.

Number of weeks = Distance remaining / Daily mileage increment
Number of weeks = 18 miles / (2/3 mile per week)

To divide 18 miles by (2/3) of a mile per week, we multiply 18 by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2).

Number of weeks = 18 * (3/2)
Number of weeks = 9 * 3
Number of weeks = 27 weeks

Therefore, Oscar should start training 27 weeks before the marathon.
