Ludwig works on weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) and on a third day (Saturday or Sunday). We need to calculate his earnings based on his daily salary and the number of days he works each week.

Since his daily salary is $10 and he works half of the days off those days, we need to figure out his weekly work quantity and calculate his salary accordingly.

First, let's determine the number of days he works:
- Monday: 1 day
- Tuesday: 1 day
- Wednesday: 1 day
- Thursday: 1 day
- Friday: 1.5 days (half of 1 day)
- Saturday: 0.5 days
- Sunday: 0.5 days

The total number of working days in a week is:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 5 \]

Since his daily salary is $10, we can calculate his weekly salary:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Ludwig earns $50 every week.

Ludwig earns a full day's salary on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Friday, he works half of the day, so he earns half of the full day's salary. On Saturday and Sunday, he earns the full day's salary. 

So, we can calculate his weekly earnings as follows:
- On Monday to Thursday, he earns $10/day x 4 days = $40.
- On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he earns $10/2 + $10 + $10 = $20 + $10 + $10 = $40.

Total weekly earnings = $40 (Monday to Thursday) + $40 (Friday to Sunday) = $80.

Therefore, Ludwig earns $80 every week.

Ludwig works 7 days a week. Out of these, he works half of the day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, which means he works full days on Monday to Thursday and half days on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 

The calculation can be done as follows:
1. On Monday to Thursday, he works full days, so he earns 3 full days at $10 each, which is 3 * $10 = $30.
2. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he works half days, which means he earns half of $10, i.e., $10 / 2 = $5. So, for 3 half days, he earns a total of 3 * $5 = $15.

Adding these two amounts together, his total weekly earnings are $30 + $15 = $45.

Therefore, Ludwig earns $45 every week.

Ludwig works half of the day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, so he works 1/2 of his usual 8-hour day (or 4 hours) on those days. This leaves him with 4 hours of work on each weekday (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday).

His total work hours in a week are calculated as follows:
- Monday to Thursday: 4 hours/day * 4 days = 16 hours
- Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 4 hours/day * 3 days = 12 hours

Total work hours in a week = 16 hours + 12 hours = 28 hours

Since his daily salary is $10, his weekly earning is his total work hours multiplied by his daily salary:
weekly earnings = 28 hours * $10/hour = $280

Ludwig works 7 days a week. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he works half of the day, which means he works 3.5 hours of work per day for those three days. Therefore, for those three days, he works 3.5 * 3 = 10.5 hours in total. 

On the other days (Monday through Thursday and Tuesday), he works a full day, which is 8 hours. So, for those four days, he works 8 * 4 = 32 hours.

In total, over the week, he works 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 + 8 * 4 = 10.5 + 32 = 42.5 hours.

This is equivalent to 42.5 / 8 = $6.445 every hour, and 6.445 * 42.5 = $271.08. 

His total weekly earnings are $271.08.

To calculate Ludwig's weekly earnings, we need to determine how many days he works each week and then multiply that by his daily salary.

Ludwig works 7 days a week. However, during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he works only half a day each day, as he usually works half of the day on these days.

So, for the first 3 days (Monday to Wednesday), he works a full day (8 hours), which means his daily salary is $10.

For the next 3 days (Thursday to Saturday), he works half a day each, which means he earns $5 for these 2 days (since his salary is $10 per full day).

For the last 3 days (Sunday to Tuesday), he works half a day each, which again means he earns $5 for these 2 days.

Therefore, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:
- Monday to Wednesday: 3 days * $10/day = $30
- Thursday to Saturday: 2 days * $5/day = $10
- Sunday to Tuesday: 2 days * $5/day = $10

Total weekly earnings = $30 + $10 + $10 = $50

So, Ludwig earns $50 every week.

Ludwig works 7 days a week. During these days, he works half of the day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and the full day on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Let's calculate his earnings for the weekdays: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. 
- He earns $10 per day from Monday to Friday = $10/day * 5 days = $50.

Now, let's calculate his earnings for the weekend:
- He earns $10 per day for each of the weekend days.
- Friday is half of his day, and Saturday and Sunday are full days.
- Therefore, his earnings for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday = $10/day * 3 days * 1.5 = $45.

Adding his earnings on weekdays and weekends, we have:
- Total earnings for the weekdays = $50
- Total earnings for the weekend = $45
- Total weekly earnings = $50 + $45 = $95.

Now, let's consider his full day earnings on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
- He earns $10 for the full day.
- He earns half of the day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, which is $10/2 = $5.
- For Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, combined his earnings on a full day and half day are $10 + $5 = $15.

Thus, his total earnings include the earnings on weekdays and also the full day + half day for his weekend is $95, and the full day and half day earnings on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday is $15, totaling $95 + $15 = $110 for the entire week.

Ludwig works 7 days a week. His regular working days are 5 days (Monday to Friday), and during these 5 days, he works a full day. However, on the remaining 2 days (Saturday, Sunday), he works half of the day.

First, let's calculate how much he earns in the 5 full days:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times \$10 \text{ per day} = \$50 \]

Next, let's determine how much he earns in the 2 half-day days:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \$10\right) = 2 \times \$5 = \$10 \]

Now, we can find out his total weekly earnings:
\[ \$50 \text{ (full days)} + \$10 \text{ (half days)} = \$60 \]

Thus, Ludwig earns \$60 every week.

To calculate Ludwig's weekly earnings, we need to break down his work schedule and earnings accordingly.

- Ludwig works 7 days a week.
- He works half of the day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. This means he works for half the usual 8-hour workday (which is 4 hours). So his hours on these days are \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) hours.
- On the other 4 days (Monday to Thursday), he works full days, so his hours are \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) hours.
- His total weekly hours are \( 12 + 32 = 44 \) hours.
- Since his daily salary is $10, his weekly earnings are \( 44 \times $10 = $440 \).

Therefore, Ludwig earns $440 every week.

To calculate Ludwig's weekly earnings, let's break down his daily work schedule first:

- Normal days (Monday to Thursday): He works 1 full day each.
- Days off (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday): On these days, he only works half a day.

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
1. For normal days (Monday to Thursday): \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
2. For half-day work on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays: \(3 \times \frac{10}{2} = 3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Adding both groups:
\[ 40 + 15 = 55 \]

Therefore, Ludwig earns $55 every week.

Ludwig's weekly work hours can be calculated as follows:

1. He works 7 days a week.
2. He works half of the day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, which means he works 6 hours (half of a regular day's 8-hour workday).
3. So for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he works \(3 \times 6 = 18\) hours.
4. He works the full 8-hour days (Monday to Thursday and Monday to Friday) normally, which gives \(4 \times 8 = 32\) hours.
5. Therefore, his weekly total working hours are \(18 + 32 = 50\) hours.

Since he earns $10 per week, his weekly earnings can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Number of Hours Worked} \times \text{Daily Salary} = 50 \times 10 = 500 \]

So, Ludwig earns $500 every week.

To calculate Ludwig's weekly earnings, we first need to determine how many days he actually works and how much he earns during the work days.

1. Ludwig works 7 days a week.
2. He works half the day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, which means he works for a full day on Monday through Thursday and on both days of the weekend.
3. Therefore, he works 4 full days and 2 half days each week.

Let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- On Monday through Thursday, he works 4 days at his daily salary of $10.
- On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he works half a day. Since his hourly rate of $10 still applies, we need to calculate what this represents in a half day.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the full days:
\[ 4 \text{ days} \times \$10 \text{ per day} = \$40 \]

Now, let's calculate his earnings for the half days:
\[ 2 \text{ half days} \times \$10 \text{ per half day} = \$20 \]

Adding these together gives his total weekly earnings:
\[ \$40 \text{ (full days)} + \$20 \text{ (half days)} = \$60 \]

Therefore, Ludwig earns $60 every week.

To determine Ludwig's weekly earnings, we first calculate his daily earnings for the weekdays (Monday to Thursday) since each of these days he works full days at a salary of $10.

\[ \text{Daily earnings for weekdays} = \text{Daily salary} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings for weekdays} = \$10 \times 3 = \$30 \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, acknowledging that these days include half-days. Since there are three such days:

\[ \text{Daily earnings for half-days} = \text{Daily salary for a full day} \times \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings for half-days} = \$10 \times \frac{1}{2} = \$5 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings for half-days} = \text{Daily earnings for half-days} \times \text{Number of half-days} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings for half-days} = \$5 \times 3 = \$15 \]

Now, we add the earnings from the weekdays and the half-days to find the total weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Total earnings for weekdays} + \text{Total earnings for half-days} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = \$30 + \$15 = \$45 \]

Therefore, Ludwig earns \$45 every week.

To calculate Ludwig's weekly earnings, we first need to determine how many days he works in a week.

- From Monday to Thursday, he works normally, so that's 4 days.
- On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he works half the day, which means 2.5 hours per day. Let's calculate his daily earnings for these days:

\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Daily Salary} \times \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = \$10 \times \frac{1}{2} = \$5 \]

- Now, let's sum up the total earnings for the week:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = (\text{Earnings from Monday to Thursday}) + (\text{Earnings on Friday} + \text{Earnings on Saturday} + \text{Earnings on Sunday}) \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = (4 \times \$10) + (3 \times \$5) \]

Ludwig works 7 days a week. During Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he works half of the day, which means he works 1.5 days in those three days. The remaining days, Monday through Thursday, he works a full day, which is 8 hours. So, we need to calculate the total number of working hours in a week.

- He works 1.5 days/five days * $10/day = 15 hours per week for the weekend.
- He works 4 days/five days * $10/day = 40 hours for the weekdays.

Total weekly earnings = 15 hours (weekend) + 40 hours (weekdays) = 55 hours.

To convert hours into dollars with his $10/day salary, we calculate total weekly income.
