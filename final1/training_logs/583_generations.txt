Let's break this down step by step:

1. Robin ate 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce.
2. She ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting, which means she ate 2 * 4 = 8 cupcakes with buttercream frosting.

Now, to find the total number of cupcakes she ate, we add the number of chocolate sauce cupcakes to the number of buttercream cupcakes:

4 (chocolate sauce) + 8 (buttercream frosting) = 12 cupcakes

Therefore, Robin ate 12 cupcakes in total.

To find out how many cupcakes Robin ate, we need to first determine the number of buttercream frosting cupcakes. According to the instruction, Robin ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting as those with chocolate sauce. Since she ate 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce, she ate \(4 \times 2 = 8\) cupcakes with buttercream frosting.

Now, we add the number of chocolate sauce cupcakes to the number of buttercream frosting cupcakes to find the total number of cupcakes Robin ate. So, the total is \(4 + 8 = 12\).

To determine how many cupcakes Robin ate, let's break down the information given:

1. Robin ate 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce.
2. She ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting as she did with chocolate sauce.

Since she ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting as the 4 cupcakes she ate with chocolate sauce:
2 * 4 = 8 cupcakes.

Now, to find the total number of cupcakes Robin ate, we add the two quantities together:

4 (chocolate sauce) + 8 (buttercream frosting) = 12 cupcakes.

Therefore, Robin ate a total of 12 cupcakes.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes Robin ate.

1. First, we know Robin ate 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce.
2. She also ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting. If we denote the number of buttercream cupcakes by \( x \), then:
   \[
   x = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
3. The total number of cupcakes Robin ate is the sum of the chocolate sauce cupcakes and the buttercream cupcakes:
   \[
   4 + 8 = 12
   \]

So, the total number of cupcakes Robin ate is 12.

The number of cupcakes with buttercream frosting is twice the number with chocolate sauce. So, if Robin ate 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce, then the number of buttercream cupcakes she ate is 4 * 2 = 8. The total number of cupcakes Robin ate is the sum of the chocolate sauce and buttercream cupcakes: 4 + 8 = 12 cupcakes.

To find out how many cupcakes Robin ate, we start by determining how many cupcakes she ate with buttercream frosting. Since she ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting as she ate with chocolate sauce, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Number of buttercream cupcakes} = 2 \times \text{Number of chocolate cupcakes} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, we add the number of chocolate cupcakes to the number of buttercream cupcakes to find the total number of cupcakes Robin ate.

\[ \text{Total cupcakes} = \text{Chocolate cupcakes} + \text{Buttercream cupcakes} = 4 + 8 = 12 \]

Therefore, Robin ate a total of 12 cupcakes.

To determine how many cupcakes Robin ate, we need to analyze the information provided in the problem step by step.

1. Robin ate four cupcakes with chocolate sauce.
2. She ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting as she did with chocolate sauce.
   - Since she ate four cupcakes with chocolate sauce, the number of cupcakes with buttercream frosting is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

Now, to find the total number of cupcakes Robin ate, we need to add the number of chocolate sauce cupcakes to the number of buttercream frosting cupcakes:

\[

To determine how many cupcakes Robin ate, we need to focus on the information provided in the question.

1. Robin ate four cupcakes with chocolate sauce.
2. She also ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting on her own.

First, let's find out how many cupcakes she ate with buttercream frosting. Since she ate twice as many with buttercream frosting as she did with chocolate sauce:

- Number of cupcakes with chocolate sauce = 4
- Number of cupcakes with buttercream frosting = 2 * Number of cupcakes with chocolate sauce = 2 * 4 = 8

Now let's add the two amounts together:

- Total cupcakes = Number of chocolate sauce cupcakes + Number of buttercream frosting cupcakes
- Total cupcakes = 4 + 8 = 12

Therefore, Robin ate 12 cupcakes in total.

To determine how many cupcakes Robin ate, we start by identifying the number of cupcakes with chocolate sauce she ate. According to the problem, Robin ate 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce.

Next, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes with buttercream frosting. The problem states that she ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting as she did with chocolate sauce. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]
So, Robin ate 8 cupcakes with buttercream frosting.

To find the total number of cupcakes Robin ate, we add the number of cupcakes with chocolate sauce to the number of cupcakes with buttercream frosting:
\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \]

Thus, the total number of cupcakes Robin ate is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]
