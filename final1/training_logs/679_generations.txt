<reasoning>
First, we calculate how much money Julia spends on the new game. Since she spends half of her $40, she spends \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) dollars. This leaves her with \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) dollars. Next, she spends a quarter of the remaining $20 on in-game purchases, which means she spends \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) dollars. After this spending, she has \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) dollars left.

Julia initially has $40. She spends half of it on a new game for her phone, which means she spends $40 / 2 = $20. After buying the game, she has $40 - $20 = $20 left.

Then, she spends a quarter of what she has left on in-game purchases. So she spends $20 / 4 = $5 on in-game purchases. After this, she has $20 - $5 = $15 left.

Therefore, the calculations show that Julia has $15 left.

First, let's determine how much money Julia spends on the new game. Since she starts with $40 and spends half of her money on the game, we calculate:

\[ \text{Amount spent on game} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \]

So, Julia has $20 left after buying the game. Next, she spends a quarter of the remaining amount on in-game purchases. The remaining money after buying the game is $20. To find out how much she spends on in-game purchases, we calculate:

\[ \text{Amount spent on in-game purchases} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

After spending $5 on in-game purchases, she has:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, Julia has $15 left.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Julia starts with $40. She spends half of her money on a new game. So, she spends:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the game, she has:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she spends a quarter of what she has left on in-game purchases. So, she spends:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

After the in-game purchases, she has:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julia has left is 15 dollars.

First, let's calculate how much Julia spends on the new game. Since she spends half of her money on it:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20
\]

This means she spends $20 on the new game.

Next, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying the game. We start with $40:

\[
40 - 20 = 20
\]

Now, she spends a quarter of this remaining amount on in-game purchases. So, she spends:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means she spends $5 on in-game purchases.

Finally, we subtract these expenses from what she had left after buying the game:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Julia has $15 left.

To determine how much money Julia has left, let's follow these steps:

1. Julia starts with $40.
2. She spends half of her money on a new game. So, she spends $40 * 0.5 = $20.
3. After buying the game, she has $40 - $20 = $20 left.
4. She then spends a quarter of the remaining money on in-game purchases. So, she spends $20 * 0.25 = $5.
5. After spending on in-game purchases, she has $20 - $5 = $15 left.

Therefore, the amount of money Julia has left is $15.

To determine how much money Julia has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on the new game.
2. Determine how much money she has left after buying the game.
3. Calculate the amount spent on in-game purchases from the remaining money.
4. Find out how much money she has left after making in-game purchases.

First, Julia spends half of her $40 on the new game:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]
So, she spends $20 on the new game.

Next, we subtract the cost of the game from her original amount to find out how much money she has left:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]
So, she has $20 left after buying the new game.

Then, she spends a quarter of her remaining $20 on in-game purchases:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]
So, she spends $5 on in-game purchases.

Finally, we subtract the cost of the in-game purchases from the remaining $20 to find the final amount of money she has left:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]
So, Julia has $15 left.
