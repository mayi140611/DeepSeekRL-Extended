###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Miriam spent 30 minutes doing laundry, 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom, a certain amount of time cleaning her room, and 40 minutes doing homework. If she spent a total of two hours on these tasks, how long, in minutes, did she spend cleaning her room?

#### ANS ####

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the time Miriam spent cleaning her room as \( x \) minutes.

We know the following times:
- Laundry: 30 minutes
- Cleaning the bathroom: 15 minutes
- Homework: 40 minutes
- Cleaning her room: \( x \) minutes

The total time spent on all tasks is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 40 = 120 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 85 + x = 120 \]
\[ x = 120 - 85 \]
\[ x = 35 \]

So, Miriam spent 35 minutes cleaning her room.

system
Let's denote the time Miriam spent cleaning her room as \( x \) minutes.

The total time spent on all tasks is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

The total time spent on laundry, cleaning the bathroom, cleaning her room, and doing homework is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} + x \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} \]

According to the problem, the sum of these times is 120 minutes. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + x + 40 = 120 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 85 + x = 120 \]

To isolate \( x \), subtract 85 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 120 - 85 \]
\[ x = 35 \]

Therefore, Miriam spent \( 35 \) minutes cleaning her room.

Miriam spent 30 minutes on laundry, 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom, and 40 minutes doing homework. Let's denote the time spent cleaning her room as \( x \) minutes. The total time spent is the sum of all these activities, which equals 2 hours (or 120 minutes).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + x + 40 = 120 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 85 + x = 120 \]
\[ x = 120 - 85 \]
\[ x = 35 \]

To find out how long Miriam spent cleaning her room, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on the other tasks and subtract it from the total time she spent on all tasks.

Time spent on laundry: 30 minutes
Time spent cleaning the bathroom: 15 minutes
Time spent doing homework: 40 minutes

Total time spent on laundry, bathroom, and homework:
30 + 15 + 40 = 85 minutes

She spent a total of 2 hours on these tasks, which is equivalent to 120 minutes (2 * 60 minutes).

Time spent cleaning her room:
Total time - (Time on laundry + Time on bathroom + Time on homework)
= 120 - 85
= 35 minutes

Therefore, Miriam spent 35 minutes cleaning her room.

To find out how long Miriam spent cleaning her room, we need to subtract the time she spent on other activities from the total time she spent on all activities.

Total time spent: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time spent on laundry: 30 minutes
Time spent cleaning bathroom: 15 minutes
Time spent doing homework: 40 minutes

The time spent cleaning her room can be calculated as follows:

Total time - Time on other activities = Time spent cleaning her room

Let's calculate that:

120 minutes (total time) - 30 minutes (laundry) - 15 minutes (bathroom) - 40 minutes (homework) = 35 minutes

So, Miriam spent 35 minutes cleaning her room.

3. Homework: 40 minutes
4. Total time spent: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
5. Time spent cleaning her room: Let's call this time \( x \) minutes

The total time spent on all tasks can be calculated as the sum of the time spent on each task:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} + x \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

We can determine how much time Miriam spent cleaning by subtracting the time she spent on other tasks from the total time she spent on all tasks.

Total time spent: 2 hours = 120 minutes (2 * 60).
Time spent on laundry: 30 minutes.
Time spent cleaning the bathroom: 15 minutes.
Time spent doing homework: 40 minutes.

Calculation:
Total time = Time spent on laundry + Time spent cleaning bathroom + Time spent cleaning room + Time spent doing homework.
120 minutes = 30 minutes + 15 minutes + Time spent cleaning room + 40 minutes.

To find the time spent cleaning her room, we subtract the known times from the total time:
\[ \text{Time spent cleaning room} = 120 - 30 - 15 - 40 \]

Now, let's do the calculation:
\[ \text{Time spent cleaning room} = 120 - 85 = 35 \, \text{minutes} \]
