To determine the number of apples left in the basket by the end of the day, we need to calculate the number of apples removed by each person and then subtract the total from the initial number of apples.

1. Ricki removes 14 apples.
2. Samson removes twice as many apples as Ricki, which means Samson removes \(2 \times 14 = 28\) apples.
3. The total number of apples removed by both Ricki and Samson is \(14 + 28 = 42\) apples.
4. The initial number of apples in the basket is 74. After removing 42 apples, the number of apples left is \(74 - 42 = 32\).

So, there are 32 apples left in the basket by the end of the day.

To determine how many apples are left in the basket by the end of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples Samson removes. Since Samson removes twice as many apples as Ricki, and Ricki removes 14 apples, Samson removes \(2 \times 14 = 28\) apples.

2. The total number of apples removed by both Ricki and Samson is \(14 + 28 = 42\) apples.

3. Start with the initial number of apples, which is 74. Subtract the total number of apples removed, which is 42.

\( 74 - 42 = 32 \)

Therefore, there are 32 apples left in the basket by the end of the day.

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how many apples Samson removed from the basket. Since he removed twice as many apples as Ricki, he removed \(14 \times 2 = 28\) apples.

Next, we add the total number of apples removed by both Ricki and Samson to the initial number of apples in the basket. This gives us \(74 + 14 + 28 = 116\) apples removed.

Finally, we subtract the total number of apples removed from the initial number of apples to find the number of apples left in the basket by the end of the day. This is \(74 - 116 = -42\).

Since it's not possible to have a negative number of apples in the basket, this result suggests there might have been a mistake in the problem setup or interpretation. The initial number of apples (74) should be higher than the total number of apples removed (116) for a sensible outcome. 

However, based on the given numbers, if we ignore the negative result, approximately 62 apples would be left.

Initially, there are 74 apples in the basket. Ricki removes 14 apples, so we subtract 14 from the total. Then Samson removes twice as many as Ricki, which is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) apples. We subtract 28 from the remaining apples. So, the calculation is as follows:

\(74 - 14 - 28\)

First, subtract 14 from 74:

\(74 - 14 = 60\)

Then subtract 28 from 60:

\(60 - 28 = 32\)

So, the number of apples left in the basket is 32.

Ricki removes 14 apples from the basket. Samson then removes twice as many, so that's 14 * 2 = 28 apples.

The total number of apples removed is 14 + 28 = 42 apples.

Initially, there were 74 apples. After removing 42, the number left is 74 - 42 = 32 apples.

Ricki removes 14 apples from the basket. 
Samson removes twice as many as Ricki, which means \(2 \times 14 = 28\) apples.

The total number of apples removed by both Ricki and Samson is the sum of the apples removed by each: \(14 + 28 = 42\) apples.

The initial number of apples at the beginning of the day was 74. Subtracting the total number of apples removed by both Ricki and Samson gives us: \(74 - 42 = 32\) apples.

Therefore, there are 32 apples left in the basket by the end of the day.

2. Subtract the number of apples removed by Ricki.
3. Subtract the number of apples removed by Samson, which is twice the number removed by Ricki.

1. The starting number of apples is 74.
2. Ricki removes 14 apples.
3. Samson removes twice the number of apples removed by Ricki, so Samson removes \(2 \times 14 = 28\) apples.
4. The total number of apples removed by both Ricki and Samson is \(14 + 28 = 42\).
5. To find the number of apples left in the basket, subtract the total number of apples removed from the initial number of apples:
