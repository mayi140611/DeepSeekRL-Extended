###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

<reasoning>
Let's denote the age of Lavinia's daughter as \( D \) and the age of Katie's daughter as \( K \). According to the problem, \( K = 12 \) years.

Lavinia’s daughter is 10 years younger than Katie’s daughter, so:
\[ D = K - 10 \]
\[ D = 12 - 10 \]
\[ D = 2 \]

Lavinia’s son is 2 times the age of Katie’s daughter, so:
\[ S = 2 \times K \]
\[ S = 2 \times 12 \]
\[ S = 24 \]

Now, we need to find how many years older Lavinia’s son is than Lavinia’s daughter:
\[ S - D = 24 - 2 \]
\[ S - D = 22 \]

So, Lavinia’s son is 22 years older than Lavinia’s daughter.

To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the age of Katie's daughter:**
   Katie's daughter is 12 years old.

2. **Calculate Lavinia's daughter's age:**
   Lavinia’s daughter is 10 years younger than Katie's daughter.
   \( 12 - 10 = 2 \)
   So, Lavinia’s daughter is 2 years old.

3. **Calculate Lavinia's son's age:**
   Lavinia’s son is 2 times the age of Katie's daughter.
   \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)
   So, Lavinia’s son is 24 years old.

4. **Determine how many years older Lavinia's son is than Lavinia's daughter:**
   \( 24 - 2 = 22 \)

Therefore, Lavinia’s son is 22 years older than Lavinia’s daughter.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Katie's daughter is 12 years old.
2. Lavinia’s daughter is 10 years younger than Katie’s daughter, so Lavinia’s daughter = 12 - 10 = 2 years old.
3. Lavinia’s son is 2 times the age of Katie’s daughter, so Lavinia’s son = 2 * 12 = 24 years old.
4. To find out how many years older Lavinia’s son is than Lavinia’s daughter, we subtract the age of Lavinia’s daughter from the age of Lavinia’s son: 24 - 2 = 22 years.

Therefore, Lavinia’s son is 22 years older than Lavinia’s daughter.

1. First, find the age of Lavinia’s daughter. If Katie’s daughter is 12 years old, Lavinia’s daughter is 12 - 10 = 2 years older.
2. Next, find the age of Lavinia’s son. Lavinia’s son is 2 times the age of Katie’s daughter, so the son is 2 * 12 = 24 years old.
3. Finally, calculate how many years older Lavinia’s son is than Lavinia’s daughter. This can be found by subtracting the daughter's age from the son's age, which is 24 - 2 = 22 years.

So Lavinia’s son is 22 years older than Lavinia’s daughter.

Let's denote the age of Katie's daughter as Kd and the age of Lavinia's daughter as Lv.D. We are given that Kd = 12 years. 

We know that Ld = Kd - 10, so Ld = 12 - 10 = 2 years.

We also know that Ls = 2 * Kd, so Ls = 2 * 12 = 24 years.

The difference in age between Ls and Ld is Ls - Ld = 24 - 2 = 22 years.

So, Lavinia’s son is 22 years older than Lavinia’s daughter.

Let's define the ages:
- Katie's daughter = 12 years old
- Lavinia's daughter = Katie's daughter - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2 years old
- Katie's son = Let's denote it as Ks
- Lavinia's son = 2 * Katie's daughter = 2 * 12 = 24 years old

We need to find out how many years older Lavinia's son is than Lavinia's daughter. We do not have information about Katie's son's age directly, but we can calculate this from their relationship:

- Lavinia's son's age = 2 * Katie's daughter's age = 24 years.

Therefore, Lavinia's son is 22 years old, and Lavinia's daughter is 2 years old. The difference in their ages = Lavinia's son's age - Lavinia's daughter's age = 22 - 2 = 20 years.

The Lavinia’s son is 20 years older than Lavinia's daughter.

Let's denote the age of Katie's daughter as \( K_d \), the age of Lavinia's daughter as \( L_d \), and the age of Lavinia's son as \( L_s \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Lavinia’s daughter is 10 years younger than Katie’s daughter.
2. Lavinia’s son is 2 times the age of Katie’s daughter.

Given that Katie’s daughter is 12 years old, we can express these relationships as:
\[ L_d = K_d - 10 \]
\[ L_s = 2 \times K_d \]

First, substitute the value of \( K_d \) (which is 12) into the equations:
\[ L_d = 12 - 10 = 2 \]
\[ L_s = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find how many years older Lavinia’s son is than Lavinia’s daughter. This difference is given by:
\[ L_s - L_d = 24 - 2 = 22 \]

So, Lavinia’s son is 22 years older than Lavinia’s daughter.

Let's denote Katie's daughter as \( K_d \) and Lavinia's daughter as \( V_d \), and Lavinia's son as \( V_s \).

From the problem statement, we have:
1. \( K_d = 12 \) years old.
2. \( V_d = K_d - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2 \) years old.
3. \( V_s = 2 \times K_d = 2 \times 12 = 24 \) years old.

To find how many years older Lavinia's son is than Lavinia's daughter, we calculate:

Therefore, Lavinia's son is 22 years older than Lavinia's daughter.

Let's denote the age of Katie's daughter as \( K \) and the age of Lavinia's daughter as \( L \), and the age of Lavinia's son as \( S \).

According to the problem, we have:
1. \( L = K - 10 \) (Lavinia’s daughter is 10 years younger than Katie’s daughter). Since Katie’s daughter is 12 years old, \( K = 12 \).
2. \( S = 2K \) (Lavinia’s son is 2 times the age of Katie’s daughter). Since \( K = 12 \), \( S = 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

Now, we need to find how many years older Lavinia’s son is than Lavinia’s daughter:
\[ S - L = 24 - (12 - 10) = 24 - 2 = 22. \]
So, Lavinia’s son is 22 years older than Lavinia’s daughter.

Let's denote the ages of the people involved as follows:
- Katie's daughter is \( K_d = 12 \) years old.
- Lavinia's daughter is \( L_d = K_d - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2 \) years old.
- Katie's son is \( K_s \) years old.
- Lavinia's son is \( L_s = 2 \times K_s \) years old.

Since the problem doesn't provide the age of Katie's son, we cannot determine the exact age of Lavinia's son. However, we can express Lavinia's son's age in terms of Katie's son's age.

To find how many years older Lavinia's son is than Lavinia's daughter, we use the following formula:
\[ \text{Difference} = L_s - L_d = 2 \times K_s - 2 \]

Since the exact age of Katie's son is not given, we cannot calculate the numerical difference without additional information. Therefore, we can only express the difference in terms of the daughter's age.
