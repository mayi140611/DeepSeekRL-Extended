Susan is planning on having 30 guests. The recipe makes 2 servings per batch, so she needs 30/2 = 15 batches. Each batch requires 4 potatoes, so she will need 15*4 = 60 potatoes. Each potato costs $0.10, so she will spend 60*.10 = $6 on potatoes. Each batch requires 1 teaspoon of salt, so she will need 15*1 = 15 teaspoons of salt. Each container of salt has 5 teaspoons, so she will need 15/5 = 3 containers of salt. Each container of salt costs $2, so she will spend 3*2 = $6 on salt. In total, Susan will spend $6 on potatoes and $6 on salt, for a total of $12.

First, let's calculate the total number of servings needed: 30 guests x 2 servings/guest = 60 servings.
Next, we'll figure out how many batches of the recipe Susan needs to make: 60 servings / 2 servings/batch = 30 batches.
For potatoes, each batch requires 4 potatoes, so 30 batches x 4 potatoes/batch = 120 potatoes.
Since each potato costs $.10, Susan will spend 120 potatoes x $.10/potato = $12 on potatoes.
For salt, each batch calls for 1 teaspoon of salt, so 30 batches x 1 teaspoon/batch = 30 teaspoons.
Since each container of salt has 5 teaspoons, Susan will need 30 teaspoons / 5 teaspoons/container = 6 containers of salt.
Each container of salt costs $2, so Susan will spend 6 containers x $2/container = $12 on salt.
Therefore, Susan will spend a total of $12 + $12 = $24 on food.

To determine how much money Susan will spend on food, we need to calculate the number of batches required, the total number of potatoes and teaspoons of salt needed, and then find out the cost of the potatoes and salt.

First, we calculate the number of batches required. Susan has 30 guests and each batch makes 2 servings, so she needs:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{30 \text{ guests}}{2 \text{ servings per batch}} = 15 \text{ batches} \]

Each batch requires 4 potatoes. Therefore, the total number of potatoes needed is:

\[ \text{Total potatoes} = 15 \text{ batches} \times 4 \text{ potatoes per batch} = 60 \text{ potatoes} \]

Each potato costs $0.10, so the total cost for potatoes is:

\[ \text{Cost of potatoes} = 60 \text{ potatoes} \times \$0.10 \text{ per potato} = \$6.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total teaspoons of salt needed. Each batch calls for 1 teaspoon of salt and there are 15 batches, so the total teaspoons of salt needed is:

\[ \text{Total teaspoons of salt} = 15 \text{ batches} \times 1 \text{ teaspoon per batch} = 15 \text{ teaspoons} \]

Each container of salt has 5 teaspoons. Therefore, the number of containers of salt needed is:

\[ \text{Number of containers of salt} = \frac{15 \text{ teaspoons}}{5 \text{ teaspoons per container}} = 3 \text{ containers} \]

Each container of salt costs $2, so the total cost for salt is:

\[ \text{Cost of salt} = 3 \text{ containers} \times \$2 \text{ per container} = \$6.00 \]

Finally, the total cost for vegetables (potatoes and salt) is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of potatoes} + \text{Cost of salt} = \$6.00 + \$6.00 = \$12.00 \]

So, Susan will spend $12.00 on food.

First, we need to determine the total number of batches Susan needs to make to serve 30 guests. Each guest would have 2 servings, so 30 guests would require \(30 \times 2 = 60\) servings. Since each batch makes 2 servings, Susan needs \(60 / 2 = 30\) batches.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the potatoes. Each batch requires 4 potatoes, so for 30 batches, she needs \(30 \times 4 = 120\) potatoes. Each potato costs $0.10, so the total cost for potatoes is \(120 \times 0.10 = \$12\).

Then, we calculate the cost of the salt. Each batch requires 1 teaspoon of salt, so for 30 batches, she needs \(30 \times 1 = 30\) teaspoons of salt. Since each container has 5 teaspoons and costs $2, she will need \(30 / 5 = 6\) containers of salt. Therefore, the total cost for salt is \(6 \times 2 = \$12\).

Finally, we add the cost of potatoes and salt to find the total amount of money Susan will spend on food: \(12 + 12 = \$24\).

Susan needs to calculate the total amount of potatoes and salt she needs for 30 guests, given that each guest will eat either 1 or 2 servings of the recipe, and each batch needs 4 potatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt. First, let's figure out how many batches of the recipe are needed:
- For each guest: 2 servings * 4 potatoes = 8 potatoes per batch (1 guest) or 8*30 = 240 potatoes (30 guests).
- For each guest: 1 teaspoon of salt = 1 teaspoon per guest.
So, for 30 guests, we need 30 teaspoons of salt.
Also, if each container of salt has 5 teaspoons, then Susan will need 30/5 = 6 containers of salt.
Now, to calculate how much money she will spend on potatoes, we need to know if she needs to buy only potatoes or if she'll need to buy salt along with potatoes. Since we don't know the total number of potatoes needed, we'll assume she needs to buy only potatoes:
- Each potato costs $.10 and she needs 240 potatoes.
So, the total cost for potatoes will be 240 * $.10 = $24.
Therefore, the total cost for salt, given that she needs 6 containers, would be 6 * $2 = $12.
Thus, the total cost on food (potatoes and salt) will be $24 + $12 = $36.

To determine how much Susan will spend on food, we need to calculate the total number of servings she needs, the number of batches of the recipe required, and the cost of the potatoes and salt.

1. **Number of servings needed**: Since there are 30 guests and each guest will eat one batch of the recipe, Susan needs 30 servings.
2. **Number of batches needed**: Each batch makes 2 servings. Therefore, Susan needs \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) batches.
3. **Potatoes needed**: Each batch requires 4 potatoes. So, 15 batches will require \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) potatoes.
4. **Cost of potatoes**: Each potato costs $0.10. Thus, 60 potatoes will cost \( 60 \times 0.10 = \$6 \).
5. **Salt needed**: Each batch requires 1 teaspoon of salt. So, 15 batches will require \( 15 \) teaspoons of salt.
6. **Containers of salt needed**: Each container has 5 teaspoons. Therefore, Susan needs \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) containers of salt.
7. **Cost of salt**: Each container costs $2. So, the total cost for the salt is \( 3 \times 2 = \$6 \).

Finally, adding the cost of potatoes and salt together, the total amount Susan will spend on food is \( \$6 + \$6 = \$12 \).

First, we need to determine how many batches of the recipe Susan will need to serve 30 guests. Since the recipe makes 2 servings per batch, Susan will need $30 \div 2 = 15$ batches of the recipe.

Next, let's calculate the cost of potatoes and salt.

For potatoes:
15 batches * 4 potatoes per batch = 60 potatoes
Cost of 60 potatoes: 60 * $0.10 = $6

For salt:
15 batches * 1 teaspoon per batch = 15 teaspoons
Cost of 15 teaspoons of salt: 15 * $0.50 = $7.50 (since there are 5 teaspoons per container)

Adding the cost of potatoes and salt together:
$6 (potatoes) + $7.50 (salt) = $13.50

\( \frac{30 \text{ guests}}{2 \text{ servings per batch}} = 15 \text{ batches} \)

Now, let's determine the total amount of potatoes needed:

\( 15 \text{ batches} \times 4 \text{ potatoes per batch} = 60 \text{ potatoes} \)

Each potato costs $0.10, so the total cost for potatoes is:

\( 60 \text{ potatoes} \times $0.10 \text{ per potato} = $6 \)

Next, Susan needs 1 teaspoon of salt per serving. For 30 guests, she will need:

\( 1 \text{ teaspoon per serving} \times 30 \text{ guests} = 30 \text{ teaspoons of salt} \)

Each container of salt contains 5 teaspoons and costs $2. Therefore, the number of containers needed is:

\( \frac{30 \text{ teaspoons}}{5 \text{ teaspoons per container}} = 6 \text{ containers} \)

The cost for the salt is:

\( 6 \text{ containers} \times $2 \text{ per container} = $12 \)

Now, we add the cost of the potatoes and the salt to get the total cost:

\( $6 \text{ for potatoes} + $12 \text{ for salt} = $18 \)

So, the total amount Susan will spend on food is $18.

To determine how much money Susan will spend on food, we need to calculate the number of potatoes and salt she will need for 30 guests, and then find the total cost.

First, calculate the number of batches Susan needs:
\[
\frac{30 \text{ guests}}{2 \text{ servings per batch}} = 15 \text{ batches}
\]

Each batch requires 4 potatoes:
\[
15 \text{ batches} \times 4 \text{ potatoes per batch} = 60 \text{ potatoes}
\]

Each batch also requires 1 teaspoon of salt. Therefore:
\[
15 \text{ batches} \times 1 \text{ teaspoon per batch} = 15 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Next, calculate the cost of the potatoes:
\[
60 \text{ potatoes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars per potato} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, calculate the cost of the salt:
\[
15 \text{ teaspoons} \div 5 \text{ teaspoons per container} = 3 \text{ containers}
\]
\[
3 \text{ containers} \times 2 \text{ dollars per container} = 6 \text{ dollars}

Finally, add the costs of potatoes and salt to get the total amount spent:
\[
6 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}

First, we need to determine how many servings the recipe can provide and how many servings Susan needs. Since each 2-serving batch requires 4 potatoes, Susan will need 4 servings. 
To calculate how many containers of salt Susan will need, we need to find out how many servings are in a container of salt. Since each container contains 5 teaspoons and each batch requires 1 teaspoon, each container can provide 5 servings of salt. 
Therefore, 4 servings (2 batches) will require 0.8 containers of salt. Each container costs $2, so Susan will spend $1.60 on salt.
Next, we need to determine how many potatoes Susan will need. Since each batch requires 4 potatoes and she needs 2 servings, she will need 4 servings of potatoes. She can make 2 servings from 2 batches of the recipe, so she will need 2 servings of potatoes. 
At $0.10 per potato, Susan will spend $0.20 on potatoes.
Therefore, the total amount of money Susan will spend on food for the party will be $1.60 for the salt + $0.20 for the potatoes = $1.80.

To solve this, let's break down the ingredients each person will need:

For 30 people, the recipe makes 30 servings (30 guests * 2 servings per guest).
Each batch makes 2 servings. Therefore, Susan needs to make 15 batches (30 servings ÷ 2 servings per batch).

Each batch requires:
- 4 potatoes
- 1 teaspoon of salt

So let's calculate the ingredients required:
15 batches * 4 potatoes per batch = 60 potatoes
15 batches * 1 teaspoon of salt per batch = 15 teaspoons of salt

A potato costs $0.10, so 60 potatoes will cost 60 * $0.10 = $6.

A container of salt costs $2, and it has 5 teaspoons. Since Susan only needs 15 teaspoons, 3 containers will be sufficient (15 teaspoons ÷ 5 teaspoons per container = 3 containers).

Therefore, the cost for salt will be 3 containers * $2 per container = $6.

In total, Susan will spend $6 on potatoes + $6 on salt = $12.
