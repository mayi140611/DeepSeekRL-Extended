Michael initially has 4 packs of crayons. He wants to buy 2 more packs, which will increase his total number of packs to 4 + 2 = 6.

Each pack of crayons costs $2.5, so the total cost for the packs he will have after the purchase is 6 packs * $2.5/pack = $15.

Therefore, all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase are worth $15.

First, we need to find out how many packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase. He currently has 4 packs and wants to buy 2 more. So, the total number of packs he will have is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of these 6 packs. Since each pack of crayons costs $2.5, the total cost for 6 packs is:
\[ 6 \times 2.5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael currently has 4 packs of crayons. He wants to buy 2 more packs. If one pack costs $2.5, then two packs will cost 2 * $2.5 = $5. 

So the total number of packs Michael will have after the purchase is 4 + 2 = 6 packs.

To find the total value, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each pack costs $2.5, the total cost for 6 packs is 6 * $2.5 = $15.

Therefore, all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase is worth $15.

Michael currently has 4 packs of crayons. He wants to buy 2 more. First, we add the packs he already has to the packs he plans to buy: \(4 + 2 = 6\) packs. Each pack costs $2.5. To find the total worth of all the packs, we multiply the total number of packs by the cost per pack: \(6 \times 2.5 = 15\). Therefore, all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase are worth $15.

To determine the total worth of all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the worth of the 4 packs of crayons Michael already has.
2. Calculate the worth of the 2 packs of crayons he wants to buy.

Firstly, we find out the total worth of the 4 packs Michael already has. Each pack costs $2.5, so the total worth of these 4 packs is:
\[ 4 \times 2.5 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the total worth of the 2 packs he wants to buy. We do this by:
\[ 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \]

Now, we add these two amounts together to find the total worth of all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase is $15.

Michael currently has 4 packs of crayons. He wants to buy 2 more packs. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 packs of crayons:

\[
\text{Number of packs to be bought} = 2
\]
\[
\text{Cost per pack} = \$2.5
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for 2 packs} = 2 \times 2.5 = \$5
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of packs Michael will have:

\[
\text{Total packs Michael has initially} = 4
\]
\[
\text{Total packs to be bought} = 2
\]
\[
\text{Total number of packs Michael will have} = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Finally, we calculate the total worth of all the packs of crayons:

\[
\text{Total worth} = \text{Total number of packs} \times \text{Cost per pack}
\]
\[
\text{Total worth} = 6 \times 2.5 = \$15
\]

Therefore, the total worth of all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase is \$15.

Let's calculate the total number of packs Michael will have after the purchase. Michael currently has 4 packs and wants to buy 2 more, so he will have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 packs.

Now, each pack costs $2.5. To find the total value of all the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost of each pack. So, 6 packs * $2.5 per pack equals $15.

Therefore, all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase are worth $15.

To determine the total value of all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Current Value of Crayons:**
   Michael currently has 4 packs of crayons. Since each pack costs $2.5, the total value of the current crayons is:
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pack} = \$10
   \]

2. **Calculate the Value of the New Crayons:**
   Michael wants to buy 2 more packs of crayons. The value of these 2 packs is:
   \[
   2 \text{ packs} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pack} = \$5
   \]

3. **Calculate Total Value After Purchase:**
   Add the current value of the crayons to the value of the new packs:
   \[
   \$10 \text{ (current value)} + \$5 \text{ (new purchase)} = \$15
   \]

Thus, the total value of all the packs of crayons Michael will have after purchasing the extra 2 packs is $15.

Michael currently has 4 packs of crayons. He wants to buy 2 more packs, so he will end up with a total of \(4 + 2 = 6\) packs of crayons.

Each pack of crayons costs $2.5. Therefore, the total value of the crayons Michael will have after the purchase is \(6 \times 2.5\).

Let's calculate this:
\[
6 \times 2.5 = 15
\]

So, Michael's 6 packs of crayons will be worth $15.
