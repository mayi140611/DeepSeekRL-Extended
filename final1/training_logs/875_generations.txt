Jake amasses a fortune of 80 bitcoin.  He donates 20 bitcoins to charity.  He then gives half of all the bitcoins to his brother.  After that, he triples the number of bitcoins he has.  Then he donates another 10 coins.  How many coins does he have?

#### ANS ####

80
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
<reasoning>
After donating 20 bitcoins to charity, Jake has 80 - 20 = 60 bitcoins left. He gives half of his bitcoins to his brother, meaning he gives away 60/2 = 30 bitcoins. This leaves him with 60 - 30 = 30 bitcoins. He then triples the number of bitcoins he has, which means he now has 30 * 3 = 90 bitcoins.

Finally, he donates another 10 coins, leaving him with 90 - 10 = 80 bitcoins.

First, Jake starts with 80 bitcoins.

1. He donates 20 bitcoins to charity:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60
   \]
   So, he has 60 bitcoins left.

2. He gives half of his remaining bitcoins to his brother:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
   So, he has 60 - 30 = 30 bitcoins left.

3. He triples the number of bitcoins he has:
   \[
   30 \times 3 = 90
   \]
   So, he has 30 bitcoins after tripling.

4. He donates another 10 bitcoins:
   \[
   90 - 10 = 80
   \]
   So, he has 80 bitcoins after the last donation.

After calculating each step, we find that Jake has 80 bitcoins in the end.

To determine how many bitcoins Jake has after all the transactions, we will follow each step:

1. Jake starts with 80 bitcoins.
2. He donates 20 bitcoins to charity:
   \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) bitcoins
3. He gives half of the remaining bitcoins to his brother:
   \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) bitcoins
   \( 60 - 30 = 30 \) bitcoins
4. He triples the remaining bitcoins:
   \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) bitcoins
5. He donates another 10 bitcoins:
   \( 90 - 10 = 80 \) bitcoins

Therefore, Jake ends up with 80 bitcoins.

Let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. Jake starts with 80 bitcoins.
2. He donates 20 bitcoins to charity. Now he has \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) bitcoins.
3. He gives half of his remaining bitcoins to his brother. Half of 60 bitcoins is 30, so he gives away 30 bitcoins. Now he has \( 60 - 30 = 30 \) bitcoins.
4. He triples the number of bitcoins he has. So he multiplies 30 by 3 to get \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) bitcoins.
5. He donates another 10 bitcoins. Now he has \( 90 - 10 = 80 \) bitcoins.

So, after all these transactions, Jake has 80 bitcoins.

To determine how many coins Jake has after all the transactions, we need to follow the steps one by one.

1. **Initial fortune**: Jake starts with 80 bitcoins.
2. **Donation to charity**: Jake donates 20 bitcoins, so he has \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) bitcoins left.
3. **Giving to brother**: Jake gives half of his bitcoins to his brother. So, he gives \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) bitcoins, and he is left with \( 60 - 30 = 30 \) bitcoins.
4. **Tripling the bitcoins**: Jake triples the number of bitcoins he has. So, he has \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) bitcoins.
5. **Second donation**: Jake donates another 10 bitcoins, so he is left with \( 90 - 10 = 80 \) bitcoins.

Therefore, Jake has 80 bitcoins at the end.
