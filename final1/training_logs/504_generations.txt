The percentage of the sheep that are in the pen is 90%, so the percentage that are out in the wilderness is 10%. 

If 81 sheep are in the pen, we can calculate the original total number of sheep by dividing the number of sheep in the pen by the percentage in the pen:

\[
\text{Original total number of sheep} = \frac{81}{0.9}
\]

\[
\text{Original total number of sheep} = 90
\]

Since 10% of the total number of sheep wandered off, the number of sheep that wandered off is:

\[
\text{Number of sheep in the wilderness} = 0.10 \times 90
\]

\[
\text{Number of sheep in the wilderness} = 9
\]

To find out how many sheep are out in the wilderness, we first need to determine the total number of sheep Carla has. 

Given that 90% of her sheep are in the pen and there are 81 sheep there, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of sheep, \(N\):

\[ 0.9N = 81 \]

To solve for \(N\), we divide both sides by 0.9:

\[ N = \frac{81}{0.9} \]
\[ N = 90 \]

So, there are 90 sheep in total. 

Since 10% of the sheep wandered off into the hills, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 90 = 0.10 \times 90 \]
\[ = 9 \]

Therefore, 9 sheep are out in the wilderness.

Carla's sheepdog rounded up 90% of her sheep, which means 90% of the total number of sheep is 81. We can use this information to find the total number of sheep Carla had. The percentage of the total number of sheep that is in the pen is the total number of sheep in the pen divided by 100%, or \( \frac{81}{90} \).

1. First, set up the equation to find the total number of sheep, where \( T \) is the total number of sheep.
\[ \frac{81}{90} = \frac{T}{100} \]
From this, we can solve for \( T \) by cross-multiplying:
\[ 81 \times 100 = 90 \times T \]
\[ 8100 = 90T \]
\[ T = \frac{8100}{90} \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So Carla had 90 sheep in total. Since 90% of the sheep were in the pen, the remaining 10% are out in the wilderness:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 90 = 0.10 \times 90 \]

2. Calculate the number of sheep in the wilderness:
\[ 0.10 \times 90 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of sheep outside her pen is 9.

To find out how many sheep are in the wilderness, we first need to determine the total number of sheep Carla has. We know that 90% of the sheep are in the pen, and this 90% accounts for 81 sheep.

Let's use the formula to find the total number of sheep:

\[
0.9 \times \text{Total_Sheep} = 81
\]

Solving for Total_Sheep:

\[
\text{Total_Sheep} = \frac{81}{0.9}
\]

Now we calculate:

\[
\text{Total_Sheep} = 90
\]

So, Carla has 90 sheep in total.

To find the number of sheep out in the wilderness, we calculate 10% (which was not rounded up):

\[
0.1 \times \text{Total_Sheep} = 9
\]

Therefore, there are 9 sheep out in the wilderness.

To find out how many sheep are out in the wilderness, we start by determining the total number of sheep Carla has. We know that 90% of the sheep are in the pen, so the rest, which is 10%, are out in the wilderness.

Given that there are 81 sheep in the pen, we can find the total number of sheep (T) by using the fact that 81 represents 90% of the total.

\[0.9T = 81\]

Now we solve for T:
\[T = \frac{81}{0.9} = 90\]

So, Carla has a total of 90 sheep.

Next, since 10% of the sheep are out in the wilderness, we calculate the number of sheep out in the wilderness (S):

\[S = 0.1 \times T = 0.1 \times 90 = 9\]

Therefore, there are 9 sheep out in the wilderness.

To find out how many sheep are out in the wilderness, we need to first determine the total number of sheep Carla has. We know that 90% of the sheep are in the pen, and this number is 81.

We can set up the equation: \(0.9 \times \text{Total number of sheep} = 81\)

To solve for the total number of sheep, divide 81 by 0.9:

Total number of sheep = \(81 / 0.9 = 90\)

Now that we know the total number of sheep is 90, and we already have 81 sheep in the pen, the remaining sheep are out in the wilderness:

Number of sheep in the wilderness = Total number of sheep - Number of sheep in the pen
Number of sheep in the wilderness = 90 - 81
Number of sheep in the wilderness = 9

So, 9 sheep are out in the wilderness.

To determine how many sheep are out in the wilderness, we first need to find out how many sheep a 90% round-up implies. If 90% of the sheep are in the pen, then the remaining 10% must be wandering off into the wilderness. Since there are 81 sheep in the pen, this represents 90% of the total number of sheep, which means 10% must be the ones out in the wilderness. We can calculate the total number of sheep and then determine the number of sheep out in the wilderness.

Let's denote the total number of sheep as \( T \). We know that 90% of \( T \) equals 81. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.9 \times T = 81 \]

We can solve for \( T \) to find the total number of sheep:
\[ T = \frac{81}{0.9} \]

Then, we can find the number of sheep out in the wilderness, which is 10% of \( T \):
\[ 0.1 \times T \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( T \).

To find out how many sheep are out in the wilderness, we first need to determine the total number of sheep Carla has. We can do this by dividing the number of sheep in the pen by the percentage that were rounded up, since these are the sheep that are accounted for.

The number of sheep in the pen can be expressed as a percentage of the total number of sheep. Let's call the total number of sheep T. We know that 90% of T rounded up equals 81 sheep. So we can write:

0.90 * T = 81

Now, let's solve for T:

T = 81 / 0.90
T = 90

So, Carla has 90 sheep in total.

Since 10% of the sheep wandered off into the hills, we can find out how many are out in the wilderness by calculating 10% of 90.

10% of 90 = 0.10 * 90
10% of 90 = 9

Therefore, 9 sheep are out in the wilderness.

Carla's sheepdog rounded up 90% of her sheep, which means that the remaining 10% wandered off into the hills. If there are 81 sheep in the pen, this represents the 10% that wandered off.

Let's denote the total number of sheep (including those in the pen and those in the wilderness) as \( T \). The relationship between the total and the 10% that wandered off can be expressed as:
\[ 0.10 \times T = 81 \]

We need to solve for \( T \) to find the total number of sheep. Then, we can subtract the 81 sheep in the pen to find out how many are out in the wilderness.
</reasoning>
<answer>
\[ T = \frac{81}{0.10} \]
\[ T = 810 \]

Now we find the number of sheep out in the wilderness:
\[ \text{Number of sheep out in the wilderness} = T - 81 \]
\[ \text{Number of sheep out in the wilderness} = 810 - 81 \]
\[ \text{Number of sheep out in the wilderness} = 729 \]

There are 729 sheep out in the wilderness.

To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of sheep Carla has. Since 90% of the sheep are in the pen, we can find the total number of sheep by dividing the number of sheep in the pen by 90% (or 0.9).

Total number of sheep = Number of sheep in the pen / Percentage in the pen
Total number of sheep = 81 / 0.9
Total number of sheep = 90

Now we know Carla has 90 sheep in total. Since 10% of the sheep wandered off, we can calculate the number of sheep that wandered off by finding 10% of 90.

Number of sheep wandering off = 10% of total sheep
Number of sheep wandering off = 10/100 * 90
Number of sheep wandering off = 9

Therefore, 9 sheep wandered off into the wilderness.

Let's denote the total number of sheep by \( x \). According to the problem, Carla's sheepdog rounded up 90% of the sheep, which means that 10% of the sheep wandered off into the hills. Therefore, the number of sheep that wandered off is \( 0.1x \).

We know that the number of sheep in the pen is 81, which represents the 10% of the total number of sheep that wandered off. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 0.1x = 81 \]

To find the total number of sheep, \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.1:
\[ x = \frac{81}{0.1} = 810 \]

So, the total number of sheep is 810. Since 10% of the sheep wandered off, the number of sheep that are out in the wilderness is:

To find out how many of Carla's sheep are out in the wilderness, we first need to determine the total number of sheep Carla initially had.

Let \( T \) be the total number of sheep. Then:

To find \( T \), we can solve the equation:
