To determine the total number of candles Stephanie needs, let's break down the cupcakes that need decorations:

1. Half of the cupcakes are 1 candle each:
\[ \text{Half of } 24 = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]
So, 12 cupcakes need 1 candle each.

2. The other half of the cupcakes are 2 candles each:
\[ \text{The remaining } 12 \]
\[ \text{These cupcakes need } 2 \text{ candles each.} \]

Now, calculate the total number of candles needed:

For 12 cupcakes with 1 candle each:
\[ 12 \times 1 = 12 \]

For 12 cupcakes with 2 candles each:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Adding the additional candles:

\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Stephanie currently has 30 candles. To find out how many more she needs:

\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

Stephanie needs 6 additional candles to complete the cupcakes.

First, we need to determine how many cupcakes get 1 candle and how many get 2 candles. Since she wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each and the other half with 2 candles each, she plans to have 12 cupcakes with 1 candle each and 12 cupcakes with 2 candles each.

To calculate the total number of candles needed, we multiply the number of cupcakes in each group by the number of candles per cupcake:
- For the 12 cupcakes with 1 candle each: \(12 \times 1 = 12\) candles.
- For the 12 cupcakes with 2 candles each: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) candles.

So, the total number of candles needed for all the cupcakes is \(12 + 24 = 36\) candles.

Stephanie currently has 30 candles. To find out how many additional candles she needs, we subtract the number of candles she has from the total number of candles needed:
- \(36 \text{ candles needed} - 30 \text{ candles she already has} = 6 \text{ additional candles needed}\).

Therefore, Stephanie needs 6 additional candles.

Stephanie wants to decorate half of the 24 cupcakes with 1 candle each, which is 24 / 2 = 12 cupcakes. This accounts for 12 candles. The other half of the cupcakes, also 12 cupcakes, will be decorated with 2 candles each. This accounts for 12 * 2 = 24 candles. Now add the candles from both groups: 12 + 24 = 36 candles needed. Stephanie currently has 30 candles, so the number of additional candles needed is 36 - 30 = 6 candles.

To determine how many additional candles Stephanie needs, let's break down the problem:

1. Stephanie has 24 cupcakes to decorate.
2. She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes, which would be 12 cupcakes, with 1 candle each.
3. The other half, which would also be 12 cupcakes, will be decorated with 2 candles each.

First, calculate the total number of candles needed for the 12 cupcakes that will be decorated with 1 candle each:
\[ 12 \text{ cupcakes} \times 1 \text{ candle per cupcake} = 12 \text{ candles} \]

Next, calculate the total number of candles needed for the 12 cupcakes that will be decorated with 2 candles each:
\[ 12 \text{ cupcakes} \times 2 \text{ candles per cupcake} = 24 \text{ candles} \]

Now, add these two quantities together to find the total number of candles needed for all cupcakes:
\[ 12 \text{ candles} + 24 \text{ candles} = 36 \text{ candles} \]

Stephanie currently has 30 candles, so we subtract the number of candles she already has from the total number of candles required to find out how many more candles she needs:
\[ 36 \text{ candles needed} - 30 \text{ candles available} = 6 \text{ candles} \]

Therefore, Stephanie needs 6 additional candles to complete decorating the cupcakes.

To determine how many additional candles Stephanie needs, we need to calculate how many candles are required for each half of the cupcakes and then compare it with the number of candles she already has.

First, Stephanie wants to decorate half of the 24 cupcakes with 1 candle each. Half of 24 is 12, so she plans to use 12 candles for these cupcakes at 1 candle per cupcake:

\[ 12 \text{ cupcakes} \times 1 \text{ candle per cupcake} = 12 \text{ candles} \]

Next, Stephanie plans to decorate the other half of the 24 cupcakes with 2 candles each. The other half is also 12 cupcakes, and she plans to use 2 candles per cupcake:

\[ 12 \text{ cupcakes} \times 2 \text{ candles per cupcake} = 24 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we add the candles needed for both halves:

\[ 12 \text{ candles} + 24 \text{ candles} = 36 \text{ candles} \]

Stephanie currently has 30 candles. To find out how many additional candles she needs, we subtract the number of candles she has from the total number of candles required:

\[ 36 \text{ candles needed} - 30 \text{ candles she has} = 6 \text{ additional candles} \]

Therefore, Stephanie needs 6 additional candles to complete the cupcakes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of candles needed for half the cupcakes with 1 candle each.
Since Stephanie has 24 cupcakes, half of them is 24 / 2 = 12 cupcakes. Each of these 12 cupcakes will require 1 candle. So, she needs 12 * 1 = 12 more candles for these cupcakes.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of candles needed for the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each.
The other half of the cupcakes is also 12 cupcakes. Each of these cupcakes will require 2 candles. So, she needs 12 * 2 = 24 more candles for these cupcakes.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of additional candles needed.
Adding the two totals together, Stephanie needs 12 (for the first half) + 24 (for the second half) = 36 candles in total.

Step 4: Subtract the number of candles Stephanie already has from the total number of candles needed.
She already has 30 candles, so she needs 36 - 30 = 6 more candles to complete her cupcakes.

Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes. She wants to decorate half of them with 1 candle each, so that's \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) cupcakes with 1 candle each.
She also wants to decorate the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each, so that's another 12 cupcakes with 2 candles each.
To calculate the total number of candles needed, we multiply the number of cupcakes by the number of candles per cupcake:
- For the 12 cupcakes with 1 candle each: \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) candles.
- For the 12 cupcakes with 2 candles each: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) candles.
Adding these together, the total number of candles needed is: \( 12 + 24 = 36 \) candles.
Stephanie currently has 30 candles, so to find out how many additional candles she needs, we subtract the number of candles she has from the total number of candles needed:
\( 36 - 30 = 6 \) candles.

Additional candles Stephanie needs is 6.

To find out how many additional candles Stephanie needs, we'll start by calculating the total number of candles required for the cupcakes based on her plan.

She wants to decorate half of the 24 cupcakes with 1 candle each:
\[ 24 \times \frac{1}{2} = 12 \text{ cupcakes} \]
For these 12 cupcakes, she needs 1 candle each:
\[ 12 \times 1 = 12 \text{ candles} \]

She also wants to decorate the other half of the 24 cupcakes with 2 candles each:
\[ 24 \times \frac{1}{2} = 12 \text{ cupcakes} \]
For these 12 cupcakes, she needs 2 candles each:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ candles} \]

Adding these together gives:
\[ 12 \text{ (candles for 12 cupcakes)} + 24 \text{ (candles for 12 cupcakes)} = 36 \text{ candles} \]

Stephanie currently has 30 candles, so the number of additional candles she needs is:
\[ 36 \text{ candles needed} - 30 \text{ candles available} = 6 \text{ additional candles} \]

Therefore, Stephanie needs 6 additional candles to complete the cupcakes.

Step 1: Determine the total number of cupcakes that are to be decorated with 1 candle each.
Since Stephanie wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each, we divide the total number of cupcakes by 2.
\[
\text{Cupcakes with 1 candle each} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]

Step 2: Determine the total number of cupcakes that are to be decorated with 2 candles each.
Again, Stephanie wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each. This means she will decorate another 12 cupcakes with 2 candles each.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of candles needed.
- For the cupcakes with 1 candle each: \(12 \times 1 = 12\) candles.
- For the cupcakes with 2 candles each: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) candles.

So, the total number of candles needed is:
\[
12 + 24 = 36
\]

Step 4: Determine the number of additional candles Stephanie needs.
- She currently has 30 candles.
- She needs 36 candles in total.

Now, calculate the number of additional candles:
\[
36 - 30 = 6
\]

Step 5: Validate the number of additional candles.
- She plans to use 12 cupcakes with 1 candle each and 12 cupcakes with 2 candles each.
- Total candles: \(12 \times 1 + 12 \times 2 = 12 + 24 = 36\).

Thus, Stephanie needs 6 additional candles.
