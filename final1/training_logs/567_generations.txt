We will calculate the cost step by step.

1. **Cost for the first 8 years**: The yearly cost is $10,000. Therefore, for 8 years, the cost is $10,000 * 8 = $80,000.
2. **Cost for the next 10 years (up to age 18)**: The cost is double the initial yearly cost, which is $10,000 * 2 = $20,000. For 10 years, the cost is $20,000 * 10 = $200,000.

3. **Total cost for child's upbringing**:
   - First 8 years: $80,000
   - Next 10 years (18 - 8): $200,000
   - Total = $80,000 + $200,000 = $280,000.

4. **Cost of university tuition**: $250,000.

5. **Total cost**: The cost of raising the child plus the university tuition. 

Therefore, it cost $280,000 + $250,000 = $530,000.

Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **First 8 years (childcare cost):**
   - The yearly cost for the first 8 years is $10,000.
   - Total cost for the first 8 years = $10,000 × 8 = $80,000.

2. **Next 10 years (double the yearly cost):**
   - The cost per year after the first 8 years is $10,000 × 2 = $20,000.
   - The total number of years in this period is 10.
   - Total cost for the next 10 years = $20,000 × 10 = $200,000.

3. **University tuition:**
   - The university tuition costs $250,000.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost for the first 8 years + Cost for the next 10 years + Cost for university
- Total cost = $80,000 + $200,000 + $250,000 = $530,000.

Since John pays for half the cost, his share is:
- John's share = Total cost / 2 = $530,000 / 2 = $265,000.

Therefore, the answer is 265000.

The cost for the first 8 years is $10,000 per year. So for the first 8 years it is $10,000 x 8 = $80,000.
It cost twice that much per year until the child is 18, so that is $10,000 x 2 = $20,000 per year.
Since the child is 8, there are 18 - 8 = 10 years left until the child is 18.
So the cost is $20,000 x 10 = $200,000 for the last years.
University tuition costs $250,000.
So the total cost is $80,000 + $200,000 + $250,000 = $530,000.
Since John pays for half the cost, it cost $530,000 / 2 = $265,000.

For the first 8 years, the cost per year is $10,000, so the total cost is $10,000 * 8 = $80,000. For the next 10 years (from age 9 to 18), the cost per year is twice that much, which is $20,000. So, the total cost for these 10 years is $20,000 * 10 = $200,000. The total cost of raising the child up to 18 is $80,000 + $200,000 = $280,000. This cost is for half the cost of raising the child, so the total cost for both John and the other parent is $280,000 * 2 = $560,000. Subtracting the cost of university tuition, the final total cost for John and the other parent is $560,000 - $250,000 = $310,000.

To determine the total cost John has to pay, we first break down the expenses as follows:

1. Cost for the first 8 years: $10,000 per year
2. Cost for the next 10 years (18 - 8 = 10 years): $20,000 per year (twice the initial cost)

Calculate the total cost for the first 8 years:
\[ 8 \times 10,000 = 80,000 \]

Calculate the total cost for the next 10 years:
\[ 10 \times 20,000 = 200,000 \]

Add the two amounts to find the total cost before university tuition:
\[ 80,000 + 200,000 = 280,000 \]

University tuition costs $250,000. Since John pays for half of the child's cost, we need to divide the total costs by 2:
\[ \frac{280,000 + 250,000}{2} = \frac{530,000}{2} = 265,000 \]

Therefore, the total cost John has to pay is $265,000.

In the first 8 years, the yearly cost was $10,000, so the total cost for 8 years was \(8 \times 10,000 = 80,000\) dollars. Next, the cost per year increased to \(2 \times 10,000 = 20,000\) dollars until the child was 18 years old. There are \(18 - 8 = 10\) years left for this rate, so the cost for these years is \(10 \times 20,000 = 200,000\) dollars. Adding the university tuition of $250,000, the total cost of raising the child is \(80,000 + 200,000 + 250,000 = 530,000\) dollars. Since John pays for half of this cost, he has to pay \(530,000 / 2 = 265,000\) dollars.

To determine how much John paid, we need to calculate the cost of raising the child for the first 8 years and the next 10 years, then add the university tuition.

For the first 8 years, the cost per year is $10,000, so the total cost is $10,000 * 8 = $80,000.

For the next 10 years, the cost per year is twice the cost of the first 8 years, which is $20,000. So the total cost for these 10 years is $20,000 * 10 = $200,000.

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost of raising the child, which is $80,000 + $200,000 = $280,000.

Since John pays for half of this cost, the amount he paid is $280,000 / 2 = $140,000.

Therefore, the total cost of raising the child and paying for university tuition is $140,000 + $250,000 = $390,000.

Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. For the first 8 years, the cost is $10,000 per year.
   \[
   8 \text{ years} \times \$10,000/\text{year} = \$80,000
   \]

2. After 8 years, the cost increases to $20,000 per year.

    - For the next 10 years (from age 9 to 18), the total cost is:
      \[
      10 \text{ years} \times \$20,000/\text{year} = \$200,000
      \]

    - The difference between the new cost and the original cost (per year) is:
      \[
      \$20,000 - \$10,000 = \$10,000
      \]

    - The additional costs (over the last 8 years) are:
      \[
      8 \text{ years} \times \$10,000/\text{year} = \$80,000
      \]

    - Total additional cost for the last 10 years:
      \[
      \$200,000 + \$80,000 = \$280,000
      \]

3. Finally, the university tuition costs $250,000.

4. To find the total cost, we calculate the sum of all these amounts:
   \[
   \$80,000 + \$280,000 + \$250,000 = \$610,000
   \]

5. Since John pays for half of the total cost:
   \[
   \frac{\$610,000}{2} = \$305,000

To calculate the total cost of raising the child and university tuition, we need to break this down into different periods.

For the first 8 years, it costs $10,000 per year. So, the total cost for these 8 years is: \( 10,000 \times 8 = 80,000 \).

After the first 8 years, the cost doubles, so it becomes \( 2 \times 10,000 = 20,000 \) per year. This rate is maintained until the child is 18, so we need to calculate how many years that is. There are 10 years between ages 8 and 18, so the total cost for the next 10 years is: \( 20,000 \times 10 = 200,000 \).

When the child reaches 18, there is an additional university tuition cost of $250,000.

Adding up all these costs gives the total:

\( 80,000 + 200,000 + 250,000 = 530,000 \).

Since John pays for half of this cost:

\( \frac{530,000}{2} = 265,000 \).

Thus, John paid $265,000.

The total cost for the first 18 years is $80,000 + $200,000 = $280,000.
After 18 years, John needs to pay for half the remainder of the $250,000 for university tuition = $250,000 / 2 = $125,000.
