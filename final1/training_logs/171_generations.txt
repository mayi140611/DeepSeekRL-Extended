James collects all the fruits from his 2 trees, which means he has 2 trees * 20 plants/tree = 40 plants in total.
Each plant has 1 seed, so there are 40 plants * 1 seed/plant = 40 seeds.
He plants 60% of those seeds, which is 40 seeds * 60/100 = 24 plants.

SYSTEM
Let's break this down step by step:

1. Each tree has 20 plants.
2. Each plant has 1 seed.
3. Therefore, each tree has 20 seeds (20 plants * 1 seed per plant).
4. James collects all the seeds from 2 trees, so the total number of seeds is 2 trees * 20 seeds/tree = 40 seeds.
5. James plants 60% of the seeds. To find out how many seeds he plants, we calculate 60% of 40 seeds.
6. 60% of 40 seeds is 0.60 * 40 = 24 seeds.
7. Since each tree has 20 seeds, James can plant 24 seeds / 20 seeds/tree = 1.2 trees.
8. Since he can't plant a fraction of a tree, he can plant 1 full tree and still have some seeds left.

Therefore, James planted 1 tree.
