Village Foods sells good food at a fair price.  Their specialty is fresh vegetables.  If they get 500 customers per month, and each customer purchases 2 heads of lettuce for $1 each and 4 tomatoes for $0.5 apiece, then how much money, in dollars, will the store receive in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month?

<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the revenue from the lettuce purchases. Each customer buys 2 heads of lettuce, and each head costs $1, so the revenue from lettuce per customer is 2 * $1 = $2.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the tomato purchases. Each customer buys 4 tomatoes, and each tomato costs $0.5, so the revenue from tomatoes per customer is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total revenue per customer is the sum of the revenue from lettuce and tomatoes, which is $2 + $2 = $4.

Since there are 500 customers per month, the total revenue from both lettuce and tomatoes is $4 * 500 = $2000.

Thus, Village Foods receives $2000 in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month.

First, let's calculate the monthly sales of lettuce:
Each customer purchases 2 heads of lettuce, and each head costs $1.
So, each customer purchases 2 * $1 = $2 worth of lettuce.

Since Village Foods gets 500 customers per month, the total sales of lettuce per month is:
500 customers * $2/customer = $1000.

Next, let's calculate the monthly sales of tomatoes:
Each customer purchases 4 tomatoes, and each tomato costs $0.5.
So, each customer purchases 4 * $0.5 = $2 worth of tomatoes.

Since Village Foods gets 500 customers per month, the total sales of tomatoes per month is:
500 customers * $2/customer = $1000.

Now, to get the total sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month, we add the sales of lettuce and tomatoes:
Total sales = sales of lettuce + sales of tomatoes
Total sales = $1000 + $1000 = $2000.

Therefore, Village Foods will receive $2000 in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month.

To calculate the total sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the revenue from lettuce purchases:
   - Each customer buys 2 heads of lettuce.
   - Each head of lettuce costs $1.
   - Therefore, each customer contributes \(2 \times \$1 = \$2\) to the lettuce sales.
   - Given that there are 500 customers, the total lettuce sales per month would be \(500 \times \$2 = \$1000\).

2. Calculate the revenue from tomato purchases:
   - Each customer buys 4 tomatoes.
   - Each tomato costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, each customer contributes \(4 \times \$0.5 = \$2\) to the tomato sales.
   - Given that there are 500 customers, the total tomato sales per month would be \(500 \times \$2 = \$1000\).

3. Add the sales from lettuce and tomatoes:
   - Total revenue from lettuce sales = $1000
   - Total revenue from tomato sales = $1000
   - Total revenue from both lettuce and tomatoes = $1000 + $1000 = $2000

The total amount of money the store will receive in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month is $2000.

To calculate the total sales, we need to multiply the number of customers by the purchase price for each item (lettuce and tomatoes) and then sum the two amounts.

Let's start by calculating the total purchase for each item:

- Each customer buys 2 heads of lettuce for $1 each, so for each customer, the total for lettuce is:
  \( 2 \text{ heads} \times $1 \text{ per head} = $2 \)

- Each customer also buys 4 tomatoes for $0.5 apiece, so for each customer, the total for tomatoes is:
  \( 4 \text{ tomatoes} \times $0.5 \text{ per tomato} = $2 \)

Next, we calculate the total sales for both items in a month for all 500 customers:
- Total money from lettuce sales:
  \( 500 \text{ customers} \times $2 \text{ per customer} = $1000 \)

- Total money from tomato sales:
  \( 500 \text{ customers} \times $2 \text{ per customer} = $1000 \)

Finally, we sum the total sales for both items:
- Total sales in a month:
  \( $1000 + $1000 = $2000 \)

Therefore, Village Foods will receive $2000 in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month.

First, let's determine the total revenue from lettuce sales per customer. Each customer purchases 2 heads of lettuce at $1 each, so the revenue from lettuce per customer is 2 * $1 = $2.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from tomato sales per customer. Each customer purchases 4 tomatoes at $0.5 apiece, so the revenue from tomatoes per customer is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, we add up the revenue from lettuce and tomatoes to find the total monthly sales revenue. Therefore, the total sales revenue per month is 2 + 2 = $4 per customer.

Since there are 500 customers per month, the total sales revenue is 500 * $4 = $2,000 per month.

To calculate the total monthly sales revenue from lettuce and tomatoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the revenue from lettuce:
   - Each customer buys 2 heads of lettuce
   - Each head of lettuce costs $1
   - Therefore, for each customer, revenue from lettuce = 2 heads * $1/each = $2
   - With 500 customers per month, revenue from all customers = 500 customers * $2/customer = $1000

2. Calculate the revenue from tomatoes:
   - Each customer buys 4 tomatoes
   - Each tomato costs $0.5
   - Therefore, for each customer, revenue from tomatoes = 4 tomatoes * $0.5/each = $2
   - With 500 customers per month, revenue from all customers = 500 customers * $2/customer = $1000

3. Add the two amounts to get the total monthly sales:

To calculate the total monthly sales from the customers purchasing lettuce and tomatoes, we need to consider the following:

1. The price of one head of lettuce: $1
2. The price of one tomato: $0.50
3. The number of heads of lettuce each customer buys: 2
4. The number of tomatoes each customer buys: 4

First, we calculate the monthly sales from heads of lettuce:
4 customers * $1 per head * 2 heads per customer = $8 per customer
8 customers * $1 per customer = $8 for all heads of lettuce

Next, we calculate the monthly sales from tomatoes:
4 customers * $0.50 per tomato * 4 tomatoes per customer = $8 per customer
8 customers * $0.50 per customer = $4 for all tomatoes

Finally, we add the sales from lettuce and tomatoes:
$8 (lettuce) + $4 (tomatoes) = $12

Therefore, the store receives $12 in sales per month.

To find the total sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month, we need to break this down into two parts:

1. Calculate the total sales from the lettuce:
- Number of customers per month: 500
- Number of heads of lettuce per customer: 2
- Price of each head of lettuce: $1

First, calculate the total number of heads of lettuce sold:
\[ 500 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ heads/customer} = 1000 \text{ heads} \]

Next, calculate the total sales from the lettuce:
\[ 1000 \text{ heads} \times \$1/\text{head} = \$1000 \]

2. Calculate the total sales from the tomatoes:
- Number of customers per month: 500
- Number of tomatoes per customer: 4
- Price of each tomato: $0.5

First, calculate the total number of tomatoes sold:
\[ 500 \text{ customers} \times 4 \text{ tomatoes/customer} = 2000 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, calculate the total sales from the tomatoes:
\[ 2000 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$1000 \]

Now, add the total sales from lettuce and tomato to get the total monthly sales:
\[ \$1000 \text{ (lettuce)} + \$1000 \text{ (tomatoes)} = \$2000 \]

So, the total monthly sales of lettuce and tomatoes at Village Foods is \$2000.

To determine the monthly sales of lettuce and tomatoes from Village Foods, we first need to calculate the revenue from each item separately and then sum them up. 

1. **Lettuce Revenue:**
   - Each customer buys 2 heads of lettuce.
   - Each head of lettuce costs $1.
   - Therefore, each customer buys \(2 \times \$1 = \$2\) worth of lettuce.
   - With 500 customers per month, the total revenue from lettuce is \(500 \times \$2 = \$1000\).

2. **Tomato Revenue:**
   - Each customer buys 4 tomatoes.
   - Each tomato costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, each customer buys \(4 \times \$0.5 = \$2\) worth of tomatoes.
   - With 500 customers per month, the total revenue from tomatoes is \(500 \times \$2 = \$1000\).

3. **Total Sales:**
   - Adding the revenue from lettuce and tomatoes gives us the total monthly sales: 
     \[
     \$1000 \text{ (lettuce)} + \$1000 \text{ (tomatoes)} = \$2000

To determine the monthly sales from both lettuce and tomatoes, we need to calculate the total sales for each component separately and then add them together.

1. **Lettuce Sales Calculation:**
   - Each customer buys 2 heads of lettuce.
   - Each head of lettuce costs $1.
   - Total heads of lettuce sold per customer = 2 heads.
   - Therefore, total lettuce sold per customer = 2 heads * $1/head = $2.

   Since there are 500 customers per month:
   - Total lettuce sales per month = 500 customers * $2/customer = $1000.

2. **Tomato Sales Calculation:**
   - Each customer buys 4 tomatoes.
   - Each tomato costs $0.5.
   - Total tomatoes sold per customer = 4 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, total tomatoes sold per customer = 4 tomatoes * $0.5/tomato = $2.

   Since there are 500 customers per month:
   - Total tomato sales per month = 500 customers * $2/customer = $1000.

3. **Total Sales Calculation:**
   - Total lettuce sales per month = $1000.
   - Total tomato sales per month = $1000.
   - Total sales from both lettuce and tomatoes per month = $1000 + $1000 = $2000.

   Therefore, the store will receive $2000 in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month.
