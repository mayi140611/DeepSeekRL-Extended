system
Each of Pam's bags contains as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, and since Gerald's bag contains 40 apples, Pam's bag contains \(3 \times 40 = 120\) apples.

If Pam has 1200 apples in total, and each of her bags contains 120 apples, then the number of bags she has is \(1200 \div 120 = 10\).

Each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, which means each of Pam's bags has \(3 \times 40 = 120\) apples.

If Pam has 1200 apples in total, the number of bags she has is \(\frac{1200}{120} = 10\).

First, we need to determine the number of apples in each of Pam's bags. Since each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags and each of Gerald's bags has 40 apples, we calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples in each of Pam's bags} = 3 \times 40 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bags of apples Pam has. We know that Pam has a total of 1200 apples. To find the number of bags, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{1200}{120} = 10
\]

So, Pam has 10 bags of apples.

To find out how many bags of apples Pam has, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many apples are in one of Gerald's bags. According to the information given, Gerald's bags have 40 apples each.

2. Since each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, we can calculate the number of apples in one of Pam's bags by multiplying the number of apples in one of Gerald's bags by 3.

   \( \text{Apples in one of Pam's bags} = 40 \times 3 = 120 \)

3. Now, we know Pam has 1200 apples in total. To find out how many bags of apples she has, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one of Pam's bags.

   \( \text{Number of bags of apples Pam has} = \frac{1200}{120} \)

4. Calculating the above expression gives us:

   \( \frac{1200}{120} = 10 \)

So, Pam has 10 bags of apples.

To find out how many bags of apples Pam has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many apples are in each of Pam's bags.
2. Calculate how many bags Pam has based on the total number of apples she has.

Step 1: Each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags.
Gerald's bags have 40 apples each. Therefore, each of Pam's bags has \(3 \times 40 = 120\) apples.

Step 2: Pam has a total of 1200 apples.
To find out how many bags Pam has, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each of Pam's bags:
\[
\text{Number of bags Pam has} = \frac{1200}{120} = 10
\]

So, Pam has 10 bags of apples in total.
