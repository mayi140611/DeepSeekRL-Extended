###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

system
Let the current cost of the lawnmower be \( X \).

From the information given, a year ago, the cost was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the current cost. Therefore, a year ago, the lawnmower cost \( \frac{3}{5}X \), which is given as $1800.

So, we have the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{5}X = 1800 \]

To find \( X \), we solve for \( X \):
\[ X = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3} = 3000 \]

So, the current cost of the lawnmower is $3000.

To find out how much Mr. Lucian would pay for 4 lawnmowers at the current cost, we multiply by 4:
\[ 4 \times 3000 = 12000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Lucian would need $12000 to buy 4 lawnmowers.

Let's calculate the current cost of one lawnmower:

Let \( x \) be the current cost of one lawnmower.

According to the given information, a year ago, the cost was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the current cost. This can be written as:

\[ 1800 = \frac{3}{5}x \]

Now we solve for \( x \) to find the current cost of one lawnmower:

\[
\begin{align*}
1800 &= \frac{3}{5}x \\
1800 \times \frac{5}{3} &= x \\
3000 &= x
\end{align*}
\]

So, the current cost of one lawnmower is $3000.

Now, to find the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 such lawnmowers, we multiply the current cost by 4:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total cost} &= 4 \times 3000 \\
&= 12000
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers is $12000.

Let's denote the current cost of buying a lawnmower as \( C \).

Given that a year ago, the cost was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the current cost, we can express this as:
\[ 1800 = C - \frac{2}{5}C \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ 1800 = C - \frac{2}{5}C \]
\[ 1800 = \frac{3}{5}C \]
\[ C = \frac{5}{3} \times 1800 \]
\[ C = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers, we simply multiply the cost of one lawnmower by 4:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the current cost of a lawnmower as \( C \).

According to the problem, a year ago, the cost of a lawnmower was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than its current cost. This means the cost a year ago was \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the current cost. Therefore, if \( C \) is the current cost, then a year ago the cost was \( \frac{3}{5}C = 1800 \).

To find the current cost \( C \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{5}C = 1800 \]
\[ C = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3} = 3000 \]

So, the current cost of a lawnmower is $3000.

To find the cost of 4 lawnmowers at the current price, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 3000 = 12000 \]

Therefore, the cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 such lawnmowers is $12000.

Let's denote the current cost of buying a lawnmower as \( C \).

According to the problem, a year ago the cost was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the cost it goes for now. This means that the cost a year ago was \( \frac{3}{5} \) times the current cost. Since the cost a year ago was $1800, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{3}{5}C = 1800 \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( C \):

\[ C = \frac{1800 \times 5}{3} \]
\[ C = 600 \times 5 \]
\[ C = 3000 \]

So, the current cost of buying a lawnmower is $3000.

To find out how much it would cost Mr. Lucian to buy 4 such lawnmowers, we multiply the current cost by 4:

\[ 3000 \times 4 = 12000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Lucian would need $12000 to buy 4 lawnmowers.

To find out how much a year ago it cost to buy one lawnmower, we calculate:

$1800 * (5/3) = $3000

Now it costs $3000 a year ago, so the current price is:

$3000 * (5/3) = $5000

Hence, the cost to buy 4 lawnmowers is:

$5000 * 4 = $20,000

Let's denote the current price of one lawnmower as \( P \).

According to the information provided:
- A year ago, the total cost of buying a lawnmower was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the current price. This can be represented as \( P - \frac{2}{5}P \).
- A year ago, the total cost of buying a lawnmower was $1800. Therefore, \( P - \frac{2}{5}P = 1800 \).

Let's simplify and solve for \( P \):
\[ P - \frac{2}{5}P = 1800 \]
\[ \frac{3}{5}P = 1800 \]
\[ P = \frac{1800 \times 5}{3} \]
\[ P = 600 \times 5 \]
\[ P = 3000 \]

The current price of one lawnmower is $3000.

To calculate the cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 such lawnmowers:

To find \( C \), we solve for \( C \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{3} \):

\[ C = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3} = 3000 \]

So, the current cost of a lawnmower is $3000.

Next, we need to find the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers. This is calculated as:

Let's denote the current cost of the lawnmower as \(C\).

According to the problem, a year ago, the cost of buying the lawnmower was \(\frac{2}{5}\) times less than the current cost. This means the cost a year ago was \(90\%\) of the current cost. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \text{Costa year ago} = C - 0.2C = 0.8C \]

Given that the cost a year ago was $1800, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.8C = 1800 \]

Solving for \(C\):

\[ C = \frac{1800}{0.8} \]

Once we have the current cost \(C\), we can calculate the cost of buying 4 such lawnmowers:

\[ \text{Cost of 4 lawnmowers} = 4 \times C \]

Let's perform the calculations.

<answer>
\[ C = \frac{1800}{0.8} = 2250 \]

To find the current cost of a lawnmower, let's denote the current cost by \( C \). According to the problem, a year ago, the cost was \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1800 = 720 \) dollars. This means that the difference between the current cost and the cost a year ago is \( C - 720 \).

Given that the cost a year ago was $1800, we can calculate \( C \) as follows:
\[ C - 720 = 1800 \]
\[ C = 1800 + 720 \]
\[ C = 2520 \]

So, the current cost of a lawnmower is $2520.

To find the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers, we multiply the current cost by 4:

To determine the current cost of a lawnmower and the total cost for 4 lawnmowers, we start by using the given information.

A year ago, the cost of a lawnmower was $1800, which was 2/5 times less than the current price.

Let's denote the current price by \(x\). According to the problem, the cost 2/5 less than the current price is $1800. This relationship can be expressed as:
\[ x - \frac{2}{5}x = 1800 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{5}{5}x - \frac{2}{5}x = 1800 \]
\[ \frac{3}{5}x = 1800 \]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[ x = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3} \]
\[ x = 3000 \]

So, the current price of the lawnmower is $3000.

Mr. Lucian can now buy 4 lawnmowers at the current price. Therefore, the total cost for 4 lawnmowers is:
\[ 4 \times 3000 = 12000 \]
