###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

For every 1 minute that Carlotta sings on stage during the final opera performance, she spends an additional 3 minutes practicing and 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums. If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance?

system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Carlotta spends practicing and throwing tantrums, as well as the time she spends singing, for her 6-minute long final opera performance.

First, calculate the total time spent on practicing and throwing tantrums:
- Carlotta spends 3 minutes practicing for every 1 minute she sings.
- For 6 minutes of singing, she spends \(6 \times 3 = 18\) minutes practicing.
- Carlotta spends 5 minutes throwing tantrums for every 1 minute she sings.
- For 6 minutes of singing, she spends \(6 \times 5 = 30\) minutes throwing tantrums.

Next, add the time spent singing to the total of the time spent practicing and throwing tantrums:
- Total time spent = Time singing + Time practicing + Time throwing tantrums
- Total time spent = 6 minutes + 18 minutes + 30 minutes = 54 minutes

Therefore, the total combined amount of time that Carlotta spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance is \(54\) minutes.

First, we calculate the time Carlotta spends practicing. Since she spends 3 minutes practicing for every 1 minute of singing on stage, for a 6-minute performance, she spends \(6 \times 3 = 18\) minutes practicing.

Next, we calculate the time she spends throwing tantrums. For the same 6-minute performance, she spends \(6 \times 5 = 30\) minutes throwing tantrums.

Finally, we add the time she spends singing, practicing, and throwing tantrums together:
\[6 + 18 + 30 = 54\]

Therefore, the total combined amount of time she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance is 54 minutes.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. For every 1 minute she sings, she spends 1 * 3 = 3 minutes practicing and 1 * 5 = 5 minutes throwing tantrums.
2. For a 6-minute stage performance, the time spent on each activity repeats. So, we multiply each activity time by 6.

Total time spent practicing:
\( 6 \text{ minutes} * 3 \text{ minutes/minute} = 18 \text{ minutes} \)

Total time spent throwing tantrums:
\( 6 \text{ minutes} * 5 \text{ minutes/minute} = 30 \text{ minutes} \)

Total time spent singing:
\( 6 \text{ minutes} * 1 \text{ minute} = 6 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we add up all the times:

Total time spent practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing:
\( 18 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \)

First, calculate the total time spent practicing and throwing tantrums for the entire performance:
- Time spent practicing: \(6 \text{ minutes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/minute} = 18 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time spent throwing tantrums: \(6 \text{ minutes} \times 5 \text{ minutes/minute} = 30 \text{ minutes}\)

Now add the time Carlotta spends singing:
- Time spent singing: \(6 \text{ minutes}\)

Finally, add all these times together:
- Total time: \(18 + 30 + 6 = 54 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the answer is 54 min.

First, calculate the additional time spent practicing and throwing tantrums for 1 minute of singing. Then, for 6 minutes of singing, calculate the total additional time for practicing and throwing tantrums, and finally add the time spent singing to get the total combined amount of time.

Total additional time for 1 minute of singing = 3 minutes (practicing) + 5 minutes (throwing tantrums) = 8 minutes.

For 6 minutes of singing:
Total additional time for 6 minutes of singing = 6 minutes * 8 minutes = 48 minutes.

Total combined amount of time = time spent singing + total additional time.
Total combined amount of time = 6 minutes + 48 minutes = 54 minutes.

Let's denote the time Carlotta spends singing on stage as \( T_s \). According to the given information, for every minute she sings on stage, she spends an additional 3 minutes practicing and 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums. Therefore, the total time for singing, practicing, and throwing tantrums for one minute of stage performance is \( T_s + 3 + 5 \).

The total time for the 6-minute final stage performance is \( 6 \times (T_s + 3 + 5) \).

Since the time spent singing \( T_s \) is not given, we can't calculate the exact total time. However, we can still express the total time in terms of \( T_s \).

So the total combined amount of time spent practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance is \( 6(T_s + 8) \).

First, calculate the time Carlotta spends practicing during her stage performance. She spends 6 minutes on stage, and for every minute she sings, she spends 3 minutes practicing:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes on stage} \times 3 \text{ minutes practicing per minute on stage} = 18 \text{ minutes practicing} \]

Next, calculate the time she spends throwing temper tantrums during her stage performance. She spends 6 minutes on stage, and for every minute she sings, she spends 5 minutes throwing tantrums:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes on stage} \times 5 \text{ minutes tantrums per minute on stage} = 30 \text{ minutes tantrums} \]

Now, add up the total time spent practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing. Initially, she sings for 6 minutes:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes singing} \]

Adding the time she spends practicing:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes singing} + 18 \text{ minutes practicing} = 24 \text{ minutes total singing} \]

Adding the time she spends throwing tantrums:
\[ 24 \text{ minutes total singing} + 30 \text{ minutes tantrums} = 54 \text{ minutes total} \]

So, the total combined amount of time that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance is 54 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the time Carlotta spends singing**: 
    - Carlotta's final stage performance is 6 minutes long.

2. **Calculate the additional time spent on singing**:
    - For every 1 minute of singing, she spends 3 minutes practicing and 5 minutes throwing tantrums.
    - Therefore, for 6 minutes of singing:
    \[
    \text{Total time for singing} = 6 \, \text{minutes}
    \]
    \[
    \text{Practice time} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \, \text{minutes}
    \]
    \[
    \text{Tantrum time} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \, \text{minutes}
    \]
    \[
    \text{Total time for singing} = 18 \, \text{minutes} + 30 \, \text{minutes} = 48 \, \text{minutes}
    \]

3. **Sum up all the times**:
    - Total time spent singing: 48 minutes
    - Sum of practice time and tantrum time: 18 minutes + 30 minutes = 48 minutes
    - Total combined amount of time:
    \[
    \text{Total time} = 48 \, \text{minutes} + 48 \, \text{minutes} = 96 \, \text{minutes}
    \]

So, the total combined amount of time that Carlotta spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance is 96 minutes.
