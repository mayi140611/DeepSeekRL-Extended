<reasoning>
To determine how much John spent on the pins, we first need to calculate the discount applied to each pin. The pins are normally $20 each and are on sale for 15% off. This means that each pin is discounted by 15% of $20.

First, calculate 15% of $20:
\[ 15\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.15 \times 20 = 3 \]

So, the discount per pin is $3. Now, subtract this discount from the original price of $20 to find the sale price per pin:
\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

John is buying 10 pins at the sale price of $17 each. To find the total amount spent, multiply the sale price per pin by the number of pins:
\[ 17 \times 10 = 170 \]

Therefore, John spent $170 on the pins.

To determine how much John spent on the pins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount on each pin.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. Multiply the sale price by the number of pins John purchased.

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount on each pin.
The original price of each pin is $20. The discount is 15%, so the discount amount per pin is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{15}{100} = 20 \times 0.15 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price.
The sale price of each pin is:
\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Multiply the sale price by the number of pins John purchased.
John bought 10 pins, so he spent:
\[ 17 \times 10 = 170 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John spent $170 on pins.

First, we need to calculate the discount on each pin. Since the pins are on sale for 15% off, we can find the discount amount by calculating 15% of the original price of $20.

\[ \text{Discount} = 20 \times \frac{15}{100} = 20 \times 0.15 = 3 \]

So, each pin is now $20 - $3 = $17.

Next, we multiply the new price of each pin by the number of pins John bought, which is 10:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \times 10 = 170 \]

Therefore, John spent $170 on pins.

To calculate the cost, we need to first find the discount amount. The discount on each pin is 15% of $20, which is calculated as 15/100 * $20 = $3. 

So, each pin costs $20 - $3 = $17 after the discount.

Since John is buying 10 pins, the total cost will be 10 * $17 = $170.

Therefore, John spent $170 on pins.

John bought 10 pins at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is 10 * $20 = $200.
The pins were on sale for 15% off, so the discount amount is 15/100 * $200 = $30.
The total cost after the discount is $200 - $30 = $170.

Therefore, John spent $170 on pins.

To find out how much John spent on the pins, we first need to calculate the sale price of each pin. The pins are normally $20 each, and there is a 15% discount. 

First, calculate 15% of $20:
15% of $20 = 0.15 * $20 = $3

Since there is a $3 discount per pin, the sale price of each pin is:
$20 (original price) - $3 (discount) = $17

John bought 10 pins, so the total cost for 10 pins is:
$17 (sale price per pin) * 10 (number of pins) = $170

Therefore, John spent $170 on the pins.

John bought 10 pins at a normal price of $20 each. The sale price was 15% off, so each pin would be $20 - 15% of $20.

Calculate the discount:
15% of $20 is \( 0.15 \times 20 = $3 \).

Subtract the discount from the original price:
$20 - $3 = $17.

\(20 - 3 = 17\)

So each pin now costs $17 on sale.

John bought 10 pins, so we multiply the sale price by the number of pins:
