#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the height of the sunflowers from Packet B as \( x \).

According to the information given, the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B. This can be expressed as:

\[ 1.20x = 192 \]

To find the height of the sunflowers from Packet B (\( x \)), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{192}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 160 \]

So, the sunflowers from Packet B were 160 inches tall.

Let the height of the sunflowers from Packet B be \( x \) inches. Since the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than those from Packet B, we can express the height of the sunflowers from Packet A as \( 1.2x \).

We know from the problem that the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 1.2x = 192 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{192}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 160 \]

So, the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is 160 inches.

Let's denote the height of the sunflowers from Packet B as \( h \) inches.

According to the problem, the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2 \times h = 192 \]

To find \( h \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ h = \frac{192}{1.2} \]

Now, let's calculate the exact value of \( h \):
\[ h = \frac{192}{1.2} = 160 \]

So, the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is 160 inches.

Let the height of the sunflowers from Packet B be \( h \) inches. According to the problem, the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B, which means the sunflowers from Packet A are \( 1.2h \) inches tall.

Since the sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.2h = 192 \]

To find \( h \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ h = \frac{192}{1.2} \]

Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Determine the height comparison between the sunflowers from Packet A and B:**
   - The sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B.

2. **Express the height of Packet A in terms of the height of Packet B:**
   - If Packet A is 20% taller, then the height of Packet B would be 100% of the height of Packet A minus that 20%.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( H_B \) represent the height of the sunflowers from Packet B.
   - Then, the height of the sunflowers from Packet A can be expressed as:
     \[
     H_A = H_B \times (1 + 0.20)
     \]
   - Given \( H_A = 192 \) inches, we substitute and solve for \( H_B \):
     \[
     192 = H_B \times 1.20
     \]

4. **Solve for \( H_B \):**
   - To isolate \( H_B \), divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
     \[
     H_B = \frac{192}{1.20}
     \]
   - Calculate the value:
     \[
     H_B = 160
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The height of the sunflowers from Packet B is 160 inches.

Let \( h_B \) be the height of the sunflowers from Packet B in inches.

According to the problem, sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than sunflowers from Packet B. This can be expressed as:
\[
h_A = h_B + 0.20 \times h_B
\]
Substituting the known height of sunflowers from Packet A:
\[
192 = h_B + 0.20 \times h_B
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
192 = h_B \times (1 + 0.20)
\]
\[
192 = h_B \times 1.20
\]

Now, solve for \( h_B \):
\[
h_B = \frac{192}{1.20}
\]
\[
h_B = 160
\]

So, the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is \( \boxed{160} \) inches.

Let \( h_B \) be the height of the sunflowers from Packet B in inches. According to the problem, the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than those from Packet B. This can be expressed as:

\[ h_A = h_B + 0.20 h_B \]

Given that \( h_A = 192 \) inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 192 = h_B + 0.20 h_B \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 192 = 1.20 h_B \]

To find \( h_B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ h_B = \frac{192}{1.20} \]

Performing the division gives:

\[ h_B = 160 \]

So, the sunflowers from Packet B were 160 inches tall.

Let \( h_B \) represent the height of the sunflowers from Packet B in inches.

Given:
- The sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B.
- The sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall.

We can express the relationship mathematically:
\[ 192 = h_B + 0.2h_B \]

Combining like terms:
