The merchant sold half of the carrots, which amount to 15 kg * 0.5 = 7.5 kg. He also sold half of the zucchini, which amount to 13 kg * 0.5 = 6.5 kg. Broccoli is sold as a whole, so the total amount of vegetables he sold is 7.5 + 6.5 + 8 = 22 kg.

The total mass of vegetables initially installed is:
\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 13 \text{ kg} + 8 \text{ kg} = 36 \text{ kg} \]

Since he sold half of them, the mass of vegetables he sold is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ kg}}{2} = 18 \text{ kg} \]

The merchant installed a total of \(15 + 13 + 8 = 36\) kg of vegetables. He sold half of them, so he sold \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) kg of vegetables.

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####

system
To determine the mass of vegetables sold, we first need to calculate the total mass of vegetables the merchant initially installed. The total mass is the sum of the masses of the carrots, zucchini, and broccoli:

\[
15 \, \text{kg} + 13 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 36 \, \text{kg}
\]

The merchant sold only half of the total mass. Therefore, the mass of vegetables sold is half of 36 kg:

\[
\frac{36 \, \text{kg}}{2} = 18 \, \text{kg}
\]

So, the mass of vegetables sold is \boxed{18 \, \text{kg}}.

First, calculate the total mass of vegetables initially installed by the merchant:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg (carrots)} + 13 \, \text{kg (zucchini)} + 8 \, \text{kg (broccoli)} = 36 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, determine the mass of vegetables sold, which is only half of the total mass:

\[ \frac{36 \, \text{kg}}{2} = 18 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the merchant sold 18 kg of vegetables.

The merchant initially had 15 kg of carrots, 13 kg of zucchini, and 8 kg of broccoli. In total, he had:

15 kg + 13 kg + 8 kg = 36 kg of vegetables.

He sold only half of them, so:

1/2 * 36 kg = 18 kg.

Therefore, the mass of vegetables he sold is 18 kg.

To find the mass of vegetables sold, we first need to determine the total mass of vegetables installed.

Total mass of vegetables installed = Mass of carrots + Mass of zucchini + Mass of broccoli
                               = 15 kg + 13 kg + 8 kg
                               = 36 kg

The merchant sold half of the total mass of vegetables installed, so we need to find half of 36 kg.

Mass of vegetables sold = Half of total mass
                     = 36 kg / 2
                     = 18 kg

Therefore, the merchant sold 18 kg of vegetables.
