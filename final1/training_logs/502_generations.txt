###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Yasna has two books. One book is 180 pages long, and the other book is 100 pages long. If Yasna wants to finish both of the books in two weeks, how many pages will Yasna need to read every day, if she reads an equal number of pages each day?

system
To find out how many pages Yasna needs to read every day, we first need to find the total number of pages in both books. This is done by adding the number of pages in the first book to the number of pages in the second book: 

\[ 180 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 280 \text{ pages} \]

Since Yasna wants to finish both books in two weeks, we need to convert this to a daily reading plan. There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks have:

\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many pages she needs to read each day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

\[ \frac{280 \text{ pages}}{14 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ pages/day} \]

So, Yasna needs to read 20 pages every day to finish both books in two weeks.

To determine how many pages Yasna needs to read every day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages in both books combined. The first book is 180 pages long, and the second book is 100 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages is:

\[ 180 + 100 = 280 \text{ pages} \]

Yasna wants to finish both books in two weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, two weeks consist of:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many pages Yasna needs to read every day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

\[ \frac{280 \text{ pages}}{14 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ pages/day} \]

So, Yasna needs to read 20 pages every day.

Yasna wants to finish both books in two weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are:
2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days

Now, to find out how many pages she needs to read each day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

280 pages / 14 days = 20 pages/day

First, we need to calculate the total number of pages in both books. The first book is 180 pages long, and the second book is 100 pages long. Adding these together:

\[ 180 + 100 = 280 \]

Yasna wants to finish both books in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks. To find out how many pages Yasna needs to read each day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

To find out how many pages Yasna needs to read every day, we first need to determine the total number of pages she needs to read, which is the sum of the pages from both books.

Total pages to read = Pages from the first book + Pages from the second book
Total pages to read = 180 pages + 100 pages = 280 pages

Since Yasna needs to finish both books in two weeks, we can calculate the number of pages to read each day by dividing the total pages by the number of days in two weeks.

Total days in two weeks = 14 days

Pages per day = Total pages to read / Total days
Pages per day = 280 pages / 14 days = 20 pages per day

Therefore, Yasna needs to read 20 pages every day to finish both books in two weeks.
