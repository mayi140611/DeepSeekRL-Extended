<reasoning>
To determine how many toy cars Bobby will have in three years, we need to calculate the number of cars year by year, taking into account the 50% increase each year.

1. **Initial number of cars**: Bobby starts with 16 cars.
2. **Year 1**: Bobby's collection increases by 50%. 
   \[
   \text{Cars after Year 1} = 16 + 0.5 \times 16 = 16 + 8 = 24
   \]
3. **Year 2**: Bobby's number of cars increases by 50% again.
   \[
   \text{Cars after Year 2} = 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36
   \]
4. **Year 3**: Bobby's number of cars increases by 50% once more.
   \[
   \text{Cars after Year 3} = 36 + 0.5 \times 36 = 36 + 18 = 54
   \]

So, after three years, Bobby will have 54 toy cars.

system
Bobby initially has 16 toy cars. Each year, the number of cars increases by 50%. To find out how many cars Bobby will have in three years, we need to calculate 50% of 16 and add it to the initial number of cars three times.

First, calculate the number of cars added in the first year:
\[ 16 \times \frac{50}{100} = 16 \times 0.5 = 8 \]

After the first year, Bobby will have:
\[ 16 + 8 = 24 \]

Next, calculate the number of cars added in the second year (of the second year from the initial count):
\[ 24 \times 0.5 = 12 \]

After the second year, Bobby will have:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \]

Finally, calculate the number of cars added in the third year:
\[ 36 \times 0.5 = 18 \]

After the third year, Bobby will have:
\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \]

So, in three years, Bobby will have 54 toy cars.

Initially, Bobby has 16 toy cars. Since the number of cars increases by 50% every year, we need to calculate the increase for each of the three years.

After the first year, the number of cars will be:
\[ 16 + (0.5 \times 16) = 16 + 8 = 24 \]

After the second year, the number of cars will be:
\[ 24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

After the third year, the number of cars will be:
\[ 36 + (0.5 \times 36) = 36 + 18 = 54 \]

So, in three years, Bobby will have 54 toy cars.
