#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Total cost of notepads = $10.00.
Cost per notepad = $1.25.

Number of notepads = Total cost of notepads / Cost per notepad
Number of notepads = $10.00 / $1.25
Number of notepads = 8.

Each notepad has 60 pages.

Total number of pages = Number of notepads * Pages per notepad
Total number of pages = 8 * 60

Total number of pages = 480.

To find out how many pages Bart bought, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of notepads Bart bought: Since each notepad costs $1.25 and Bart spent $10, we can divide $10 by $1.25 to find out how many notepads he bought.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of notepads} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per notepad}} = \frac{10}{1.25}
   \]

2. Perform the division:
   
   \[
   \frac{10}{1.25} = 8
   \]

   So, Bart bought 8 notepads.

3. Calculate the total number of pages: Each notepad has 60 pages, so we multiply the number of notepads by the number of pages per notepad.
   
   \[
   \text{Total number of pages} = \text{Number of notepads} \times \text{Pages per notepad} = 8 \times 60
   \]

4. Perform the multiplication:
   
   \[
   8 \times 60 = 480
   \]

So, Bart bought a total of 480 pages.

To determine the total number of pages Bart bought, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of notepads Bart bought:**
   - Bart spent a total of $10.
   - Each notepad costs $1.25.

   Given the cost per notepad, we can find out how many notepads Bart bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per notepad:
   \[
   \text{Number of notepads} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per notepad}} = \frac{10}{1.25}
   \]
   Simplifying the division:
   \[
   \frac{10}{1.25} = 8
   \]
   So, Bart bought 8 notepads.

2. **Calculate the total number of pages:**
   - Each notepad has 60 pages.
   - Bart bought 8 notepads.

   To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of notepads by the number of pages per notepad:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pages} = \text{Number of notepads} \times \text{Pages per notepad} = 8 \times 60
   \]
   Simplifying the multiplication:
   \[
   8 \times 60 = 480
   \]

So, Bart bought a total of 480 pages.
