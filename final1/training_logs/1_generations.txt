To calculate Weng's earnings from babysitting, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the babysitting time from minutes to hours: 50 minutes / 60 = 0.83 hours.
2. Multiply the time in hours by her hourly rate: 0.83 hours * $12/hour = $10.12.

Therefore, Weng earned $10.12 yesterday by babysitting.

To calculate how much Weng earned for babysitting, we first need to determine the duration of her babysitting in hours. Since she babysat for 50 minutes, we convert this time into hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

\[ \text{Duration in hours} = \frac{\text{Time in minutes}}{60} \]

\[ \text{Duration in hours} = \frac{50}{60} \]

\[ \text{Duration in hours} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.83 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the earnings by multiplying the duration of babysitting by her hourly wage:

\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Duration in hours} \times \text{Hourly Wage} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \frac{5}{6} \times 12 \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = 10 \]

Therefore, Weng earned $10 for babysitting for 50 minutes yesterday.

To find out how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes yesterday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine her hourly rate:**
   Weng earns $12 per hour.

2. **Convert babysitting time into hours:**
   Since 50 minutes is half an hour (because 50 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 50/60 = 5/6 hour), we need to find out what fraction of an hour 50 minutes represents.

3. **Calculate Weng's earnings:**
   Multiply her hourly rate by the fraction of an hour she worked:
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = 12 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times \frac{5}{6} \, \text{hour}
   \]
   Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 12 \times 0.8333 = 10
   \]

Therefore, Weng earned $10 for babysitting for 50 minutes yesterday.

To calculate the amount Weng earned from babysitting for 50 minutes, we need to first convert the time into hours to match the hourly rate.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 50 minutes is:

\[ \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Now, we multiply the number of hours by Weng's hourly rate:

\[ \frac{5}{6} \times \$12 = \$10 \]

Therefore, Weng earned $10 for the 50 minutes of babysitting she did yesterday.

To calculate Weng's earnings for 50 minutes of babysitting, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the rate**: Weng earns $12 per hour.
2. **Convert minutes to hours**: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 50 minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Hours} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the earnings**: Multiply the number of hours by her hourly rate:
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \left(\frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}\right) \times \$12/\text{hour}
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \frac{5 \times 12}{6} = \frac{60}{6} = \$10
   \]

To calculate how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours because the hourly rate is given in dollars per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 minutes is equivalent to:

\[ \frac{50}{60} \text{ hours} \]

Then, we can multiply this rate by her hourly wage of $12 to find her earnings:

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} \]

Let's calculate the earnings:

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left( \frac{50}{60} \right) \times 12 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times \frac{50}{60} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = 12 \times \frac{50}{60} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} \]

\[ \text{Earnings} = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \]

To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes yesterday, we need to calculate her hourly wage for 50 minutes and then apply that amount to the time worked.

1. **Calculate the hourly wage for 50 minutes:**
   - Weng earns $12 an hour.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - To find the hourly wage in minutes, we divide the hourly wage by the number of minutes in an hour:

   \[
   12 \text{ dollars/hour} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 0.2 \text{ dollars/minute}
   \]

2. **Calculate the earnings for 50 minutes:**
   - Now, we multiply the hourly wage in minutes by the number of minutes worked:

   \[
   0.2 \text{ dollars/minute} \times 50 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Weng earned $10 for babysitting for 50 minutes yesterday.

To calculate how much Weng earned for 50 minutes of babysitting, we need to first determine the rate per minute. Weng earns $12 per hour, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find the hourly rate per minute by dividing $12 by 60.

Hourly rate per minute: $12 / 60 minutes = $0.20 per minute.

Now, to calculate the earnings for 50 minutes, we multiply the hourly rate per minute by the number of minutes worked.

Earnings = Hourly rate per minute * Number of minutes worked

Earnings = $0.20 * 50 minutes = $10.

So, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.
