system
To find the total number of arms, we need to add the number of arms on the starfish and the seastar together.

1. Carly collected 7 starfish with 5 arms each:
   \[
   7 \text{ starfish} \times 5 \text{ arms/starfish} = 35 \text{ arms}
   \]

2. She also collected 1 seastar with 14 arms:
   \[
   14 \text{ arms}
   \]

3. Add the arms from the starfish and the seastar to find the total number of arms:
   \[
   35 \text{ arms} + 14 \text{ arms} = 49 \text{ arms}
   \]

Therefore, the animals Carly collected have a total of 49 arms.

Carly has 7 starfish with 5 arms each, which totals to \( 7 \times 5 = 35 \) arms from the starfish.

She also has one seastar with 14 arms.

In total, the animals she collected have \( 35 + 14 = 49 \) arms.

To determine the total number of arms of the animals Carly collected, we need to calculate the arms of the starfish and the seastar separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the total number of arms on the starfish. Carly collected 7 starfish, and each starfish has 5 arms. Therefore, the total number of arms on the starfish is:
\[ 7 \text{ starfish} \times 5 \text{ arms per starfish} = 35 \text{ arms} \]

Next, we consider the seastar. The seastar has 14 arms. So, the total number of arms on the seastar is:
\[ 14 \text{ arms} \]

Now, we add the total number of arms from the starfish and the seastar to find the total number of arms:
\[ 35 \text{ arms} + 14 \text{ arms} = 49 \text{ arms} \]

Thus, the total number of arms of the animals Carly collected is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]

To find the total number of arms, we need to calculate the arms of the starfish and the seastar and then add them together. Each starfish has 5 arms, and there are 7 starfish, so the total number of arms from the starfish is 5 * 7 = 35. The seastar has 14 arms. Therefore, the total number of arms from all the animals is 35 + 14 = 49.

system
To find the total number of arms, we first calculate the total number of arms on the starfish and then add the number of arms on the seastar.

For the starfish:
Each starfish has 5 arms, and there are 7 starfish.
So, the total number of arms on the starfish = 7 starfish * 5 arms/starfish = 35 arms

Now we add the number of arms on the seastar:
The seastar has 14 arms.

Therefore, the total number of arms on all animals Carly collected is:
35 arms (from starfish) + 14 arms (from seastar) = 49 arms

To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total number of arms for the starfish. Carly collected 7 starfish, and each starfish has 5 arms. 

\[ 7 \text{ starfish} \times 5 \text{ arms/starfish} = 35 \text{ arms} \]

Next, we need to add the number of arms of the seastar:

\[ 35 \text{ arms from starfish} + 14 \text{ arms of seastar} = 49 \text{ arms} \]

Therefore, the total number of arms the animals Carly collected have is 49.

To find the total number of arms of the animals Carly collected, we need to calculate the total number of arms of the starfish and then add it to the number of arms of the seastar.

First, since each starfish has 5 arms and Carly collected 7 starfish, the total number of arms of the starfish is:
\[ 7 \text{ starfish} \times 5 \text{ arms/starfish} = 35 \text{ arms} \]

Next, since the seastar has 14 arms, we add the number of arms of the seastar to the total number of arms of the starfish:
\[ 35 \text{ arms} + 14 \text{ arms} = 49 \text{ arms} \]

So, Carly has a total of 49 arms from the animals she collected.

There is 1 seastar with 14 arms, so the seastar has 14 arms.

Now, let's add the number of arms for the starfish and the seastar:
Total arms = 35 (from the starfish) + 14 (from the seastar) = 49.

Therefore, the animals Carly collected have a total of 49 arms.

We can find the total number of arms the animals Carly collected have by adding the number of starfish with their arms to the number of arms of the seastar. The starfish each have 5 arms, so the 7 starfish have \(7 \times 5 = 35\) arms. Adding the 14 arms of the seastar, we get \(35 + 14 = 49\) arms in total.

To find the total number of arms, we can calculate the total number of arms from the starfish and then add the arms from the seastar.

First, we calculate the total number of arms from the starfish. Since each starfish has 5 arms and there are 7 starfish, we multiply 5 by 7:

\[5 \times 7 = 35\]

So, the 7 starfish together have 35 arms.

Next, we add the arms from the seastar. The seastar has 14 arms:

\[35 + 14 = 49\]

Therefore, the total number of arms, including the starfish and the seastar, is 49.
