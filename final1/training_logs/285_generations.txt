To find out how many hours he has to watch daily, we first calculate the total time required to watch all episodes, then divide that by the number of days he has to finish them.

Total time required = Number of episodes × Length of each episode
Total time required = 20 × 30
Total time required = 600 minutes

Now we convert this time into hours:
600 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 10 hours

John has 5 days to watch these episodes, so we divide the total hours by the number of days:
10 hours ÷ 5 days = 2 hours/day

To find the total number of minutes John needs to watch, we multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode: 20 episodes * 30 minutes/episode = 600 minutes. To find the total number of hours John needs to watch, we divide the total number of minutes by the number of minutes in an hour: 600 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 10 hours.

To find out how many minutes John has to watch per day, we need to know the total number of minutes in the show and divide it by the number of days.

Total minutes in the show = 20 episodes * 30 minutes/episode = 600 minutes.

John wants to finish the show in 5 days, so he has to watch 600 minutes in 5 days.

Minutes to watch per day = Total minutes / Number of days = 600 minutes / 5 days = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Minutes to watch per day in hours = 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours/day.

To find out how many hours John has to watch per day, we need to first calculate the total time required to watch all the episodes. Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we can multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode.

20 episodes * 30 minutes/episode = 600 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes by 60.

600 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 10 hours

Since John wants to finish the show in 5 days, we can divide the total hours by the number of days.

10 hours / 5 days = 2 hours/day

Therefore, John has to watch 2 hours a day.

To find the total time John needs to watch, we first calculate the total time in minutes by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes.

To find out how many hours John has to watch a day, we first need to find out how many episodes he has to watch in total. Since each episode is 30 minutes long and there are 20 episodes, we can calculate the total number of minutes he needs to watch by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total minutes needed = Number of episodes × Length of each episode
Total minutes needed = 20 episodes × 30 minutes
Total minutes needed = 600 minutes

Now, we have 5 days to finish watching all 600 minutes. To find out how many minutes he needs to watch each day, we divide the total number of minutes by the number of days.

Minutes per day = Total minutes needed ÷ Number of days
Minutes per day = 600 minutes ÷ 5 days
Minutes per day = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Hours per day = Minutes per day ÷ 60
Hours per day = 120 minutes ÷ 60
Hours per day = 2 hours

So, John needs to watch 2 hours a day to finish the show in 5 days.

Each episode is 30 minutes long, so the total time for all episodes is 20 * 30 = 600 minutes.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total time in hours is 600 / 60 = 10 hours.
If he only has 5 days to finish, then he needs to watch 10 / 5 = 2 hours per day.

Let's break down the problem:

1. There are 20 episodes in total.
2. Each episode is 30 minutes long.
3. He has 5 days to finish the show.
We need to calculate the total time required to watch all episodes:
Total time = Number of episodes × Length of each episode
Total time = 20 episodes × 30 minutes/episode
Total time = 600 minutes
Now, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
Total time in hours = Total time in minutes ÷ 60
Total time in hours = 600 minutes ÷ 60
Total time in hours = 10 hours
John needs to watch for 10 hours over 5 days. To find out the average time he needs to watch each day, we divide the total time by the number of days:
Hours per day = Total hours ÷ Number of days
Hours per day = 10 hours ÷ 5 days
Hours per day = 2 hours

To find out how many hours John has to watch per day, we first need to calculate the total number of minutes he needs to watch. If there are 20 episodes, each 30 minutes long, then the total time needed is \(20 \times 30 = 600\) minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, \(600 / 60 = 10\) hours. To find out how many hours he needs to watch per day if he wants to finish in 5 days, we divide the total hours by 5. So, \(10 / 5 = 2\) hours per day.
