First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Faith bought. The flour costs $5 and the cake stand costs $28. So, the total cost is $5 + $28 = $33.

Next, Faith gave the cashier two $20 bills, which totals $40. In addition, she gave $3 in loose coins. So, the total amount Faith gave to the cashier is $40 + $3 = $43.

Now, we need to find out the change Faith will receive. To do this, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount Faith gave to the cashier. So, the change is $43 - $33 = $10.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Faith bought. The cost for flour is $5 and the cost for the cake stand is $28. Adding these together, the total cost is $5 + $28 = $33.

Next, we need to determine how much money Faith gave to the cashier. She gave two $20 bills, which amounts to $20 x 2 = $40, and $3 in loose coins. Therefore, the total amount she gave is $40 + $3 = $43.

To find out how much change Faith will receive, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount she gave to the cashier. So, the change is $43 - $33 = $10.

Finally, Faith will receive $10 in change.

To determine how much change Faith will receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items purchased:**
   - Flour: $5
   - Cake stand: $28
   - Total cost = Flour cost + Cake stand cost = $5 + $28 = $33

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Faith gave to the cashier:**
   - Two $20 bills: $20 Ã— 2 = $40
   - Loose coins: $3
   - Total amount given = $40 + $3 = $43

3. **Calculate the change Faith will receive:**
   - Change = Total amount given - Total cost = $43 - $33 = $10

Therefore, Faith will receive $10 in change.

First, we calculate the total cost of the items Faith bought:
- Flour costs $5.
- Cake stand costs $28.
- Total cost = $5 + $28 = $33.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Faith gave to the cashier:
- She gave two $20 bills, which is $20 * 2 = $40.
- She also gave $3 in loose coins.
- Total amount given = $40 + $3 = $43.

Now, we calculate the change Faith will receive:
- Change = Total amount given - Total cost = $43 - $33 = $10.

Therefore, the change Faith will receive is $10.

First, let's find out the total cost of the items Faith bought:
Cost of flour = $5
Cost of cake stand = $28
Total cost = $5 + $28 = $33

Next, let's calculate the amount Faith paid to the cashier:
* Two $20 bills = 2 $20 bills = 2 * $20 = $40
* $3 in loose coins = $3
Total payment = $40 + $3 = $43

Now, let's find out the change Faith will receive:
Change = Total payment - Total cost
Change = $43 - $33 = $10

Therefore, Faith will receive $10 in change.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Faith bought. This includes the flour, which costs $5, and the cake stand, which costs $28. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 + 28 = 33 \]

Next, we need to determine the amount Faith gave to the cashier. She gave two $20 bills, which total:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]
Additionally, she gave $3 in loose coins. So, the total amount given is:
\[ 40 + 3 = 43 \]

The change received can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total amount given. Therefore, the change is:
\[ 43 - 33 = 10 \]

Thus, the amount of change Faith will receive is $10.

Faith's total bill for the items she bought is the sum of the costs of the flour and the cake stand, which is 5 + 28 = $33. She gave the cashier two $20 bills and 3 dollars in loose coins, making the total amount she paid $20 + 20 + 3 = $43. Therefore, the change that Faith will receive is her total payment minus the total bill, which is $43 - $33 = $10.

First, let's calculate the total amount Faith spent on the items she bought. The flour costs $5 and the cake stand costs $28, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$5 + \$28 = \$33 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Faith gave to the cashier. She gave two $20 bills, which is:
\[ 2 \times \$20 = \$40 \]
Additionally, she gave $3 in loose coins, so the total amount she gave is:
\[ \$40 + \$3 = \$43 \]

Now, we can calculate the change Faith will receive by subtracting the total cost of the items from the amount she gave:
\[ \text{Change} = \$43 - \$33 = \$10 \]

Therefore, Faith will receive \$10 in change.

To determine the change Faith will receive, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase. The flour costs $5 and the cake stand costs $28. Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of her purchase.

Total cost = Cost of flour + Cost of cake stand
Total cost = $5 + $28
Total cost = $33

Next, we calculate the total amount Faith gave to the cashier. She gave two $20 bills and $3 in loose coins. Adding these together gives the total amount given to the cashier.

Total amount given = Amount from two $20 bills + Loose coins
Total amount given = ($20 + $20) + $3
Total amount given = $40 + $3
Total amount given = $43

Now, to find the change, we subtract the total cost of her purchase from the total amount given.

Change = Total amount given - Total cost
Change = $43 - $33
Change = $10

Therefore, Faith will receive $10 in change.
