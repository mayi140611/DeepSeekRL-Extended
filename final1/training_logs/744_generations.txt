To find out how much of her savings Scarlet has left, we first need to calculate the total cost of the earrings and necklace she bought. The cost of the earrings is $23, and the cost of the necklace is $48. So, the total cost is $23 + $48 = $71. Scarlet started with $80, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from her initial savings: $80 - $71 = $9.

Scarlet initially saved $80. She spent $23 on earrings and $48 on a necklace. To find out how much she has left, we need to subtract the total spent on the earrings and necklace from her initial savings.

Total spent = cost of earrings + cost of necklace
Total spent = $23 + $48
Total spent = $71

Now we subtract the total spent from her initial savings:
Remaining savings = Initial savings - Total spent
Remaining savings = $80 - $71
Remaining savings = $9

Scarlet has $9 left from her savings.

To determine how much of her savings Scarlet has left after her purchases, we first need to calculate the total amount she spent. She initially saved $80. She bought a pair of earrings for $23 and a necklace for $48. We add these amounts together to find the total spent:

$23 (earrings) + $48 (necklace) = $71 in total spent.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from her initial savings:

$80 (initial savings) - $71 (total spent) = $9.

Therefore, after buying the earrings and the necklace, Scarlet has $9 left.

3. Cost of the necklace: $48

Total spent on jewelry = Cost of earrings + Cost of necklace
Total spent on jewelry = $23 + $48 = $71

Remaining savings = Initial savings - Total spent
Remaining savings = $80 - $71 = $9

Scarlet has $9 left.

To find out how much of her savings Scarlet has left, we can start with her initial savings and subtract the cost of each item she bought. She initially saved $80, bought earring for $23, then a necklace for $48. The calculation can be done as follows:

1. Initial savings: $80
2. Cost of earrings: $23
3. Cost of necklace: $48

After buying the earrings and the necklace, Scarlet's remaining savings can be calculated as:
Remaining savings = Initial savings - Cost of earrings - Cost of necklace
Remaining savings = $80 - $23 - $48

Now let's do the subtraction:

$80 - $23 = $57
$57 - $48 = $9

So, Scarlet has $9 left in her savings.
