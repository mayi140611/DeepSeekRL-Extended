First, we need to determine the size of Joel's fruit section. Since the fruit section is half of the garden, we calculate:

\[ \text{Fruit section size} = \frac{64 \text{ square feet}}{2} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, Joel wants to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries. To find the square feet for strawberries, we calculate:

\[ \text{Square feet for strawberries} = \frac{32 \text{ square feet}}{4} = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Joel will use 8 square feet of his garden for strawberries.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the size of the fruit section of the garden. Since Joel wants to use half of the garden for fruits, we calculate half of 64 square feet. 

\[ \text{Fruit section size} = \frac{64\, \text{square feet}}{2} = 32\, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much of the fruit section will be used for strawberries. Joel plans to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries.

\[ \text{Strawberries section size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 32\, \text{square feet} = 8\, \text{square feet} \]

So, 8 square feet of the garden will be used for strawberries.

Joel's total garden size is 64 square feet. He wants to divide it into two equal parts for fruits and vegetables, so each part is:
\[ \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

He then wants to further divide the fruit section by a quarter for strawberries:
\[ \frac{32}{4} = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

So, Joel will use 8 square feet of the garden for strawberries.

To find out how much of the garden will be used for strawberries, we start by determining the amount of the garden dedicated to fruits and vegetables. Since Joel wants to use half of the garden for fruits and another half for vegetables, each section is:

\[ \text{Fruit section} = \frac{64 \text{ square feet}}{2} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, Joel wants to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries. To find this, we calculate:

\[ \text{Square feet for strawberries} = \frac{32 \text{ square feet}}{4} = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, 8 square feet of the garden will be used for strawberries.

To determine how many square feet of Joel's garden will be used for strawberries, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area allocated for fruits:**
   Joel wants to use half of his garden for fruits. Since the total garden area is 64 square feet:
   \[
   \text{Area for fruits} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the area allocated for strawberries:**
   Joel plans to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries. Therefore, we need to find one quarter of the area allocated for fruits:
   \[
   \text{Area for strawberries} = \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Now, let's verify this by working through the problem step-by-step.

3. **Verify the fruit section area:**
   \[
   \text{Area for fruits} = 64 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   Joel is using half of this section, which is correct:
   \[
   \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate the strawberries section:**
   Joel is using a quarter of the fruits section for strawberries:
   \[
   \text{Area for strawberries} = \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Therefore, the area allocated for strawberries in Joel’s garden is 8 square feet.

Joel’s total garden area is 64 square feet. Half of the garden is reserved for fruits, so the fruit section is:
\[ 64 \div 2 = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, he wants to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries. Therefore, the area used for strawberries is:
\[ 32 \div 4 = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

Now let's calculate the vegetable section by subtracting the fruit section from the total garden size:
\[ 64 - 32 \]
So the vegetable section is:
\[ 32 \text{ square feet} \]

Joel wants to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries. To find the area thus used in the fruit section:
\[ 32 \div 4 = 8 \text{ square feet} \]
The vegetable section size before calculating the area dedicated to strawberries is:
\[ 32 - 32 \div 4 \]
This is:
\[ 32 - 8 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, Joel will use 8 square feet of the garden for strawberries.

Joel's garden is 64 square feet large. He wants to use half of the garden for fruits and half for vegetables. So, he will use 64 / 2 = 32 square feet for fruits.

He also wants to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries. So, he will use 32 / 4 = 8 square feet for strawberries.

First, we need to calculate the size of each section of the garden. Since Joel wants to use half of the garden for fruits and vegetables, the 64 square feet will be split equally between the two sections:
\( \frac{64}{2} = 32 \) square feet for fruits and \( 32 \) square feet for vegetables.

Next, we need to find out how much of the fruit section will be used for strawberries. Since he wants to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries, we calculate:
\( \frac{1}{4} \times 32 \) square feet.

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\( \frac{32}{4} = 8 \) square feet.

Therefore, 8 square feet of the garden will be used for strawberries.

Next, he wants to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries. Since each quarter represents 1/4, we calculate:

Therefore, 8 square feet of the garden will be used for strawberries.

To find out how many square feet Joel will use for strawberries, we'll follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out the size of the fruit section, which is half of the garden.

Let's start by converting the size of the garden into feet:
64 square feet ÷ 2 = 32 square feet

So, Joel will use 32 square feet for fruits.

Next, we need to find out how much of this fruit section will be used for strawberries, which is a quarter of the fruit section.

32 square feet ÷ 4 = 8 square feet

Therefore, Joel will use 8 square feet of the fruit section for strawberries.
