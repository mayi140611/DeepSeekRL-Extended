#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the size of Benedict's house as \( V \) square feet. According to the given information, Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house. We know that Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 10000 = 4V + 600 \]

To find the value of \( V \), we need to isolate \( V \) on one side of the equation. First, subtract 600 from both sides:
\[ 10000 - 600 = 4V \]
\[ 9400 = 4V \]

Next, divide both sides by 4:
\[ V = \frac{9400}{4} \]
\[ V = 2350 \]

So, Benedict's house is 2350 square feet.

Let's denote the size of Benedict's house as \( B \) square feet.

According to the information given, Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times the size of Benedict's house. We know that Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4B + 600 = 10000 \]

Now we can solve for \( B \):

\[ 4B = 10000 - 600 \]
\[ 4B = 9400 \]
\[ B = \frac{9400}{4} \]
\[ B = 2350 \]

So, Benedict's house is 2350 square feet.

Let \( B \) represent the square footage of Benedict's house in square feet.

According to the problem, Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house. We know Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ K = 4B + 600 \]

Given \( K = 10000 \), substitute:
\[ 10000 = 4B + 600 \]

To solve for \( B \), subtract 600 from both sides:
\[ 10000 - 600 = 4B \]
\[ 9400 = 4B \]

Now, divide both sides by 4:
\[ B = \frac{9400}{4} \]
\[ B = 2350 \]

So, Benedict's house is 2350 square feet.

Let's reason through this step by step:

1. We know Kennedy's house is 10,000 square feet.
2. Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house.
3. Let's denote Benedict's house size by 'B'.
4. According to the given information, we can set up the equation:
   10000 = 4B + 600
5. Now, let's solve for 'B':
   10000 - 600 = 4B
   9400 = 4B
   B = 9400 / 4
   B = 2350 square feet

Therefore, Benedict's house is 2350 square feet.

Let's denote the size of Benedict's house by \( B \) square feet.

According to the information given, Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ 10000 = 4B + 600 \]

To find the size of Benedict's house, we need to solve for \( B \):

system
Let \( K \) represent the size of Kennedy's house and \( B \) represent the size of Benedict's house. According to the given information, we have two key pieces of data:

1. Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house:
   \[
   K = 4B + 600
   \]

2. Kennedy's house is 10,000 square feet:
   \[
   K = 10,000
   \]

To find the size of Benedict's house, we substitute \( K = 10,000 \) into the first equation:

\[
10,000 = 4B + 600
\]

Next, we solve for \( B \):

1. Subtract 600 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   10,000 - 600 = 4B
   \]

2. Simplify the left side:
   \[
   9,400 = 4B
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{9,400}{4}
   \]

4. Perform the division:
   \[
   B = 2,350
   \]

Therefore, Benedictâ€™s house is 2,350 square feet.
