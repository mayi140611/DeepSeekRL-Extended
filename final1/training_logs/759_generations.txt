First, we need to determine how much ribbon will be used for all the gifts. Since each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts, the total ribbon used is 2 * 6 = 12 yards.

Given that Josh has 18 yards of ribbon, the ribbon left after using it to wrap the gifts is 18 - 12 = 6 yards.

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon. He divides this ribbon equally among 6 gifts. So each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon. First, we calculate the total ribbon used by 6 gifts:
\[ 6 \text{ gifts} \times 2 \text{ yards/gift} = 12 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we subtract the total ribbon used from the original amount:
\[ 18 \text{ yards} - 12 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left after giving equal amounts to the 6 gifts.

To determine how many yards of ribbon will be left after distributing the ribbon equally among the gifts, we start by finding out how much ribbon is used for each gift. Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon.

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon in total, and he needs to divide this equally among 6 gifts. So the total number of gifts that will use ribbon is 6. 

The total amount of ribbon used can be calculated by:
\[ \text{Total ribbon used} = \text{Number of gifts} \times \text{Ribbon per gift} \]
\[ \text{Total ribbon used} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we will subtract the total ribbon used from the initial total ribbon to calculate the remaining ribbon:
\[ \text{Remaining ribbon} = \text{Initial ribbon} - \text{Total ribbon used}
\[ \text{Remaining ribbon} = 18 - 12 = 6 \text{ yards} \]

So, there will be 6 yards of ribbon left.

To find out how many yards of ribbon will be left, we first need to determine how much ribbon each gift will use. Each of the 6 gifts will use 2 yards of ribbon, so in total, 6 gifts will use \(6 \times 2 = 12\) yards of ribbon. Josh has 18 yards of ribbon, so the remaining ribbon will be \(18 - 12 = 6\) yards.

Josh has a total of 18 yards of ribbon. He wants to divide this ribbon equally among 6 gifts, with each gift using 2 yards of ribbon. To find out how many yards each gift will use, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon per gift: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Since Josh has 18 yards and each gift uses 12 yards, we subtract the total used from the total available: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

So, 6 yards of ribbon will be left.

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon in total. He wants to divide it equally among 6 gifts, so first, we calculate the amount of ribbon per gift:
\[
\text{Ribbon per gift} = \frac{\text{Total ribbon}}{\text{Number of gifts}} = \frac{18 \text{ yards}}{6}
\]

Calculating the division:
\[
\text{Ribbon per gift} = 3 \text{ yards}
\]

Since each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon and we have calculated that each gift gets 3 yards, there is a discrepancy. Letâ€™s determine if there is any leftover ribbon. We will take the total given and subtract the total used for the gifts:

\[
\text{Total used} = \text{Ribbon per gift} \times \text{Number of gifts} = 3 \text{ yards} \times 6 = 18 \text{ yards}
\]

Since the total ribbon provided (18 yards) exactly matches the total used (18 yards), there is no ribbon left.

To find out how many yards of ribbon will be left, we first need to determine the total amount of ribbon that will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, we can calculate the total ribbon used by multiplying 2 by 6:

2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards

Now, we know Josh has 18 yards of ribbon and will use 12 yards for the gifts. To find out how much ribbon will be left, we subtract the used ribbon from the total ribbon:

18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards

So, 6 yards of ribbon will be left.

First, we need to determine the total amount of ribbon each gift is to use. Since each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon and there are 6 gifts, the total ribbon used is \(2 \, \text{yards/gift} \times 6 \, \text{gifts} = 12 \, \text{yards}\).

Now, subtract the total ribbon used from the initial amount of ribbon to find the leftover ribbon:

To determine how many yards of ribbon will be left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of ribbon used for the gifts.
2. Subtract the total ribbon used from the initial amount of ribbon.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of ribbon used for the gifts.
Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
\[ 2 \text{ yards/gift} \times 6 \text{ gifts} = 12 \text{ yards} \]

Step 2: Subtract the total ribbon used from the initial amount of ribbon.
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon initially.
\[ 18 \text{ yards} - 12 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the number of yards of ribbon that will be left is 6.
