To find the final cost of the dress, we first need to calculate the discount amount. The store is offering a 30% discount on everything.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   \( \text{Discount amount} = \text{Original price} \times \text{Discount rate} \)
   \( \text{Discount amount} = \$50 \times 0.30 \)
   \( \text{Discount amount} = \$15 \)

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final cost:
   \( \text{Final cost} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount amount} \)
   \( \text{Final cost} = \$50 - \$15 \)
   \( \text{Final cost} = \$35 \)

So the final cost of the dress is \$35.

To find the final cost of the dress after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the discount: The dress is $50, and the store is offering 30% off. 
   Discount = (30/100) * $50 = $15
   (This means the dress is currently priced at $50 - $15 = $35.)

2. Calculate the final cost: The discounted price of the dress is $35.

So, the final cost of the dress is $35.

The store is offering a 30% discount on the dress. First, we need to calculate 30% of the original price, which is $50.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 50 \times \frac{30}{100} = 50 \times 0.30 = \$15 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final cost:

\[ \text{Final cost} = 50 - 15 = \$35 \]

To find the final cost of the dress, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the dress is $50. The store is offering a 30% discount.

To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

$50 * 30% = $50 * 0.30 = $15

So, the dress has a $15 discount.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost:

$50 - $15 = $35

Therefore, the final cost of the dress is $35.

First, let's calculate the discount amount:
The original price of the dress is $50. The store is offering a 30% discount.
Discount amount = Original price * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $50 * 0.30
Discount amount = $15

Now, let's subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost:
Final cost = Original price - Discount amount
Final cost = $50 - $15
Final cost = $35

To find the final cost of the dress, we first need to calculate the discount amount. Since the store is offering a 30% discount on everything, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = Price of the dress x Discount rate
                 = $50 x 0.30
                 = $15

So the discount amount is $15. 

To find the final cost of the dress, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

Final cost = Original price - Discount amount
          = $50 - $15
          = $35

Therefore, the final cost of the dress is $35.

To find the final cost of the dress after a 30% discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount on the original price of the dress. 

The original price of the dress is $50. A 30% discount means that Stella will pay 70% of the original price (100% - 30% = 70%).

So, the discount amount is:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 50 \times \frac{30}{100} = 50 \times 0.30 = 15 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final cost of the dress:
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 50 - 15 = 35 \]

Therefore, the final cost of the dress is $35.

To find the final cost of the dress, we need to calculate the discount first and then subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the dress is $50. The store is offering a 30% discount, which means the dress is now 70% of its original price (100% - 30% discount = 70% remaining).

We calculate the discount amount by taking 30% of $50:
\[ 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \]

Subtract this discount amount from the original price to find the final cost:
\[ 50 - 15 = 35 \]

So, the final cost of the dress is $35.
