Let's calculate the variables:

- Ravi has 6 nickels.
- Since he has 2 more quarters than nickels, he has 6 + 2 = 8 quarters.
- He has 4 more dimes than quarters, so he has 8 + 4 = 12 dimes.

Next, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 6 nickels are worth 6 * 5 = 30 cents.
- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 8 quarters are worth 8 * 25 = 200 cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 12 dimes are worth 12 * 10 = 120 cents.

Finally, let's add up the total value:

30 cents (nickels) + 200 cents (quarters) + 120 cents (dimes) = 350 cents.

Therefore, Ravi has 350 cents or $3.50.

Ravi has 6 nickels, which means he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) quarters (since he has 2 more quarters than nickels). He also has \(8 + 4 = 12\) dimes (since he has 4 more dimes than quarters).

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 6 nickels are worth \(6 \times 5 = 30\) cents.
Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 12 dimes are worth \(12 \times 10 = 120\) cents.

Adding it up, Ravi has \(200 + 30 + 120 = 350\) cents, which is $3.50.

Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 quarters. He has 4 more dimes than quarters, so he has 8 + 4 = 12 dimes. Now we can calculate how much money he has. A nickel is worth $0.05, so 6 nickels are worth 6 * $0.05 = $0.30. A quarter is worth $0.25, so 8 quarters are worth 8 * $0.25 = $2.00. A dime is worth $0.10, so 12 dimes are worth 12 * $0.10 = $1.20. In total, Ravi has $0.30 + $2.00 + $1.20 = $3.50.

Ravi has 6 nickels. He has 2 more quarters than nickels, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 quarters. He has 4 more dimes than quarters, so he has 8 + 4 = 12 dimes.

The value of one nickel is $0.05, so the total value of the nickels is 6 * $0.05 = $0.30.

The value of one quarter is $0.25, so the total value of the quarters is 8 * $0.25 = $2.00.

The value of one dime is $0.10, so the total value of the dimes is 12 * $0.10 = $1.20.

The total amount of money Ravi has is $0.30 (nickels) + $2.00 (quarters) + $1.20 (dimes) = $3.50.

Let's denote the number of nickels Ravi has as \( N \), the number of quarters as \( Q \), and the number of dimes as \( D \).

Given:
- Ravi has 6 nickels.
- He has 2 more quarters than nickels.
- He has 4 more dimes than quarters.

We can write the following equations based on the given information:
\[ N = 6 \]
\[ Q = N + 2 \]
\[ D = Q + 4 \]

Let's substitute the known value of \( N \) into the equations:
\[ Q = 6 + 2 = 8 \]
\[ D = 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Now, we calculate the money each type of coin represents:
- Each nickel is worth $0.05.
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Each dime is worth $0.10.

The total value of the nickels:
\[ Value_{nickels} = 6 \times 0.05 = 0.30 \text{ dollars} \]

The total value of the quarters:
\[ Value_{quarters} = 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The total value of the dimes:
\[ Value_{dimes} = 12 \times 0.10 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now we sum up the values to find the total amount of money:
\[ Total\_value = Value_{nickels} + Value_{quarters} + Value_{dimes} \]
\[ Total\_value = 0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 \]
\[ Total\_value = 3.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Ravi has is:

The number of quarters Ravi has is 2 more than the number of nickels, which means he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) quarters.

The number of dimes Ravi has is 4 more than the number of quarters, which means he has \(8 + 4 = 12\) dimes.

Each nickel is worth $0.05, each quarter is worth $0.25, and each dime is worth $0.10.

So, the total amount of money from nickels is \(6 \times 0.05 = 0.30\) dollars.

The total amount of money from quarters is \(8 \times 0.25 = 2.00\) dollars.

The total amount of money from dimes is \(12 \times 0.10 = 1.20\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, Ravi has a total of \(0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 = 3.50\) dollars.

Let's calculate step by step.

First, we know that Ravi has 6 nickels.

Next, according to the problem, he has 2 more quarters than nickels. So, the number of quarters he has is:
\[ \text{Number of quarters} = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Since he has 4 more dimes than quarters, the number of dimes he has is:
\[ \text{Number of dimes} = 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate the money from each type of coin:
- A nickel is worth $0.05, so 6 nickels are worth:
  \[ 6 \times 0.05 = \$0.30 \]

- A quarter is worth $0.25, so 8 quarters are worth:
  \[ 8 \times 0.25 = \$2.00 \]

- A dime is worth $0.10, so 12 dimes are worth:
  \[ 12 \times 0.10 = \$1.20 \]

Finally, we add up the value of all the coins to find the total amount of money Ravi has:
\[ \text{Total money} = 0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 = \$3.50 \]

So, Ravi has $3.50 in total.
