#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Initially, Emily has 6 marbles. Megan gives Emily double the number she has, which is 6 * 2 = 12 marbles. Emily's new total is 6 + 12 = 18 marbles.

Emily then gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1. Half of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9. Adding 1 more gives 9 + 1 = 10 marbles.

Now Emily has 18 - 10 = 8 marbles.

system
First, let's calculate how many marbles Megan gives Emily. Since Megan gives Emily double the number of marbles she has, Megan gives Emily:

\( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) marbles.

After receiving these marbles, Emily has:

\( 6 + 12 = 18 \) marbles.

Now, Emily gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1. Half of 18 is 9, so Emily returns:

\( 9 + 1 = 10 \) marbles to Megan.

Finally, Emily has:

\( 18 - 10 = 8 \) marbles.

Initially, Emily has 6 marbles. Megan gives Emily double the number she has, which is 2 * 6 = 12 marbles.

After receiving these marbles, Emily's total number of marbles is 6 (initially) + 12 (from Megan) = 18 marbles.

Then, Emily gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1. Half of her new total is 18 / 2 = 9, and adding 1 gives 9 + 1 = 10 marbles.

Now, subtract the 10 marbles given back from the 18 marbles Emily had after receiving the new ones:

18 (total after receiving from Megan) - 10 (marbles given back) = 8 marbles.

So, Emily has 8 marbles now.

Emily originally has 6 marbles. Megan gives her double the number she has, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) marbles. Now, Emily has \(6 + 12 = 18\) marbles. 

Emily then gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1. Half of 18 is \(18 / 2 = 9\), and adding 1 gives \(9 + 1 = 10\) marbles. So, Megan gets 10 marbles back.

Emily now has \(18 - 10 = 8\) marbles.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Emily initially has 6 marbles.
2. Megan gives Emily double the number she has. So, Megan gives Emily \(2 \times 6 = 12\) marbles.
3. Now, Emily has \(6 + 12 = 18\) marbles.
4. Emily gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1. Half of 18 is \(18 / 2 = 9\), so she gives Megan \(9 + 1 = 10\) marbles back.

Emily's final number of marbles is \(18 - 10 = 8\).

Emily initially has 6 marbles. Megan gives her double the number she has, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) marbles. Adding this to her initial 6 marbles, Emily now has \(6 + 12 = 18\) marbles.

Emily then gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1. Half of 18 is \(18 / 2 = 9\), and adding 1 gives \(9 + 1 = 10\).

Therefore, Emily gives Megan 10 marbles. To find out how many marbles Emily has now, we subtract the 10 marbles she gave Megan from her new total of 18 marbles: \(18 - 10 = 8\).

Initially, Emily has 6 marbles. Megan gives her double this amount, which is 2 * 6 = 12 marbles. After receiving from Megan, Emily has 6 + 12 = 18 marbles. Next, Emily gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1 marble. Half of 18 is 8.5, and adding 1 gives 9.5. Since Emily can't give half a marble, we consider the practical scenario where she gives 9 marbles back to Megan. So, Emily has 18 - 9 = 9 marbles.

Initial number of marbles Emily has: 6

Megan gives Emily double the number she has, so Megan gives Emily 2 * 6 = 12 marbles.

After receiving 12 marbles from Megan, Emily now has 6 + 12 = 18 marbles.

Emily then gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1, so she gives Megan (18 / 2) + 1 = 10 marbles.

Subtracting the 10 marbles she gave to Megan from her current total, Emily has 18 - 10 = 8 marbles left.

To determine how many marbles Emily has after the transactions, let's follow the steps one by one:

1. Emily starts with 6 marbles.
2. Megan gives Emily double the number she has currently, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) marbles. So now Emily has \(6 + 12 = 18\) marbles.
3. Emily then gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1. Half of her new total is \(18 / 2 = 9\), plus 1 gives \(9 + 1 = 10\). So Emily gives Megan 10 marbles.

Subtracting the 10 marbles she gave away from her current total:
\(18 - 10 = 8\)

So, Emily now has 8 marbles.

Emily initially has 6 marbles. Megan gives her double the number she has, which means Megan gives Emily 6 * 2 = 12 marbles. Adding these to her original amount, Emily now has 6 + 12 = 18 marbles.

Emily then gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1. Half of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9. Adding 1 to this gives 9 + 1 = 10 marbles. Therefore, Emily gives Megan 10 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Emily has now, we subtract the 10 marbles she gave away from her total of 18: 18 - 10 = 8 marbles.
