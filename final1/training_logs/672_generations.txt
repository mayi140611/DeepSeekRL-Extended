To calculate how much John pays for the pills in a 30-day month, we first need to determine the total cost for the pills in a day, consider the insurance coverage, and then extend that to a 30-day period.

1. Calculate the total cost for the pills in a day:
   - John takes 2 pills per day.
   - Each pill costs $1.5.
   - Therefore, the daily cost is \(2 \times 1.5 = $3.\)

2. Calculate the insurance portion of the cost:
   - The insurance covers 40% of the cost, so John pays 60% of the cost.
   - The insurance covers \(0.4 \times 3 = $1.2\).
   - John's out-of-pocket cost for the pills in a day is \(3 - 1.2 = $1.8\).

3. Calculate the total cost for the pills in a 30-day month:
   - John pays $1.8 per day.
   - There are 30 days in a 30-day month.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(1.8 \times 30 = $54\).

To find out how much John pays for pills in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost for 30 days without insurance:**
   John needs 2 pills a day, and each pill costs $1.5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost without insurance per day} = 2 \text{ pills/day} \times \$1.5/\text{pill} = \$3.0\text{ per day}
   \]
   For 30 days:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without insurance in 30 days} = \$3.0/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$90.0
   \]

2. **Calculate the insurance coverage:**
   The insurance covers 40% of the cost.
   \[
   \text{Insurance coverage} = 40\% \text{ of } \$90.0 = 0.4 \times 90.0 = \$36.0
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount John pays after insurance:**
   Subtract the insurance coverage from the total cost without insurance.
   \[
   \text{Amount John pays} = \text{Total cost without insurance} - \text{Insurance coverage} = \$90.0 - \$36.0 = \$54.0
   \]

So, John pays $54.0 for pills in a 30-day month.

John needs to take 2 pills a day and each pill costs $1.5. Therefore, the daily cost for the pills is 2 * $1.5 = $3. Since the insurance covers 40% of the cost, John has to pay 60% of the cost, which is 100% - 40% = 60%.
The total cost for 30 days is $3/day * 30 days = $90.
So, John has to pay $90 * 60% = $54 for the pills in a 30-day month.

John needs to take 2 pills a day, so in a 30-day month, he will need to take 2 * 30 = 60 pills.
The cost of one pill is $1.5, so the total cost of the pills in a month is 60 * $1.5 = $90.
The insurance covers 40% of the cost, so John will need to pay 100% - 40% = 60% of the cost.
Therefore, John will need to pay 60% of $90, which is 0.6 * $90 = $54.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of pills John needs to take in a 30-day month. Since John needs to take 2 pills a day, the number of pills he needs in a month is 2 pills/day * 30 days = 60 pills.
Next, we find out how much the insurance covers. With an insurance coverage of 40%, John only needs to pay 60 pills * $1.5/pill * 60% = $54.
John pays the remaining cost of the insurance covered amount, which is $1.5/pill * 60 pills = $90.
Therefore, John's total payment in a 30-day month is $54 + $90 = $144.

To calculate how much John pays in a 30-day month, we can break this down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total cost of the pills John needs to buy in a month:
   John takes 2 pills a day, so in 30 days, he needs:
   \( 2 \, \text{pills/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{pills} \).

2. Each pill costs $1.5, so for 60 pills, the total cost before insurance is:
   \( \$1.5 \, \text{per pill} \times 60 \, \text{pills} = \$90 \).

3. The insurance covers 40% of the cost, so John needs to pay the remaining 60%. The amount John pays is:
   \( \$90 \times 0.60 = \$54 \).

Therefore, John pays $54 for his pills in a 30-day month.

Let's calculate the total cost of the pills for a 30-day month.

1. Calculate the daily cost of the pills:
   John takes 2 pills a day, and each pill costs $1.5.
   $1.5/pill * 2 pills/day = $3/day

2. Calculate the monthly cost of the pills:
   John takes the pills daily, so in a 30-day month, he will take:
   2 pills/day * 30 days = 60 pills
   $3/day * 60 days = $180/month

3. Calculate the insurance coverage:
   The insurance covers 40% of the cost.
   40% of $180 = 0.40 * $180 = $72

4. Calculate how much John has to pay:
   The total cost after insurance:
   $180 (total cost) - $72 (insurance coverage) = $108

So, John pays $108 in a 30-day month.

First, calculate the total cost of the pills without insurance coverage. John needs to take 2 pills a day, which means he needs 2 pills × 30 days = 60 pills per month. Each pill costs $1.5, so the total cost for 60 pills is 60 × $1.5 = $90. The insurance covers 40% of the cost, so John is responsible for 100% - 40% = 60% of the cost. Therefore, John pays 60% of $90, which is 0.6 × $90.

Next, calculate the amount John pays for the 30-day month.

To determine how much John pays for his pills in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the pills for 30 days.
2. Determine the amount covered by the insurance.
3. Calculate the remaining amount that John has to pay.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the pills for 30 days.
John takes 2 pills a day, and each pill costs $1.5.
Total cost per day = 2 pills/day * $1.5/pill = $3/day
Total cost for 30 days = $3/day * 30 days = $90

Step 2: Determine the amount covered by the insurance.
The insurance covers 40% of the cost.
Amount covered by insurance = 40% of $90 = 0.40 * $90 = $36

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount that John has to pay.
Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount covered by insurance
Remaining amount = $90 - $36 = $54

Therefore, John pays $54 in a 30-day month for his pills.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the pills without insurance. John takes 2 pills a day, and each pill costs $1.5. So, the daily cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pills/day} \times \$1.50/\text{pill} = \$3.00/\text{day} \]

Over a 30-day month, the total cost without insurance would be:
\[ \$3.00/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$90.00 \]

The insurance covers 40% of the cost, so John needs to pay 60% of the total cost:

Therefore, John pays \$54.00 in a 30-day month.
