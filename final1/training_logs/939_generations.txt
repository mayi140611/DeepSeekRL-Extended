Javier needs to raise $96 in total. Each dozen donuts costs $2.40, so Javier needs to make $96 / $2.40 = 40 dozens of donuts in total.

Since a dozen has 12 donuts, Javier needs to sell 40 x 12 = 480 donuts to reach his goal.

However, Javier needs to sell each donut for $1 to make a profit. So, he needs to sell 480 / 1 = 480 donuts to sell every dozen he buys.

To find out how many dozen donuts he needs to buy, we divide the total number of donuts needed to be sold by the number of donuts in a dozen.

Javier needs to buy 480 / 12 = 40 dozens of donuts.

Now, let's check if this is the number needed to reach his goal after accounting for his cost. If he buys 40 dozens, he spends 40 x $2.40 = $96. This fits within his desired goal of raising $96.

Hence, Javier needs to buy 40 dozens of donuts to raise $96, considering he also needs to sell all of them at $1 each to cover expenses.

To determine how many dozen donuts Javier needs to buy and sell to reach his goal of raising $96, we can set up an equation based on the cost and the selling price.

First, we calculate the profit per dozen donuts Javier makes:
- The cost of one dozen donuts is $2.40.
- The selling price of one donut is $1.
- Therefore, the profit per donut is $1 - $0.20 = $0.80.
- Since one dozen is 12 donuts, the profit per dozen donuts is $0.80 \times 12 = $9.60.

Next, we determine how many dozens of donuts Javier needs to sell to make a total profit of $96:
\[ \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{\text{Total goal}}{\text{Profit per dozen}} = \frac{96}{9.60} = 10 \]
So, Javier needs to sell 10 dozen donuts to reach his goal.

To find out how many dozen donuts Javier needs to buy and sell to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Javier's profit per dozen donuts:
   Profit per dozen = Selling price per dozen - Buying price per dozen
                    = $1 per donut * 12 donuts - $2.40 per dozen
                    = $12 - $2.40
                    = $9.60 per dozen

2. Determine the number of dozens Javier needs to sell to reach his goal:
   Donuts needed = Goal / (Profit per dozen / 1 dozen)
                 = $96 / ($9.60 per dozen / 1 dozen)
                 = $96 / $9.60
                 = 10

Thus, Javier needs to buy and sell 10 dozen donuts to reach his goal of $96.

Javier needs to raise $96. Each dozen donuts costs $2.40, and he sells each donut for $1, so each dozen donuts give him $2.40 - $1 = $1.40 profit. If he wants to raise $96, then he needs to make $96 / $1.40 = 68 dozen donuts. However, he can only buy whole dozens of donuts, so he needs to buy 69 dozens of donuts to reach his goal.

First, we need to determine the profit per donut Javier makes by selling each donut for $1 and buying donuts for $2.40 per dozen. A dozen contains 12 donuts.

1 dozen donuts = $2.40
So, the cost per donut is:
Cost per donut = $2.40 / 12 = $0.20

Profit per donut = Selling price - Cost per donut
Profit per donut = $1 - $0.20 = $0.80

Next, we calculate how many donuts he needs to sell to raise $96:
Number of donuts = Total money goal / Profit per donut
Number of donuts = $96 / $0.80 = 120 donuts

Finally, we calculate the number of dozens needed to reach 120 donuts:
Number of dozens = Number of donuts / 12
Number of dozens = 120 / 12 = 10 dozens

So, Javier needs to buy and sell 10 dozen donuts.

Let's calculate the cost per donut first. Since Javier buys each dozen donuts for $2.40, we need to find out what the cost of one donut is. This is done by dividing the cost of the dozen by 12, which is $2.40 / 12 = $0.20 per donut.

Javier then sells each donut for $1. So, for every dozen donuts sold, he earns $1 x 12 = $12. To reach his goal of $96, we divide his goal by the profit per dozen donuts: $96 / $12 = 8 dozens. Therefore, Javier needs to buy and sell 8 dozen donuts.

To determine how many dozen donuts Javier needs to buy and sell to reach his goal of raising $96, we can start by calculating the profit he makes from selling each donut.

1 dozen donuts consists of 12 donuts. The cost of each dozen donuts is $2.40. Therefore, the profit Javier makes from selling one dozen donuts is:
\[ \text{Profit per dozen} = 12 \times (1 - 0.24) = 12 \times 0.76 = 9.12 \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of donuts Javier needs to sell in order to raise $96:
\[ \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{96}{9.12} \approx 10.48 \]

Since Javier cannot sell a fraction of a dozen and needs to raise exactly $96, he has to round up to the nearest whole number. Thus, Javier needs to buy and sell 11 dozen donuts.

To verify, we calculate the total revenue from selling 11 dozen donuts and the cost:
- Revenue from 11 dozen: \( 11 \times 9.12 = 100.32 \)
- Cost of 11 dozen: \( 11 \times 2.40 = 26.40 \)

Therefore, Javier's profit:
\[ 100.32 - 26.40 = 73.92 \]

This is less than $96, so it confirms that 11 dozen is needed to exceed his goal.

To determine how many dozen donuts Javier needs to buy and sell to reach his goal of $96, we start by calculating the profit Javier makes from each dozen donuts.

Each dozen donuts cost Javier $2.40 to buy. Javier sells each donut for $1, so he sells each dozen donuts for $12 (since there are 12 donuts in a dozen). The profit from selling each dozen donuts is $12 - $2.40 = $9.60. 

To find out how many dozen donuts Javier needs to sell to reach his goal of $96, we divide his goal by his profit per dozen donuts: 
$$
\frac{96}{9.60} = 10
$$
So Javier needs to sell 10 dozen donuts to reach his goal. 

Since each dozen consists of 12 donuts, Javier needs to buy:
$$
10 \times 12 = 120
$$
Therefore, Javier needs to buy and sell a total of 10 dozen donuts to reach his goal of $96.

First, we need to determine how much money Javier makes from selling each donut. He sells each donut for $1.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of each dozen donuts. He buys each dozen donuts for $2.40.

To determine the total profit Javier makes from selling one dozen donuts, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $1 (revenue) - $2.40 (cost) = -$1.40 (loss).

Therefore, Javier needs to make up for this loss by selling enough donuts to make up the $96 he wants to raise. 

Let's figure out the number of donuts per dozen:
- Javier buys each dozen for $2.40.

Let's find how much he earns per dozen:
- For each dozen, he earns 12 * $1 = $12.

So, his profit per dozen is $12 - $2.40 = $9.60.

To find out how many dozens he needs to sell to make $96:
- Number of dozens = $96 / $9.60

To find the detailed number of dozens, we can use the following calculation:
\[ \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{96}{9.60} = 10 \]

Finally, since each dozen equals 12 donuts, we have:
\[ \text{Total number of donuts} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \]

Therefore, Javier needs to buy and sell 10 dozen donuts to reach his goal of $96.

First, let's determine the profit that Javier makes from selling each donut. He buys each dozen donuts for $2.40 and sells each donut for $1, so he makes a profit of $1.00 - $0.24 = $0.76 per donut.

Next, we need to calculate the number of dozens of donuts Javier needs to sell to reach his goal of $96. For this, we need to divide $96 by the profit made per dozen, which is $76. Since half a dozen is 0.5, we start by calculating how many dozens he needs before considering the remaining amount:

\[ \text{Dozens needed} = 96 / 76 = 1.26923076923 \]

This number needs to be rounded up because Javier cannot sell a fraction of a dozen, so he needs to buy at least 2 dozens of donuts.

If Javier buys 2 dozens, he will need to make 1.5 times the profit to cover the shortfall:

\[ \text{First dozen profit} = 76 \times 1.5 = 114 \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 96 - 114 = -18 \]

Since the remaining amount is negative, we can see that buying 2 dozens is more than enough. If he bought 2 dozens, he would need an extra $18, which is more than he needs, so he doesn't need to buy any more.

Hence, Javier needs to buy and sell 1.5 dozens of donuts to reach his goal but since he can only buy in whole dozens, he needs to buy and sell 2 dozens.

Javier's goal is to raise $96. Each dozen donuts costs him $2.40, and he sells each donut for $1. First, we need to determine how many donuts are needed to reach his goal by selling donuts at $1 each.

With $96 goal, if each donut is sold for $1, he would need to sell 96 donuts.

Since each dozen contains 12 donuts, the number of dozens needed can be calculated by dividing the total number of donuts by 12. 
Total donuts needed = 96
One dozen = 12 donuts
Number of dozens needed = 96 / 12 = 8 dozens
Therefore, Javier needs to buy and sell 8 dozens of donuts to reach his goal.

Calculating separately: 
1 dozen = 12 donuts
8 dozens = 8 x 12 = 96 donuts
So, by selling all the donuts he bought, he reaches his goal of $96.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Javier buys each dozen donuts for $2.40.
2. He sells each donut for $1.
3. He wants to raise a total of $96.

First, we need to determine how much he makes from selling one dozen donuts. Since he sells each donut for $1, and he buys each dozen for $2.40, he makes $2.40 on each dozen minus the $2.40 cost, which is $2.40 - $2.40 = $0.

However, this is not the correct approach. Let's try another way. If he buys each dozen for $2.40, and each dozen contains 12 donuts, then he spends $2.40 on 12 donuts. So, for every dozen he sells, he makes enough money to buy one more dozen. 

Let's set up the equation. If he buys $x$ dozen for $2.40x$ dollars, he sells $(12x) \times 1 = 12x$ donuts for $12x$ dollars. To break even, he needs to spend $2.40x$ and earn $12x$, so we set up the equation:

\[ 12x = 2.40x \times 96 \]

\[ 12x = 230.40x \]

Dividing both sides by 12x, we get:

\[ 1 = 230.40 \]

This implies that he needs to buy $96 / 230.40 \approx 0.42$ dozen, but since he can only buy in whole dozens, he needs to buy 1 dozen to start. 

From there, for every additional dozen he buys (which he does by selling each donut), he earns enough to buy another dozen. So, he needs to buy 96 / 2.40 = 40 dozens in total to reach his goal.

Therefore, the answer is 40 dozens.

Next, we need to find out how many dozen donuts this is. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, we divide 96 by 12:
\[ 96 \div 12 = 8 \text{ dozens} \]

Javier buys each dozen donuts for $2.40. Thus, to buy and sell 8 dozen donuts, he needs to spend:

To determine how many dozen donuts Javier needs to buy and sell to reach his goal of raising $96, we first need to calculate the profit Javier makes from each dozen donuts after accounting for the cost of buying them. Each dozen donuts costs $2.40 and he sells each for $1, so the profit per dozen is $1 - $2.40 = -$1.60 per dozen. This means that for each dozen, Javier is actually losing $1.60. 

To find out how many dozens he needs to give away to make $96, we divide $96 by the profit per dozen, which is -$1.60. The number of dozens needed is calculated as follows:
$$
\frac{96}{-1.60} = -60
$$
Since he can't sell a negative number of dozens, he needs to give away 60 more dozens (i.e., buy an additional 60 dozens) so he can sell them at a higher profit.

Therefore, Javier needs to buy and sell 61 dozen donuts in total to reach his goal.
