###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Lilah's family gallery has 400 photos. On a two-day trip to the Grand Canyon, they took half as many photos they have in the family's gallery on the first day and 120 more photos than they took on the first day on the second day. If they added all these photos to the family gallery, calculate the total number of photos in the gallery.

On the first day of the trip, they took half of the photos in their gallery, which is 400 / 2 = 200 photos. On the second day, they took 120 more photos than the first day, which is 200 + 120 = 320 photos. So, they took a total of 200 + 320 = 520 photos on the trip.

If they add these photos to the original 400 in the gallery, the total number of photos would be 400 + 520 = 920.

Lilah's family gallery initially has 400 photos. On the first day, they took half as many photos as are in their gallery, which means they took \(400 / 2 = 200\) photos. On the second day, they took 120 more photos than they took on the first day, which means they took \(200 + 120 = 320\) photos. Adding these two days together, they took a total of \(200 + 320 = 520\) photos. If they added all these photos to their already existing gallery, the total number of photos in the gallery would be \(400 + 520 = 920\).

To find the total number of photos in the family gallery after the trip, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of photos taken on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of photos taken on the second day.
3. Add the photos taken on the first and second days to the initial number of photos in the gallery.

Step 1: Calculate the number of photos taken on the first day.
The family took half as many photos on the first day as they have in the gallery. They have 400 photos, so on the first day, they took:
\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ photos} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of photos taken on the second day.
On the second day, they took 120 more photos than they took on the first day. So, on the second day, they took:
\[ 200 + 120 = 320 \text{ photos} \]

Step 3: Add the photos taken on the first and second days to the initial number of photos in the gallery.
The total number of photos in the gallery after the trip is:
\[ 400 + 200 + 320 = 920 \text{ photos} \]

Therefore, the total number of photos in the gallery after the trip is \( \boxed{920} \).

Let's start by determining the number of photos taken on the first day. Given that they took half as many photos on the first day as they have in the family gallery, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of photos on the first day = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200\)

Next, we need to determine the number of photos taken on the second day. They took 120 more photos than they took on the first day:

Number of photos on the second day = 200 + 120 = 320

Now, we calculate the total number of photos taken over the two days:

Total photos taken = Photos on the first day + Photos on the second day = 200 + 320 = 520

Finally, to find the total number of photos in the gallery after adding the new photos, we add the total photos taken over the two days to the original number of photos in the gallery:

Total number of photos in the gallery = Original number of photos + Total photos taken = 400 + 520 = 920

So, the total number of photos in the gallery is 920.
