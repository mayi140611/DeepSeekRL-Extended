###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

The owner of a Turkish restaurant wanted to prepare traditional dishes for an upcoming celebration. She ordered ground beef, in four-pound packages, from three different butchers. The following morning, the first butcher delivered 10 packages. A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcher’s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?

From the first butcher, the owner received 10 packages, each weighing 4 pounds, which is a total weight of 40 pounds of ground beef.
From the second butcher, the owner received 7 packages, each weighing 4 pounds, which is a total weight of 28 pounds of ground beef.
The third butcher delivered the remaining weight of the order, 100 - 40 - 28 = 32 pounds of ground beef.
Since each package from the third butcher weighs 4 pounds, the 32 pounds of ground beef was delivered in 32 / 4 = 8 packages.

The first butcher delivered 10 packages, each weighing 4 pounds, so he delivered 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of ground beef. The second butcher delivered 7 packages, each weighing 4 pounds, so he delivered 7 * 4 = 28 pounds of ground beef. The third butcher delivered the remaining weight of ground beef, which is 100 - 40 - 28 = 32 pounds. Therefore, the third butcher delivered 32 / 4 = 8 packages of ground beef.

The first butcher delivered 10 packages, each weighing 4 pounds. So, the total weight delivered by the first butcher is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) pounds.
The second butcher delivered 7 packages, each weighing 4 pounds. So, the total weight delivered by the second butcher is \(7 \times 4 = 28\) pounds.
The total weight delivered by the first and second butchers is \(40 + 28 = 68\) pounds.
If the total weight of the ground beef delivered by the three butchers is 100 pounds, then the third butcher delivered \(100 - 68 = 32\) pounds.
Since each package weighs 4 pounds, the third butcher delivered \(32 \div 4 = 8\) packages.

The first butcher delivered 10 packages, and each package weighs 4 pounds, so 10 packages * 4 pounds/package = 40 pounds. The second butcher delivered 7 packages, and each package weighs 4 pounds, so 7 packages * 4 pounds/package = 28 pounds. Together, the first and second butchers delivered 40 pounds + 28 pounds = 68 pounds. The ground beef delivered by all three butchers weighed 100 pounds, so the third butcher delivered 100 pounds – 68 pounds = 32 pounds. The third butcher delivered 32 pounds / 4 pounds/package = 8 packages.

The total number of packages delivered by the three butchers is 10 + 7 = 17. Since each package weighs 4 pounds, the total weight of the delivered packages is \(17 \times 4 = 68\) pounds. The total weight that all the packages delivered by the three butchers weigh is 100 pounds, so the total weight of the packages delivered by the third butcher is \(100 - 68 = 32\) pounds. Given that each package weighs 4 pounds, the number of packages ordered by the third butcher is \(32 / 4 = 8\).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first butcher delivered 10 packages.
2. The second butcher delivered 7 packages.

Together, the first and second butchers delivered:
10 + 7 = 17 packages

The total weight of the ground beef delivered by all butchers was 100 pounds. Since the weight per package is not specified, we focus on the number of packages delivered.

The total number of packages delivered is:
17 packages (from the first and second butchers) + some packages from the third butcher = 100 pounds

To find out how many packages the third butcher delivered, we can subtract the number of packages from the first and second butchers from the total number of packages:
100 pounds / 4 pounds per package = 25 packages

Since the first and second butchers delivered 17 packages combined, the third butcher must have delivered:
25 packages (total) - 17 packages (first and second butchers) = 8 packages

Thus, the third butcher delivered 8 packages.

The owner ordered ground beef from three butchers in four-pound packages.

First, let's determine the total number of packages delivered by the first two butchers. The first butcher delivered 10 packages, and the second butcher delivered 7 additional packages. Therefore, the total number of packages from the first and second butchers is:
\[ 10 + 7 = 17 \text{ packages} \]

Next, we note that the total weight of the ground beef delivered by the three butchers is 100 pounds. Each package weighs 4 pounds. Therefore, the total number of packages delivered by all three butchers can be calculated by dividing the total weight by the weight of each package:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ pounds per package}} = 25 \text{ packages} \]

We already determined that the first and second butchers delivered 17 packages. To find the number of packages delivered by the third butcher, we subtract the number of packages from the first two butchers from the total number of packages delivered by all three butchers:
\[ 25 \text{ packages} - 17 \text{ packages} = 8 \text{ packages} \]

Thus, the third butcher delivered \boxed{8} packages.

The total packages delivered by the three butchers is 10 + 7 + the number of packages delivered by the third butcher.

This is equivalent to 17 + the number of packages delivered by the third butcher. If the complete weight of all ground beef delivered is 100 pounds, the total of packages delivered must be 100/4=25 packages.

Therefore, the number of packages delivered by the third butcher is 25 - 17 = 8.

The total weight of the meat delivered by the first and second butchers is 40 + 28 = 68 pounds. Therefore, the third butcher delivered 100 - 68 = 32 pounds of meat.
So the third butcher delivered 32 / 4 = 8 packages of ground beef.

Let's denote the number of packages delivered by the third butcher as \( x \). 

First, we know the total weight of the ground beef:
\[
4 \text{ pounds/package} \times (10 + 7 + x) \text{ packages} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
4 \times (17 + x) = 100
\]

Next, divide both sides by 4 to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
17 + x = 25
\]

Subtract 17 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 25 - 17
\]
\[
x = 8
\]

Therefore, the third butcher delivered \(\boxed{8}\) packages.

The total 100 pounds can be broken into 4-pound packages. So that would be 100/4 = 25 packages.
The first butcher delivered 10 packages and the second butcher 7 packages. Combined that is 10+7 = 17 packages.

The amount of ground beef delivered by the first butcher is 40 pounds (10 packages × 4 lbs/package) and the second butcher delivered 28 pounds of ground beef (7 packages × 4 lbs/package). Since the three butchers delivered in all 100 pounds, the third butcher delivered 12 pounds or 3 packages (100 pounds - 40 pounds - 28 pounds = 30 pounds; 30 pounds ÷ 4 lbs/package = 7.5 packages; 7.5 packages = 3 packages).

The total weight of the ground beef delivered by all three butchers is 100 pounds. The first butcher delivered 10 packages, each weighing 4 pounds. Therefore, the total weight from the first butcher is 10 packages * 4 pounds/package = 40 pounds. The second butcher delivered 7 packages, each weighing 4 pounds. Thus, the total weight from the second butcher is 7 packages * 4 pounds/package = 28 pounds. The total weight from the first and second butchers is 40 pounds (from the first butcher) plus 28 pounds (from the second butcher) = 68 pounds. To find the weight of the third butcher's delivery, we subtract the total weight from the first two butchers from the total weight of all deliveries: 100 pounds - 68 pounds = 32 pounds. Each package weighs 4 pounds, so to find the number of packages the third butcher delivered, we divide the total weight of his delivery by the weight per package: 32 pounds / 4 pounds/package = 8 packages. The third butcher delivered 8 packages.
