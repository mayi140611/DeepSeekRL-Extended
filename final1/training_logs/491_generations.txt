system
To find how many Judges are over 50 years old, we first calculate the number of Judges in each age group based on the percentages given.

1. **Number of Judges under 30 years old:**
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{10}{100} \times 40 = 4 \text{ Judges}
   \]

2. **Number of Judges 30-50 years old:**
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24 \text{ Judges}
   \]

3. **Number of Judges over 50 years old:**
   Since there are 40 Judges in total, we subtract the number of Judges under 30 and 30-50 years old from the total:
   \[
   40 - 4 - 24 = 12 \text{ Judges}
   \]

So, there are 12 Judges over 50 years old.

system
To find the number of judges who are over 50 years old, we first need to calculate the number of judges in the "under 30" age group, the "30-50" age group, and finally, subtract these from the total number of judges.

Given that there are 40 Judges in total:

1. The number of judges under 30 years old is 10% of 40:
   \[ 10\% \times 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ Judges} \]

2. The number of judges 30-50 years old is 60% of 40:
   \[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ Judges} \]

3. Now we can calculate the number of judges over 50 years old:
   \[ \text{Total judges} - (\text{Under 30} + \text{30-50}) = 40 - (4 + 24) = 40 - 28 = 12 \text{ Judges} \]

To determine how many judges are over 50 years old, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of judges under 30 years old:
   10% of 40 judges = 0.10 * 40 = 4 judges

2. Calculate the number of judges 30-50 years old:
   60% of 40 judges = 0.60 * 40 = 24 judges

3. The remaining judges must be over 50 years old. First, find the percentage of judges that fall into this category:
   100% - 10% (under 30) - 60% (30-50) = 30%

4. Calculate the number of judges over 50 years old:
   30% of 40 judges = 0.30 * 40 = 12 judges

Therefore, the answer is 12 judges.

To determine how many judges are over 50 years old, we start by calculating the number of judges under 30 years old and those between 30 and 50 years old.

1. First, calculate the number of judges under 30 years old:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ judges} \]

2. Next, calculate the number of judges between 30 and 50 years old:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ judges} \]

3. Now, sum the number of judges under 30 years old and between 30 and 50 years old:
\[ 4 \text{ judges} + 24 \text{ judges} = 28 \text{ judges} \]

4. Finally, subtract this total from the overall number of judges to find the number of judges over 50 years old:
\[ 40 \text{ judges} - 28 \text{ judges} = 12 \text{ judges} \]

So, 12 judges are over 50 years old.

To find out how many judges are over 50 years old, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of Judges under 30 years old**:
   - 10 percent of the 40 Judges are under 30.
   - \( 10\% \times 40 = \frac{10}{100} \times 40 = 4 \) Judges are under 30.

2. **Determine the number of Judges between 30 and 50 years old**:
   - 60 percent of the 40 Judges are 30-50 years old.
   - \( 60\% \times 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24 \) Judges are 30-50 years old.

3. **Calculate the number of Judges over 50 years old**:
   - The total number of judges is 40.
   - The number of judges under 30 is 4.
   - The number of judges between 30 and 50 is 24.
   - Therefore, the number of judges over 50 is:
     \( 40 - 4 - 24 = 12 \) Judges are over 50.

To find out how many Judges are over 50 years old, we can start by calculating the number of Judges under 30 years old. 

10% of 40 Judges is:
\( 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \) Judges under 30 years old.

Next, we know that 60% of Judges are 30-50 years old:

60% of 40 Judges is:
\( 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \) Judges between 30-50 years old.

Now, we can find the number of Judges who are over 50 years old by subtracting the number of judges under 30 and the number of judges between 30-50 from the total number of Judges:

To find the number of Judges over 50 years old, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the number of Judges who are under 30 years old. Since 10 percent of the Judges are under 30, we multiply 40 by 10 percent:
   \[
   40 \times 0.10 = 4
   \]
   So, there are 4 Judges under 30 years old.

2. Next, calculate the number of Judges who are 30-50 years old. Since 60 percent of the Judges are 30-50, we multiply 40 by 60 percent:
   \[
   40 \times 0.60 = 24
   \]
   So, there are 24 Judges who are 30-50 years old.

3. Finally, to find the number of Judges over 50 years old, we subtract the number of Judges under 30 and the number of Judges who are 30-50 from the total number of Judges:
   \[
   40 - 4 - 24 = 12
   \]

So, there are 12 Judges over 50 years old.

To find out how many judges are over 50 years old, we can start by calculating the number of judges who are under 30 years old and those who are between 30 and 50 years old.

To find out how many judges are over 50 years old, first calculate the number of judges under 30 years old and the number of judges between 30-50 years old.

10 percent of 40 judges are under 30 years old:
\( 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \)

60 percent of 40 judges are between 30-50 years old:

Now, we can find the number of judges over 50 years old by subtracting the already calculated judges under 30 and 30-50 years old from the total number of judges.

Total number of judges = 40
Number of judges under 30 = 4
Number of judges between 30-50 = 24

Number of judges over 50 = Total - Under 30 - 30-50
\( = 40 - 4 - 24 \)
\( = 40 - 28 \)
