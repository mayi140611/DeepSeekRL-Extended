###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Luna, the poodle, is supposed to eat 2 cups of kibble every day.  But Luna's master, Mary, and her husband, Frank, sometimes feed Luna too much kibble.  One day, starting with a new, 12-cup bag of kibble, Mary gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the morning and 1 cup of kibble in the evening, But on the same day, Frank also gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening as he had given Luna in the afternoon.  The next morning, how many cups of kibble will Mary find remaining in the bag?

Let's break down the pattern of each person's feeding Luna:

1. **Mary's feeding pattern**:  
   - In the morning: 1 cup of kibble
   - In the evening: 1 cup of kibble

2. **Frank's feeding pattern**:  
   - In the afternoon: 1 cup of kibble
   - In the late evening: 2 times as much as in the afternoon, which is 2 cups.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of kibble each person gave Luna for that day:

- **Mary's total**: \(1 + 1 = 2\) cups
- **Frank's total**: \(1 + 2 = 3\) cups

Adding these together gives the total amount of kibble that was given to Luna that day: \(2 + 3 = 5\) cups.

Mary originally had a 12-cup bag of kibble. Subtracting the 5 cups given to Luna leaves: \(12 - 5 = 7\) cups remaining.

However, this calculation only considers the total given to Luna, not the remaining kibble. Therefore, to find how many cups of kibble are left in the bag the next morning, we need to subtract the total given from the starting amount:

- Initial amount of kibble: 12 cups
- Kibble given to Luna: 5 cups

So, the amount of kibble left in the bag the next morning is: \(12 - 5 = 7\) cups.

Luna should eat 2 cups of kibble per day. Mary gave Luna 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening. So, Mary gave Luna a total of 1 + 1 = 2 cups of kibble. Frank gave Luna 1 cup in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening, which is 1 * 2 = 2 cups. In total, Luna consumed 2 + (1 + 2) = 5 cups of kibble. Starting with a new 12-cup bag of kibble, after Luna consumed 5 cups, there will be 12 - 5 = 7 cups of kibble remaining.

Luna's master, Mary, and her husband, Frank, gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the morning and 1 cup in the evening, for a total of 2 cups given by Mary. On the same day, Frank gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening as he had given Luna in the afternoon, which is 2 cups x 2 = 4 cups. Together, Frank gave Luna a total of 1 + 4 = 5 cups of kibble. 

Lunaâ€™s master also gave Luna 2 cups of kibble in the morning and 1 cup in the evening. So, in total, Mary and Frank gave Luna 2 + 1 + 5 = 8 cups of kibble.

Initially, Mary had a bag of 12 cups of kibble. After giving Luna 8 cups of kibble, there will be 12 -8 = 4 cups of kibble remaining in the bag.

First, we calculate how much kibble Luna consumed on that day. 
Mary gave Luna 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening, so in total, Mary gave Luna 2 cups of kibble.

Frank, on the other hand, gave Luna 1 cup in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening as he had given Luna in the afternoon. Since he gave Luna 1 cup in the afternoon, he gave her 2 * 1 = 2 cups in the late evening.

So, in total, Frank gave Luna 1 cup + 2 cups = 3 cups of kibble.

Now, we know that Luna's master gave Luna 2 cups in the morning and evening, and 3 cups in the afternoon and late evening. Therefore, the total kibble given to Luna is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 cups.

The next morning when Mary checks the kibble bag, she will find 12 - 6 = 6 cups remaining.

Here's the breakdown of what Mary and Frank gave Luna for the day:

Mary gave Luna:
- 1 cup in the morning
- 1 cup in the evening
This totals 2 cups of kibble given by Mary.

Frank gave Luna:
- 1 cup in the afternoon
- Twice as much in the late evening, which is 2 cups

So, Frank gave Luna a total of 3 cups of kibble (1 + 2 = 3).

Therefore, in total, Mary and Frank gave Luna 2+3 = 5 cups of kibble.

If the bag originally contained 12 cups of kibble and Mary and Frank gave Luna 5 cups, we find out the remaining kibble in the bag:
\[
12 - 5 = 7 \text{ cups of kibble remaining}.

Frank gave Luna 1 cup in the afternoon, and twice as much in the late evening, which is 1 * 2 = 2 cups. Therefore, Frank gave Luna a total of 1 + 2 = 3 cups on that day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of kibble given by Mary and Frank on that day by summing up the amounts they each gave Luna: 2 (Mary's amount) + 3 (Frank's amount) = 5 cups. 

Initially, the bag had 12 cups of kibble. After giving Luna 5 cups, the remaining amount of kibble in the bag is 12 - 5 = 7 cups.

Luna eats a total of 1 + 1 = 2 cups of kibble a day.
Mary gives Luna 1 + 1 = 2 cups of kibble.
Frank gives Luna 1 = 1 cup again.
And then he gives Luna 2 * 1 = 2 cups of kibble in the evening.
So total, Luna has been fed 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7 cups of kibble.
Therefore, 12 - 7 = 5 cups of kibble are left in the bag.

Luna consumes 2 cups of kibble every day. Mary fed Luna 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening, so in total she gave 2 cups. On the same day, Frank gave Luna 1 cup in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening, which is 2 cups. Therefore, Frank gave a total of 1 cup + 2 cups = 3 cups.

So, the total amount of kibble given to Luna that day is 2 cups (Mary) + 3 cups (Frank) = 5 cups. Mary started with a 12-cup bag. After giving Luna 5 cups, the bag will have 12 - 5 = 7 cups remaining.
