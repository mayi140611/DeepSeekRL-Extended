To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost per DVD:**
   - Cost to make one DVD = $6

2. **Calculate the selling price per DVD:**
   - Selling price = 2.5 * Cost
   - Selling price = 2.5 * $6 = $15

3. **Calculate the profit per DVD:**
   - Profit per DVD = Selling price - Cost
   - Profit per DVD = $15 - $6 = $9

4. **Calculate the total number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks:**
   - DVDs sold per day = 500
   - DVDs sold per week = 500 * 5 = 2500
   - DVDs sold in 20 weeks = 2500 * 20 = 50,000

5. **Calculate the total profit from the DVDs sold in 20 weeks:**
   - Total profit = Profit per DVD * Total number of DVDs sold
   - Total profit = $9 * 50,000 = $450,000

6. **Calculate the profit from the movie:**
   - Cost to make the movie = $2000

7. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - Total profit = Total profit from DVDs + Cost of the movie
   - Total profit = $450,000 + $2000 = $452,000

**Answer:**
James makes a profit of $452,000 in 20 weeks.

This reasoning demonstrates how to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and apply basic arithmetic operations to find the total profit.

To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the revenue from selling 500 movies per day for 5 days:
   Revenue = 500 movies/day * 5 days/week * 2.5 = $6,250/week

2. Calculate the total cost of making 500 movies per day for 5 days:
   Cost to make = 500 movies/day * 5 days/week * $6/movie = $15,000/week

3. Calculate the actual sale price of each DVD:
   Price per DVD = 2.5 * $6 = $15

4. Calculate the actual sales for 500 movies per day for 5 days:
   Sales = 500 movies/day * 5 days/week * $15/DVD = $37,500/week

5. Subtract the cost from the sales to find the profit:
   Profit = Sales - Cost = $37,500/week - $15,000/week = $22,500/week

6. Calculate the profit for 20 weeks:
   Total profit = $22,500/week * 20 weeks = $450,000

Therefore, the total profit James makes in 20 weeks is $450,000.

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the daily profit before considering taxes and other factors. 

The cost to make each DVD is $6, and James sells it for 2.5 times that amount, which is $6 * 2.5 = $15. 

So, for each DVD sold, the profit before taxes is $15 - $6 = $9.

Next, we calculate the daily profit:
Daily profit = $9 / DVD * 500 DVDs = $4500 per day.

Then, we calculate the weekly profit:
Weekly profit = $4500 / day * 5 days = $22,500 per week.

Finally, we convert this to a weekly profit over 20 weeks:
Weekly profit (20 weeks) = $22,500 / week * 20 weeks = $450,000.

To calculate the profit James makes in 20 weeks, we need to determine his revenue and his costs.

First, let's calculate his profit per movie:
- Cost to create one DVD: $6
- Selling price per DVD: $15 (2.5 times the cost to create one DVD)

Profit per DVD = Selling price per DVD - Cost to create one DVD
Profit per DVD = $15 - $6 = $9

Next, let's calculate his total revenue in one week:
- He sells 500 movies a day and there are 5 days a week.
- Total movies in one week = 500 * 5 = 2500 movies

Revenue per week = Total movies in one week * Profit per DVD
Revenue per week = 2500 * $9 = $22,500

Now, let's calculate his total revenue in 20 weeks:
Total revenue = Revenue per week * Number of weeks
Total revenue = $22,500 * 20 = $450,000

Finally, let's calculate his total profit in 20 weeks:
Total profit = Total revenue - Cost to create movies
Cost to create movies = Number of movies created * Cost per movie
Cost to create movies = 2500 * $2000 = $5,000,000

Profit in 20 weeks = Total revenue - Cost to create movies
Profit in 20 weeks = $450,000 - $5,000,000 = -$4,550,000

This negative value indicates that James is losing money over the 20 weeks period despite his success in creating and selling the movies. The negative value represents a loss of $4,550,000.

To calculate the profit James makes, we first need to determine his total revenue, then subtract his total cost. Let's break this down:

1. **Cost of making one movie**: $2000.
2. **Cost of making one DVD**: $6.
3. **Selling price of one DVD**: $6 * 2.5 = $15.
4. **Number of movies sold per day**: 500.
5. **Number of days per week**: 5.
6. **Number of weeks**: 20.

**Total revenue calculation:**

- Selling price of one DVD: $15.
- Number of DVDs sold per week: 500 * 5 = 2500 DVDs.
- Total revenue per week: 2500 * $15 = $37,500.

**Total revenue over 20 weeks:** 
- Total revenue = $37,500 * 20 = $750,000.

**Total cost calculation:**

- Cost of making one movie: $2000.
- Total cost for all 20 weeks: 2000 * 20 = $40,000.

**Profit calculation:**

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

To calculate the profit James makes, we need to consider the components of his business, which are:

1. Cost of creating the movie.
2. Cost of making each DVD.
3. Selling price of each DVD.
4. Number of movies sold per day.
5. Number of days sold per week.
6. Number of weeks.

Let's calculate these step by step:

**Step 1: Cost of creating the movie.**

James spent $2000 on creating the movie.

**Step 2: Cost of making each DVD.**

Each DVD costs $6 to make.

**Step 3: Selling price of each DVD.**

He sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost of making it:
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2.5 \times 6 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Number of movies sold per day.**

He sells 500 movies a day.

**Step 5: Number of days sold per week.**

He sells movies 5 days a week.

**Step 6: Number of weeks.**

He sells for 20 weeks.

**Step 7: Calculate total sales in 20 weeks.**

The total number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks will be:
\[ 500 \text{ movies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 20 \text{ weeks} = 5000 \times 20 = 100000 \text{ DVDs} \]

**Step 8: Calculate revenue from each DVD.**

The revenue from each DVD sold is $15.

**Step 9: Calculate total revenue for 100000 DVDs.**

Total revenue from selling DVDs is:
\[ 100000 \text{ DVDs} \times 15 \text{ dollars/DVD} = 1500000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 10: Calculate the profit.**

Total revenue minus the total expenses:
\[ \text{Total revenue} - (\text{Total cost of creating the movie} + \text{Total cost of making DVDs}) \]

Total cost of creating the movie is $2000.

Total cost of making DVDs consists of the cost to make the movie and the cost to make 100000 DVDs:
\[ \text{Total cost of making DVDs} = 2000 + (100000 \times 6) \]
\[ \text{Total cost of making DVDs} = 2000 + 600000 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of making DVDs} = 602000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit made is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} - (\text{Total cost of creating the movie} + \text{Total cost of making DVDs}) \]
\[ 1500000 - (2000 + 602000) \]
\[ 1500000 - 622000 \]
\[ 878000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total profit James makes in 20 weeks is $878,000.

Firstly, let's calculate the cost of making each DVD. The movie costs $2000 to make, and each DVD costs $6 to make, so the total cost of materials for 500 movies is:
\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]
Next, let's find out how much James makes from selling 500 movies per day. If each DVD sells for 2.5 times the cost of materials, then the selling price for each DVD is:
\[ 2.5 \times 3000 = 7500 \text{ dollars} \]
Therefore, the profit per movie is the selling price minus the making and selling costs:
\[ 7500 - (2000 + 3000) = 7500 - 5000 = 2500 \text{ dollars per movie} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total profit from selling 500 movies per day for 5 days a week. The total number of movies sold in one week is:
\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ movies} \]
Next, we calculate the number of weeks in the 20 weeks: 
\[ 20 \text{ weeks} \]
Then the total number of movies sold in 20 weeks is:
\[ 2500 \times 20 = 50000 \text{ movies} \]
Finally, the total profit is:
\[ 2500 \times 50000 = 125000000 \text{ dollars} \]
Therefore, the profit James makes in 20 weeks is:
\[ 125000000 \text{ dollars} \]

To calculate the profit James makes in 20 weeks, we need to find out the total revenue and total cost incurred by him.

First, let's find out how many DVDs he sells in a day: 

500 movies/day * $6/dV=D/1000 = $3000/day

Then, let's find out how many DVDs he sells in a week:

$3000/day * 5 days/week = $15000/week

Finally, let's find out how many DVDs he sells in 20 weeks:

$15000/week * 20 weeks = $300000

Now, let's calculate the total cost James incurs:

$2000 (cost of movie) + ($6 * $300000) = $2000 + $1800000 = $1802000

Profit is calculated by subtracting total cost from total revenue:

$300000 - $1802000 = -$1502000.

Therefore, the answer is -$1502000. James would lose $1502000 in 20 weeks.

To calculate James's total revenue and profit, we'll break down the problem into steps:

1. **Selling Price per DVD:**
   - Selling price is 2.5 times the cost to make one DVD.
   - Cost to make one DVD = $6.
   - Selling price per DVD = $6 * 2.5 = $15.

2. **Daily Revenue:**
   - Number of movies sold per day = 500.
   - Revenue per day = Selling price * Number of movies sold = $15 * 500 = $7,500.

3. **Weekly Revenue:**
   - Days per week = 5.
   - Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Days per week = $7,500 * 5 = $37,500.

4. **Annual Revenue:**
   - Weeks per year = 20.
   - Annual revenue = Weekly revenue * Weeks per year = $37,500 * 20 = $750,000.

5. **Cost Structure:**
   - Total movie cost = $2000.
   - Total variable cost = Variable cost per DVD * Number of DVDs = $6 * 500 = $3,000 (cost per day). 
     This cost is spread over time, but for simplicity, we consider this a one-time cost.
   - Total fixed costs = Total movie cost = $2000.

6. **Total Revenue:**
   - Annual revenue = $750,000.
   - Total fixed costs = $2000.
   - Profit = Total revenue - Fixed costs = $750,000 - $2000 = $748,000.

Now, we can calculate the profit over 20 weeks:

**Profit over 20 weeks = Annual profit = $748,000.**

Therefore, the answer is \( \text{James makes a profit of } \boxed{748,000} \) over 20 weeks.

To determine the profit James makes in 20 weeks, we first need to understand the cost breakdown and the revenue from sales.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost to make one DVD.**
The cost to make one DVD is $6.

**Step 2: Determine the selling price of one DVD.**
The movie is sold for 2.5 times the cost to make it.
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2.5 \times 6 = 15 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit from one DVD.**
The profit from one DVD is the selling price minus the cost to make one DVD.
\[ \text{Profit from one DVD} = 15 - 6 = 9 \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of DVDs sold per week.**
James sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week.
\[ \text{Weekly sales} = 500 \text{ DVDs/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 2500 \text{ DVDs/week} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the weekly profit.**
The profit per week is the number of DVDs sold per week times the profit from one DVD.
\[ \text{Weekly profit} = 2500 \text{ DVDs/week} \times 9 \text{ dollars/dvd} = 22500 \text{ dollars/week} \]

**Step 6: Determine the total weekly profit for 20 weeks.**
To find the total profit for 20 weeks, we multiply the weekly profit by 20.
\[ \text{Total profit for 20 weeks} = 22500 \text{ dollars/week} \times 20 \text{ weeks} = 450000 \text{ dollars} \]

James sells each DVD for \(2.5 \times 6 = 15\) dollars. The profit per DVD is \(15 - 6 = 9\) dollars.

Since he sells 500 DVDs per day, his daily income is \(500 \times 9 = 4500\) dollars. Over 5 days a week, it is \(4500 \times 5 = 22500\) dollars.

In 20 weeks, his total income is \(22500 \times 20 = 450000\) dollars.

The total cost of producing 500 movies a day is \(500 \times 6 \times 50 \times 20 = 3000000\) dollars.

To determine the profit James makes, we need to calculate his revenue, his costs, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's find the cost to make one DVD:
\[ \text{Cost per DVD} = \$6 \]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price of one DVD:
\[ \text{Selling price per DVD} = 2.5 \times \text{Cost per DVD} = 2.5 \times \$6 = \$15 \]

Now, let's find out how many DVDs are sold per week:
\[ \text{Number of DVDs sold per day} = 500 \]
\[ \text{Number of days in a week} = 5 \]
\[ \text{Dowlae of DVDs per week} = 500 \times 5 = 2500 \]

Next, we calculate the weekly revenue from selling DVDs:
\[ \text{Weekly revenue} = \text{Selling price per DVD} \times \text{Dowlae of DVDs per week} = \$15 \times 2500 = \$37,500 \]

Now, we calculate the total weekly cost of making DVDs:
\[ \text{Cost per DVD} = \$6 \]
\[ \text{Total weekly cost} = 2500 \times 6 = \$15,000 \]

Next, we find the weekly profit by subtracting the weekly cost from the weekly revenue:
\[ \text{Weekly profit} = \text{Weekly revenue} - \text{Total weekly cost} = \$37,500 - \$15,000 = \$22,500 \]

Finally, we calculate the total profit over 20 weeks:
\[ \text{Total profit} = 20 \times \$22,500 = \$450,000 \]

Therefore, James makes a total profit of \$450,000 in 20 weeks.
