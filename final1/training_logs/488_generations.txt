To find the difference in the bookstore's earnings on "TOP" and "ABC" books sold last week, we calculate the earnings from each book and then find the difference.

First, calculate the earnings from the "TOP" books:
13 "TOP" books * $8 each = $104

Next, calculate the earnings from the "ABC" books:
4 "ABC" books * $23 each = $92

Now, find the difference in earnings:
$104 (from "TOP") - $92 (from "ABC") = $12

Therefore, the difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week is $12.

To find the difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week, we need to calculate the earnings from each book and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the "TOP" books:
- Cost of one "TOP" book: $8
- Number of "TOP" books sold: 13
- Total earnings from "TOP" books: \( 13 \times 8 = 104 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the "ABC" books:
- Cost of one "ABC" book: $23
- Number of "ABC" books sold: 4
- Total earnings from "ABC" books: \( 4 \times 23 = 92 \) dollars

Now, let's find the difference in earnings between the two books:
- Total earnings from "TOP" books: $104
- Total earnings from "ABC" books: $92
- Difference in earnings: \( 104 - 92 = 12 \) dollars

Therefore, the bookstore made a difference of $12 in earnings between these two books last week.

To find the difference in earnings, we need to calculate the total earnings from each book sold and then subtract the smaller from the larger earnings.

For "TOP":
- Cost per book: $8
- Number of books sold: 13

Earnings from "TOP":
\( 13 \times $8 = $104 \)

For "ABC":
- Cost per book: $23
- Number of books sold: 4

Earnings from "ABC":
\( 4 \times $23 = $92 \)

To find the difference in earnings:

\( $104 - $92 = $12 \)

Therefore, the difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week is $12.

To find the difference in earnings, we first calculate the weekly earnings from "TOP" books, then the earnings from "ABC" books, and finally find the difference between these two amounts.

1. The weekly earnings from the sale of "TOP" books:
\[ 13 \text{ books} \times \$8 \text{ per book} = \$104 \]
2. The weekly earnings from the sale of "ABC" books:
\[ 4 \text{ books} \times \$23 \text{ per book} = \$92 \]

Now, to find the difference in earnings, we subtract the earnings from "ABC" books from the earnings from "TOP" books:
\[ \$104 - \$92 = \$12 \]

So, the difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week is \$12.

To find the difference in the bookstore's earnings on the two books last week, we first calculate the total earnings from each book.

Total earnings from "TOP" books = 13 books * $8/book = $104

Total earnings from "ABC" books = 4 books * $23/book = $92

Now, we find the difference in earnings between the two types of books:

Difference in earnings = Total earnings from "TOP" - Total earnings from "ABC"
                       = $104 - $92

- Therefore, the total earnings from "TOP" books is \(13 \times 8 = 104\) dollars.

For "ABC" books:
- The cost price is $23.
- 4 books were sold.
- Therefore, the total earnings from "ABC" books is \(4 \times 23 = 92\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between the earnings from "TOP" and "ABC" books:
- Difference in earnings = Earnings from "TOP" - Earnings from "ABC"

To determine the difference in the bookstore's earnings on the best-selling and least-selling books last week, we can calculate the earnings for each book and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the best-selling book "TOP":

Earnings from "TOP" = Number of "TOP" books sold × Price of "TOP" book
Earnings from "TOP" = 13 books × $8/book
Earnings from "TOP" = $104

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the least-selling book "ABC":

Earnings from "ABC" = Number of "ABC" books sold × Price of "ABC" book
Earnings from "ABC" = 4 books × $23/book
Earnings from "ABC" = $92

Now, let's find the difference in the bookstore's earnings between the best-selling and least-selling books:

Difference in earnings = Earnings from "ABC" - Earnings from "TOP"
Difference in earnings = $92 - $104
Difference in earnings = -$12

Since the bookstore had a loss on "TOP" books, the difference in the earnings is -$12.

To find the difference in earnings from the best-selling book ("TOP") and the least-selling book ("ABC") last week, we first need to calculate the earnings from each book.

\( \text{Earnings from "TOP"} = \text{Number of "TOP" books sold} \times \text{Cost per "TOP" book} \)
\( \text{Earnings from "TOP"} = 13 \times 8 \)
\( \text{Earnings from "TOP"} = 104 \)

For "ABC":

\( \text{Earnings from "ABC"} = 4 \times 23 \)
\( \text{Earnings from "ABC"} = 92 \)

Now, we find the difference in earnings between the two books:
\( \text{Difference in earnings} = \text{Earnings from "TOP"} - \text{Earnings from "ABC"} \)
\( \text{Difference in earnings} = 104 - 92 \)
\( \text{Difference in earnings} = 12 \)
