###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Jackson wants to impress his girlfriend by filling her hot tub with champagne. The hot tub holds 40 gallons of liquid. Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart. (There are 4 quarts per gallon). If each bottle of champagne costs $50, but Jackson gets a 20% volume discount, how much does he spend on champagne?

system
To determine how much Jackson spends on champagne, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the hot tub capacity from gallons to quarts**:
   - 1 gallon = 4 quarts
   - For 40 gallons: 
     \[
     40 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 160 \text{ quarts}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bottles needed**:
   - Each bottle holds 1 quart.
   - For 160 quarts:
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles} = 160 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine the original cost before the discount**:
   - Each bottle costs $50.
   - The total cost without the discount:
     \[
     160 \text{ bottles} \times \$50/\text{bottle} = \$8000
     \]

4. **Calculate the discount amount**:
   - The discount is 20% off.
   - Discount amount:
     \[
     20\% \times \$8000 = 0.20 \times \$8000 = \$1600
     \]

5. **Calculate the final cost after applying the discount**:
   - Final cost:
     \[
     \$8000 - \$1600 = \$6400
     \]

Therefore, Jackson spends $6400 on champagne.

To determine how much Jackson spends on champagne, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the hot tub's capacity to quarts:**
   \[
   1 \text{ gallon} = 4 \text{ quarts}
   \]
   \[
   40 \text{ gallons} = 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of bottles Jackson needs:**
   Each bottle holds 1 quart, so:
   \[
   160 \text{ quarts} \div 1 \text{ quart per bottle} = 160 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. **Determine the original cost before the discount:**
   Each bottle costs $50, so:
   \[
   160 \text{ bottles} \times 50 \text{ dollars per bottle} = 8000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apply the 20% volume discount:**
   The discount is 20%, so:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 8000 \text{ dollars} = 0.20 \times 8000 = 1600 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted cost} = 8000 \text{ dollars} - 1600 \text{ dollars} = 6400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Jackson spends **$6400** on champagne.

First, we need to convert the volume of the hot tub from gallons to quarts. Since there are 4 quarts per gallon, for 40 gallons, we have:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 160 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, Jackson needs to determine how many bottles of champagne he needs. Since each bottle contains 1 quart, Jackson will need 160 bottles of champagne.

Each bottle costs $50, and Jackson gets a 20% discount. So, the discounted price per bottle will be:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/bottle} \times (1 - 0.20) = 50 \times 0.80 = 40 \text{ dollars/bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost Jackson needs to spend on champagne:

\[ 160 \text{ bottles} \times 40 \text{ dollars/bottle} = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

First, we need to determine the total number of quarts of champagne that will fill the hot tub. Since the hot tub holds 40 gallons and each gallon contains 4 quarts, the total volume in quarts is \(40 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 160 \text{ quarts}\).

Next, we calculate the original cost of the champagne before the discount. Since each bottle costs $50, the total cost without any discount is \(160 \text{ quarts} \times 50 \text{ dollars/bottle}\).

Jackson gets a 20% discount on his original total cost. So, the discount amount is 20% of the original total cost. The remaining amount Jackson has to pay is 80% of the original total cost.

We can now calculate these values.

First, we need to determine how many bottles of champagne Jackson needs to fill the hot tub. Since the hot tub holds 40 gallons and there are 4 quarts in a gallon, the hot tub holds 40 * 4 = 160 quarts of liquid. Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart, so Jackson needs 160 bottles of champagne.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of these bottles before the discount. Since each bottle costs $50 and he gets a 20% volume discount, we first find out the total cost without the discount and then calculate the discount amount.

The total cost without discount would be 160 * $50 = $8000. Jackson gets a 20% discount, so the discount amount is 20% of $8000, which is 0.20 * $8000 = $1600.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jackson spends on champagne. The total cost after discount is $8000 - $1600 = $6400.

To find out how much Jackson spends on champagne, we need to calculate the total volume of champagne needed for the hot tub and then determine the cost after the discount.

First, convert gallons to quarts:
- 1 gallon equals 4 quarts.
- The hot tub holds 40 gallons.

So, the quantity of champagne needed in quarts is:
$$
40 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 160 \text{ quarts}
$$

Next, calculate the discount on the total cost:
- Jackson gets a 20% volume discount.
- Therefore, he pays 80% of the total cost.

Let's calculate the total cost without discount:
$$
160 \text{ quarts} \times \$50/\text{quart} = \$8000
$$

Now, apply the 20% volume discount:
$$
160 \text{ quarts} \times \$50/\text{quart} \times (1 - 0.20) = \$8000 \times 0.80 = \$6400
$$

So, Jackson spends \$6400 on champagne after the discount.

To determine how much Jackson spends on champagne, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total volume of champagne needed in gallons.
2. Determine the number of bottles required.
3. Calculate the total cost without the discount.
4. Apply the 20% volume discount.
5. Calculate the final amount spent.

Step 1: Calculate the total volume in gallons.
The hot tub holds 40 gallons.
Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, the hot tub holds \(40 \times 4 = 160\) quarts.

Step 2: Determine the number of bottles required.
Each bottle holds 1 quart, so Jackson needs 160 bottles.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost without the discount.
Each bottle costs $50, so without the discount, the total cost is \(160 \times 50 = 8000\) dollars.

Step 4: Apply the 20% volume discount.
The discount applies to the volume of champagne, not the price per bottle. The volume of champagne in quarts is 160, and we can apply the discount to this volume. The volume of champagne each bottle can hold is 1 gallon, and each bottle costs $50, so the discount on the price is:
\[ 160 \text{ gallons} \times 20\% = 32 \text{ gallons} \]
The cost of the champagne is then:
\[ 32 \text{ gallons} \times 50 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 1600 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 5: Calculate the final amount spent.
The final amount spent after applying the discount is:
\[ 8000 \text{ dollars} - 1600 \text{ dollars} = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jackson spends $6400 on champagne.

To solve this problem, let's first determine the total volume of champagne needed in gallons.

1 quart = 0.25 gallons (since there are 4 quarts in a gallon)
40 gallons * 0.25 = 10 quarts, which is 10 gallons (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts)

Since each bottle holds 1 quart, Jackson will need 10 bottles of champagne.

If each bottle costs $50 and he gets a 20% discount, we need to calculate the discounted price per bottle first.

Discounted price per bottle = Original price per bottle * (1 - Discount rate)
= $50 * (1 - 0.20)
= $50 * 0.80
= $40

Now that we know Jackson will pay $40 for each bottle, we can calculate the total cost.

Total cost = Number of bottles * Discounted price per bottle
= 10 bottles * $40
= $400

Therefore, Jackson spends $400 on champagne.
