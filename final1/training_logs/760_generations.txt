###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

<reasoning>
Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. The dietitian ate three-fourths of her lunch. Since her lunch had 40 calories, she consumed \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40\) calories.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \ \text{calories} \]

2. The recommended calorie intake is 25 calories.

3. To find out how many more calories than the recommended amount she ate, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount she consumed:
\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \ \text{calories} \]

4. We need to confirm if there are additional details or steps missing from this reasoning. This reasoning seems to be the correct way to solve the problem based on the information provided.

<reasoning>
The dietitian ate three-fourths of the lunch, which amounts to:
\( \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \) calories.

The recommended calorie intake is 25 calories.

So, the extra calories eaten beyond the recommended amount is:
\( 30 - 25 = 5 \) calories.

Therefore, the dietitian ate 5 calories more than the recommended amount.
