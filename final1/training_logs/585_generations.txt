system
To calculate the total number of miles Harvey and Sam run together, we first need to find out how many miles Harvey runs. According to the information provided, Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam, who runs a total of 12 miles. Therefore, Harvey runs \(12 + 8 = 20\) miles.

Next, we add the miles run by Harvey and Sam to find the total distance they both run together. So, the total distance is \(12 + 20 = 32\) miles.

system
To calculate the total number of miles that Harvey and Sam run together, we first need to determine how many miles Harvey runs. We know that Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam, and Sam runs a total of 12 miles.

First, we calculate the number of miles Harvey runs:
\[ \text{Miles Harveys runs} = \text{Miles Sam runs} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles Sam runs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Miles Harveys runs} = 12 \text{ miles} + 8 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Miles Harveys runs} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the miles that Sam and Harvey run to find the total distance they both run together:
\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Miles Harveys runs} + \text{Miles Sam runs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 20 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 32 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles the two friends run together is 32 miles.

Let's calculate the total number of miles Harvey and Sam run together.

1. Sam runs 12 miles.
2. Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam, so Harvey runs \(12 + 8 = 20\) miles.

To find the total number of miles they both run together, we add Sam's distance and Harvey's distance:

\(12 + 20 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of miles Harvey and Sam run together is 32 miles.

Let's denote the distance Sam runs as \( S \) and the distance Harvey runs as \( H \).

From the problem, we know that \( S = 12 \) miles and \( H = S + 8 \) miles. Therefore, Harvey runs:

\[ H = 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

To find the total number of miles they run together, we add Sam's distance and Harvey's distance:

\[ S + H = 12 + 20 = 32 \text{ miles} \]

So, Harvey and Sam together run a total of 32 miles.

system
To calculate the total number of miles Harvey and Sam run together, we need to:

1. Determine how many miles Harvey runs. Since Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam, we add 8 to the miles Sam ran, which is 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Harvey's miles} = \text{Sam's miles} + 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Harvey's miles} = 12 + 8 = 20
   \]

2. Calculate the total miles they run together by adding Harvey's miles and Sam's miles.
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = \text{Harvey's miles} + \text{Sam's miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = 20 + 12 = 32
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Harvey and Sam run together is 32 miles.

Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam. Therefore, the number of miles Harvey runs is:

\[ H = S + 8 \]

Substituting \( S \) with 12:

\[ H = 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of miles both friends run together, we add the miles run by Harvey and Sam:

\[ Total \, miles = S + H = 12 + 20 = 32 \]

So, the total number of miles the two friends run together is 32 miles.

To calculate the total number of miles Harvey and Sam run together, we start by determining how many miles Harvey runs.

Given that Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam, and Sam runs a total of 12 miles, we calculate Harvey's distance as:
\[ \text{Harvey's distance} = \text{Sam's distance} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Harvey's distance} = 12 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Harvey's distance} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, the total distance run by both friends is the sum of Harvey's and Sam's distances:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Sam's distance} + \text{Harvey's distance} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 32 \text{ miles} \]

Let's denote the total number of miles Sam runs as \( S \). According to the problem, Sam runs 12 miles. Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam, so Harvey runs \( S + 8 \) miles.

The total number of miles the two friends run together is the sum of the miles run by Sam and Harvey. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Total miles = Miles run by Sam + Miles run by Harvey
Total miles = \( S + (S + 8) \)
Total miles = \( 12 + (12 + 8) \)
Total miles = \( 12 + 12 + 8 \)
Total miles = \( 24 + 8 \)
Total miles = \( 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of miles the two friends run together is 32 miles.

\[ H = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of miles run by both of them together, we add Sam's miles and Harvey's miles:
\[ Total\ Distance = S + H \]

To find the total number of miles that Harvey and Sam run together, we first determine how many miles each person runs individually and then sum those amounts.

1. Sam runs a total of 12 miles.
2. Since Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam, we calculate Harvey's distance as follows:
\[ \text{Harvey's distance} = \text{Sam's distance} + 8 = 12 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Harvey's distance} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

3. Now we add Sam’s distance and Harvey's distance to get the total:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Sam's distance} + \text{Harvey's distance} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 32 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Harvey and Sam together run a total of 32 miles.

To find the total number of miles Harvey and Sam run together, we start by identifying the distance Sam runs. According to the information, Sam runs a total of 12 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance Harvey runs, which is 8 miles more than what Sam runs. So, we add 8 miles to the 12 miles Sam runs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 8 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we combine the distances Harvey and Sam run:

To calculate the total number of miles that Harvey and Sam run together, we need to first determine how far Harvey runs. Since Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam, and Sam runs 12 miles, we can add 8 miles to Sam's distance to find Harvey's distance:

Sam's distance: 12 miles
Harvey's distance: 12 miles + 8 miles = 20 miles

Now, we add their distances together to find the total number of miles they run:

Total distance run by both: 12 miles (Sam) + 20 miles (Harvey) = 32 miles
