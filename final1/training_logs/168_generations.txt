The orders include 2 * $15.00 + 6 * $3.00 + 6 * $2.00 = $30.00 + $18.00 + $12.00 = $60.00
$60.00 * 10/100 = $6.00 discount

The total without the discount is $60.00 - $6.00 = $54.00

The final order fee is $54.00 + $6.00 = $60.00

The 6 croissants cost 6 * $3.00 = $18.00
The 6 biscuits cost 6 * $2.00 = $12.00
The quiches, croissants and biscuits cost $15.00 + $18.00 + $12.00 = $45.00
The $45.00 cost qualifies for the discount, so the discount is 0.10 * $45.00 = $4.50
The total cost is $45.00 - $4.50 = $40.50
The answer is 40.5.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 2 quiches for $15.00 each:
  2 quiches × $15.00 = $30.00

- 6 croissants at $3.00 each:
  6 croissants × $3.00 = $18.00

- 6 buttermilk biscuits for $2.00 each:
  6 biscuits × $2.00 = $12.00

Now, let's add up these costs to get the total order before the discount:
$30.00 (quiches) + $18.00 (croissants) + $12.00 (biscuits) = $60.00

Since the order costs over $50.00 and the discount is offered for orders over $50.00, Silvia gets the 10% discount.

Now, let's calculate the total discount:
10% of $60.00 = 0.10 × $60.00 = $6.00

Finally, subtract the discount from the total order to get the final price:
$60.00 - $6.00 = $54.00

The final price of Silvia's order after the discount is $54.00.

The total cost of 2 quiches is $15.00 x 2 = $30.00.
The total cost of 6 croissants is $3.00 x 6 = $18.00.
The total cost of 6 buttermilk biscuits is $2.00 x 6 = $12.00.
Therefore, the total order amount is $120.00.
The discount is 10% of $120.00, so the discount amount is $120.00 x 10/100 = $12.00.
Her order will be $120.00 - $12.00 = $108.00.

Silvia orders 2 quiches for $15.00 each, so the total cost for the quiches is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
She also orders 6 croissants for $3.00 each, so the total cost for the croissants is 6 * $3.00 = $18.00.
Finally, she orders 6 buttermilk biscuits for $2.00 each, so the total cost for the biscuits is 6 * $2.00 = $12.00.
The total cost for her order before the discount is $30.00 + $18.00 + $12.00 = $60.00.
Since her order is over $50.00, she is eligible for the 10% discount. So, the discount amount is 10% of $60.00, which is 0.10 * $60.00 = $6.00.
Therefore, the total cost for her order with the discount is $60.00 - $6.00 = $54.00.
