First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream sundaes. Alicia's sundae costs $7.50, Brant's sundae costs $10.00, Josh's sundae costs $8.50, and Yvette's sundae costs $9.00. Adding these amounts together gives us the subtotal.

\[
7.50 + 10.00 + 8.50 + 9.00 = 35.00
\]

Next, we calculate the tip, which is 20% of the total meal cost. To find the tip, we multiply the subtotal by 20% (or 0.20):

\[
35.00 \times 0.20 = 7.00
\]

Now, we add the tip to the subtotal to get the total bill:

\[
35.00 + 7.00 = 42.00
\]

So, Yvette's total bill including the tip is $42.00.

To calculate the final bill, first, we need to determine the total cost of the sundaes without the tip. 

- Alicia's peanut butter sundae: $7.50
- Brant's Royal banana split sundae: $10.00
- Josh's death by chocolate sundae: $8.50
- Yvette's cherry jubilee sundae: $9.00

Adding these amounts gives:
$$ 7.50 + 10.00 + 8.50 + 9.00 = 35.00 $$

This total is the cost of the sundaes before the tip.

Now, we need to calculate the tip, which is 20% of the total cost of the sundaes:
\[
\text{Tip} = 0.20 \times 35.00 = 7.00
\]

The final bill, including the tip, is the total cost of the sundaes plus the tip:
\[
\text{Final Bill} = 35.00 + 7.00 = 42.00
\]

Therefore, the final bill is $42.00.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream sundaes ordered by Yvette and her friends. The cost of Alicia's sundae is $7.50, Brant's sundae costs $10.00, Josh's sundae costs $8.50, and Yvette's sundae costs $9.00. Summing these amounts will give us the total cost of the sundaes.

The total cost of the sundaes is:
\[ \$7.50 + \$10.00 + \$8.50 + \$9.00 \]

Next, we calculate the tip Yvette leaves for her waiter, which is 20% of the total cost of the sundaes. We multiply the total cost by 0.20 to find the tip amount.

Lastly, we add the total cost of the sundaes and the tip to find the final bill.

<answer>
\[ \text{Total Cost of Sundaes} = \$7.50 + \$10.00 + \$8.50 + \$9.00 = \$35.00 \]

\[
\text{Tip} = \$35.00 \times 0.20 = \$7.00
\]

\[
\text{Final Bill} = \$35.00 + \$7.00 = \$42.00

The final bill for the ice cream sundaes is $42.00.

To calculate Yvette's final bill, we first need to find the total cost of her ice cream sundaes. Let's start by adding the costs of each sundae:

Alicia: $7.50
Brant: $10.00
Josh: $8.50
Yvette: $9.00

$7.50 + $10.00 + $8.50 + $9.00 = $35.00

Now, we need to calculate 20% tip from the total cost of $35.00:

20% of $35.00 = 0.20 * $35.00 = $7.00

Next, we add the tip to the total cost to find the final bill:

Total bill = Total cost + Tip
Total bill = $35.00 + $7.00 = $42.00

So, Yvette's final bill is $42.00.

To determine the final bill, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the three friends' orders.
2. Add Yvette's order to the total.
3. Calculate the tip based on the total bill.
4. Add the tip to the total bill to get the final amount.

Let's break down each step:

1. Calculate the total cost of the three friends' orders:
Alicia's order: $7.50
Brant's order: $10.00
Josh's order: $8.50
Yvette's order: $9.00

Adding these together: 
$7.50 + $10.00 + $8.50 + $9.00 = $35.00

2. Add Yvette's order to the total:
$35.00 (friends' orders) + $9.00 (Yvette's order) = $44.00

3. Calculate the tip:
The tip is 20% of the total bill. Since the total bill is $44.00, the tip amount is:
0.20 * $44.00 = $8.80

4. Add the tip to the total bill:
$44.00 (total bill) + $8.80 (tip) = $52.80

Therefore, the final bill will be $52.80.

To determine the final bill, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream sundaes without the tip. We add the individual prices of the sundaes:

- Alicia's peanut butter sundae: $7.50
- Brant's Royal banana split sundae: $10.00
- Josh's death by chocolate sundae: $8.50
- Yvette's cherry jubilee sundae: $9.00

Total without tip = $7.50 + $10.00 + $8.50 + $9.00 = $35.00

Next, we calculate the tip based on the 20% tip rate applied to the total amount:

Tip = 20% of $35.00 = 0.20 * $35.00 = $7.00

Now we add the tip to the total amount without the tip to find the final bill:

Final bill = Total without tip + Tip = $35.00 + $7.00 = $42.00

To determine the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the ice cream sundaes without considering the tip.

Alicia's sundae costs $7.50.
Brant's sundae costs $10.00.
Josh's sundae costs $8.50.
Yvette's sundae costs $9.00.

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 10.00 + 8.50 + 9.00 = 35.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the tip. The tip rate is 20%, so the tip amount is:

Adding the tip to the cost of the sundaes gives the final bill:

So, the total cost of the sundaes with the tip is \( 35.00 + 7.00 = 42.00 \).

To calculate the final bill, we first need to add up the cost of all the sundaes ordered by Yvette and her friends:

- Alicia's sundae: $7.50
- Brant's Royal banana split sundae: $10.00
- Josh's death by chocolate sundae: $8.50
- Yvette's cherry jubilee sundae: $9.00

Total cost before tip = $7.50 + $10.00 + $8.50 + $9.00 = $35.00

Next, we calculate the tip which is 20% of the total cost:

Tip = 20% of $35.00 = 0.20 * $35.00 = $7.00

Finally, to get the final bill, we add the total cost of the sundaes to the tip:

Final bill = Total cost before tip + Tip = $35.00 + $7.00 = $42.00

The final tip amount is 20% of the total cost of the sundae, which is $35.00, so it equals to $7.00. Adding this to the total cost brings the final bill amount to $35.00 + $7.00 = $42.00.

It seems there was a mistake in the previous calculation. The total cost of the sundaes is actually $35.00, not $35.50. Adding the tip also gives a final bill of $42.00, not $42.50 as mentioned in the answer. Let me correct this:

Here is the corrected calculation:

1. Total cost of sundaes:
   - Alicia: $7.50
   - Brant: $10.00
   - Josh: $8.50
   - Yvette: $9.00

   Total = $7.50 + $10.00 + $8.50 + $9.00 = $35.00

2. Tip:
   Tip = 20% of $35.00 = 0.20 * $35.00 = $7.00

3. Final bill:
   Final bill = Total cost + Tip = $35.00 + $7.00 = $42.00

Therefore, the correct final bill is $42.00.
