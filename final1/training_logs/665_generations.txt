system
Reasoning:

1. Bella has twice as many marbles as frisbees, and she has 60 marbles in total.
   - So, if she has 60 marbles, she has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) frisbees.

2. Bella has 20 more frisbees than deck cards.
   - Therefore, she has \( 30 - 20 = 10 \) deck cards.

3. Bella buys \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more marbles, frisbees, and deck cards.
   - New number of marbles = \( 60 + \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 60 + 24 = 84 \) marbles.
   - New number of frisbees = \( 30 + \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 30 + 12 = 42 \) frisbees.
   - New number of deck cards = \( 10 + \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 10 + 4 = 14 \) deck cards.

4. Total number of items she would have:
   - Marbles: \( 84 + 60 = 144 \)
   - Frisbees: \( 42 + 30 = 72 \)
   - Deck cards: \( 14 + 10 = 24 \)

5. Total items: \( 144 + 72 + 24 = 240 \)

To determine how many marbles Bella has, we start with the information that she currently has 60 marbles. According to the problem, she has two times as many marbles as frisbees. Let's denote the number of frisbees as \( f \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 2f = 60 \]
\[ f = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ f = 30 \]

So, Bella has 30 frisbees. The problem also states that she has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. Let's denote the number of deck cards as \( d \). Therefore, we have:

\[ f = d + 20 \]
\[ 30 = d + 20 \]
\[ d = 30 - 20 \]
\[ d = 10 \]

So, Bella has 10 deck cards. To find the total number of items Bella currently has, we add up the number of marbles, frisbees, and deck cards:

\[ 60 + 30 + 10 = 100 \]

Now, if Bella buys \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more of each item, we need to calculate how much she buys for each item. Since she currently has 60 marbles, \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \) more marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles she will have is:

\[ 60 + 24 = 84 \]

Similarly, since she currently has 30 frisbees, \( \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12 \) more frisbees. Therefore, the total number of frisbees she will have is:

\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \]

And since she currently has 10 deck cards, \( \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \) more deck cards. Therefore, the total number of deck cards she will have is:

\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \]

Adding these together, the total number of items Bella will have is:

\[ 84 + 42 + 14 = 140 \]

Thus, the total number of items Bella will have is:

Let's denote the number of frisbees Bella has as \( F \). According to the problem, she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, so the number of marbles \( M \) is \( 2F \). Additionally, she has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, so if \( D \) is the number of deck cards, she has \( F = D + 20 \).

We are told that Bella currently has 60 marbles, so \( M = 60 \). This means \( 2F = 60 \), so \( F = 30 \).

Since she has 30 frisbees and \( F = D + 20 \), we can find the number of deck cards \( D \) by solving \( 30 = D + 20 \), which gives \( D = 10 \).

Now, if she buys \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more of each item, the number of each item will increase by \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the original amount.

For marbles: \( 60 + \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 60 + 24 = 84 \).
For frisbees: \( 30 + \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 30 + 12 = 42 \).
For deck cards: \( 10 + \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 10 + 4 = 14 \).

The total number of items is the sum of the marbles, frisbees, and deck cards: \( 84 + 42 + 14 = 140 \).

Let's denote the number of frisbees Bella has as \( F \) and the number of marbles as \( M \). We know that Bella has 60 marbles, so \( M = 60 \).

Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees, so:
\[ M = 2F \]

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Marbles to Frisbees**: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees.
   \[
   \text{Marbles} = 2 \times \text{Frisbees}
   \]
   Since Bella has 60 marbles:
   \[
   60 = 2 \times \text{Frisbees}
   \]
   Solving for frisbees:
   \[
   \text{Frisbees} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

2. **Frisbees to Deck Cards**: Bella has 20 more frisbees than deck cards.
   \[
   \text{Frisbees} = \text{Deck Cards} + 20
   \]
   Substituting the number of frisbees we found:
   \[
   30 = \text{Deck Cards} + 20
   \]
   Solving for deck cards:
   \[
   \text{Deck Cards} = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

3. **Total Current Number of Items**: Now we know the current quantities of each item:
   - Marbles: 60
   - Frisbees: 30
   - Deck Cards: 10

4. **Buying More Items**: Bella buys \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more of each item.
   - For marbles:
     \[
     \text{New Marbles} = 60 + \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 60 + 24 = 84
     \]
   - For frisbees:
     \[
     \text{New Frisbees} = 30 + \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 30 + 12 = 42
     \]
   - For deck cards:
     \[
     \text{New Deck Cards} = 10 + \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 10 + 4 = 14
     \]

5. **Total New Number of Items**: Adding up all the new quantities:
   \[
   \text{Total New Marbles} = 84
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total New Frisbees} = 42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total New Deck Cards} = 14
   \]

6. **Sum of New Quantities**: To find the total number of the items she will have:
   \[
   \text{Total New Items} = \text{New Marbles} + \text{New Frisbees} + \text{New Deck Cards} = 84 + 42 + 14 = 140

To determine the current number of each type of item Bella has, we start with the information given for marbles. Bella has 60 marbles.

From the problem, we know that:
1. Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees.
2. Bella has 20 more frisbees than deck cards.

First, let's find out the number of frisbees Bella has. Let \( F \) be the number of frisbees. According to the problem, \( 2F = 60 \). Solving for \( F \):
\[
F = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]
So, Bella has 30 frisbees.

Next, let's find out the number of deck cards. Let \( D \) be the number of deck cards. According to the problem, \( F = D + 20 \). Substituting \( F = 30 \):
\[
30 = D + 20
\]
Solving for \( D \):
\[
D = 30 - 20 = 10
\]
So, Bella has 10 deck cards.

Now, we need to determine what happens if Bella buys \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more of each item. This means she buys \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \) more marbles, \( \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12 \) more frisbees, and \( \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \) more deck cards.

The total number of each item after buying more will be:
- Marbles: \( 60 + 24 = 84 \)
- Frisbees: \( 30 + 12 = 42 \)
- Deck cards: \( 10 + 4 = 14 \)

The total number of items Bella will have is:
\[
84 + 42 + 14 = 140
\]

Therefore, the total number of items Bella will have if she buys \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more of each item is \(\boxed{140}\).

To determine the total number of items Bella will have after buying more, we first need to find out how many frisbees and deck cards she currently has.

Given that Bella has 60 marbles and has two times as many marbles as frisbees, we can determine the current number of frisbees:
\[ \text{Number of frisbees} = \frac{\text{Number of marbles}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Since Bella has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, we can determine the number of deck cards:
\[ \text{Number of deck cards} = \text{Number of frisbees} - 20 = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Now, we need to calculate how many more of each item Bella will buy. She buys \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more of each item. For marbles, she will buy:
\[ \text{Additional marbles} = 60 \times \frac{2}{5} = 24 \]
So, the total number of marbles Bella will have is:
\[ \text{Total marbles} = 60 + 24 = 84 \]

For frisbees, she will buy:
\[ \text{Additional frisbees} = 30 \times \frac{2}{5} = 12 \]
So, the total number of frisbees she will have is:
\[ \text{Total frisbees} = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

For deck cards, she will buy:
\[ \text{Additional deck cards} = 10 \times \frac{2}{5} = 4 \]
So, the total number of deck cards she will have is:
\[ \text{Total deck cards} = 10 + 4 = 14 \]

Finally, we add up all the items to find the total number of items Bella will have:
\[ \text{Total items} = 84 + 42 + 14 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of the items she will have is 140.

Let's denote the number of frisbees Bella has as \( F \) and the number of marbles as \( M \). According to the problem, Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees, which gives us the equation:
\[ M = 2F \]

Additionally, Bella has 20 more frisbees than decks, which we can write as:
\[ F = D + 20 \]
where \( D \) represents the number of decks. Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = F - 20 \]

We know Bella currently has 60 marbles, so:
\[ M = 60 \]

Substituting the value of \( M \) into the first equation:
\[ 60 = 2F \]
\[ F = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ F = 30 \]

Now we know Bella has 30 frisbees. Using the value of \( F \) in the second equation:
\[ D = F - 20 \]
\[ D = 30 - 20 \]
\[ D = 10 \]

So Bella currently has 30 frisbees and 10 decks. 
If Bella buys \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more of each item, she will have:
\[ M_{new} = M + \frac{2}{5}M \]
\[ F_{new} = F + \frac{2}{5}F \]
\[ D_{new} = D + \frac{2}{5}D \]

Substituting the current numbers:
\[ M_{new} = 60 + \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 60 + 24 = 84 \]
\[ F_{new} = 30 + \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]
\[ D_{new} = 10 + \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 10 + 4 = 14 \]

The total number of items she will have:
\[ Total = M_{new} + F_{new} + D_{new} \]
\[ Total = 84 + 42 + 14 \]
\[ Total = 138 \]

Therefore, the total number of items Bella will have after buying \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more of each item is 138.

Let's denote the number of frisbees Bella currently has as \( F \) and the number of marbles as \( M \).
According to the information, \( M = 60 \) and \( M = 2 \times F \). We can solve for \( F \) from the equation \( M = 2 \times F \).

\( 60 = 2 \times F \)
\( F = 30 \)

Now, we know she has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. So the number of deck cards \( D \) can be calculated as \( F - 20 \). Using \( F = 30 \):

\( D = 30 - 20 = 10 \)

If Bella buys \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more of each item, the number of items she will have after buying more will be:

- New number of marbles \( M' = M + \frac{2}{5}M = \frac{7}{5}M \)
- New number of frisbees \( F' = F + \frac{2}{5}F = \frac{7}{5}F \)
- New number of deck cards \( D' = D + \frac{2}{5}D = \frac{7}{5}D \)

Substitute the known values of \( F \) and \( D \):

- New number of marbles \( M' = \frac{7}{5} \times 60 \)
- New number of frisbees \( F' = \frac{7}{5} \times 30 \)
- New number of deck cards \( D' = \frac{7}{5} \times 10 \)

So the new total number of items is \( M' + F' + D' \).

Now, let's calculate the values:
\( M' = \frac{7}{5} \times 60 = 84 \)
\( F' = \frac{7}{5} \times 30 = 42 \)
\( D' = \frac{7}{5} \times 10 = 14 \)

Total number of items after buying more:
\( M' + F' + D' = 84 + 42 + 14 = 140 \)

Now, let's add this to her current total:
Total items after buying more and adding the original items:
\( 60 + 140 = 200 \)

So, the total number of items Bella will have after buying more is 200.

Bella currently has 60 marbles. Since she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards.

Let's assume Bella has \( x \) deck cards. Then:
\[ 30 = x + 20 \]
\[ x = 30 - 20 = 10 \]
So, Bella currently has 10 deck cards.

If Bella buys \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more of each item, the number of items will increase by \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the number of each item she currently has.

\]

Next, since she has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, the number of deck cards is:

\[
\text{Number of deck cards} = 30 - 20 = 10

Now, let's calculate the number of each item after she buys 2/5 times more of each item. For marbles, she buys:

\[
\text{Additional marbles} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24

Let's denote the number of frisbees Bella has as \( F \) and the number of marbles as \( M \).

From the information given, we know that:
1. Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees:
\[ M = 2F \]
2. She has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, denoted by \( D \):
\[ F = D + 20 \]

We are also told that Bella currently has 60 marbles, so:
\[ M = 60 \]

From the first equation, we can substitute \( M \) with 60:
\[ 60 = 2F \]
\[ F = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now we can find the number of frisbees Bella has:
\[ F = D + 20 \]
\[ F = 30 \]
\[ 30 = D + 20 \]
\[ D = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, Bella has 30 frisbees, 60 marbles, and 10 deck cards.

Next, if she buys 2/5 times more of each item, the total number of each item will be increased:
- The number of marbles increases to \( 60 + 2/5 \times 60 = 60 + 24 = 84 \)

Let's denote the number of frisbees Bella currently has as \( F \).

We know:
1. Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees, so the number of marbles \( M \) is \( M = 2F \).
2. She has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, so the number of deck cards \( C \) is \( C = F - 20 \).
3. Bella currently has 60 marbles, so \( M = 60 \).

Using the first equation, we can find the current number of frisbees:
\[ 60 = 2F \]
\[ F = 30 \]

So, Bella currently has 30 frisbees.

Now, let's determine the current number of deck cards:
\[ C = F - 20 = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Thus, Bella currently has 10 deck cards.

Next, we calculate how many items Bella will buy if she buys \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more of each item:
- Marbles: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \) more marbles, so \( 60 + 24 = 84 \) marbles.
- Frisbees: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12 \) more frisbees, so \( 30 + 12 = 42 \) frisbees.
- Deck cards: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \) more deck cards, so \( 10 + 4 = 14 \) deck cards.

Now, we sum up the items she will have:
- Marbles: \( 60 + 24 = 84 \)
- Frisbees: \( 30 + 12 = 42 \)
- Deck cards: \( 10 + 4 = 14 \)

Total number of items:
\[ 84 + 42 + 14 = 140 \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial number of frisbees Bella has.
2. Determine the initial number of deck cards Bella has.
3. Calculate the number of each item she will buy if she buys 2/5 times more of each item.
4. Sum the final number of each item to find the total.

Starting with the given information:

Bella has 60 marbles. Since she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, we can calculate the initial number of frisbees:

\[ \text{Number of frisbees} = \frac{\text{Number of marbles}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we know that she has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. Therefore, the number of deck cards is:

\[ \text{Number of deck cards} = \text{Number of frisbees} - 20 = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Now, Bella buys 2/5 times more of each item. To find the final number of each item, we calculate:

- Final number of marbles: \(60 \times \frac{2}{5} = 24\)
- Final number of frisbees: \(30 \times \frac{2}{5} = 12\)
- Final number of deck cards: \(10 \times \frac{2}{5} = 4\)

To find the total number of items she will have, we sum the final numbers:

\[ \text{Total number of items} = \text{Final number of marbles} + \text{Final number of frisbees} + \text{Final number of deck cards} \]
\[ = 24 + 12 + 4 = 40 \]

So, the total number of items she will have after buying 2/5 times more of each item is 40.

Bella currently has 60 marbles. Since she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, the number of frisbees is $60 / 2 = 30$. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, so the number of deck cards is $30 - 20 = 10$.

If she buys $\frac{2}{5}$ times more of each item, she will buy an additional $\frac{2}{5} \times \text{current quantity}$.

For marbles: $\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24$, so she will have $60 + 24 = 84$ marbles.

For frisbees: $\frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12$, so she will have $30 + 12 = 42$ frisbees.

For deck cards: $\frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4$, so she will have $10 + 4 = 14$ deck cards.

The total number of items she will have is $84 + 42 + 14 = 140$.
