system
To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we need to calculate the total number of leaves that fell over the three hours and then divide by the number of hours.

In the first hour, 7 leaves fell.

In the second and third hour, 4 leaves fell each hour.

The total number of leaves that fell in the second and third hour is \(4 + 4 = 8\) leaves.

The total number of leaves that fell over the three hours is \(7 + 8 = 15\) leaves.

To find the average, we divide the total number of leaves by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{15 \text{ leaves}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 5 \text{ leaves per hour}
\]

To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we first need to determine the total number of leaves that fell over the three hours and then divide that by the number of hours.

First, we count the number of leaves that fell in each hour:
- In the first hour, 7 leaves fell.
- In the second hour, 4 leaves fell.
- In the third hour, 4 leaves fell.

Adding these together gives the total number of leaves that fell:
\[ 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 \]

Next, we divide the total number of leaves by the number of hours to find the average:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

So, the average number of leaves that fell per hour is 5.

To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of leaves that fell and then divide that by the total number of hours.

In the first hour, 7 leaves fall. In the second and third hours, 4 leaves fall per hour. So, for the second and third hours combined, we have 4 leaves/hour * 2 hours = 8 leaves.

Now, we add the leaves from the first hour to the leaves from the next two hours:

7 leaves + 4 leaves + 4 leaves = 15 leaves

There are a total of 2 hours (one first hour and two second/third hours).

To find the average, we divide the total number of leaves by the total number of hours:

15 leaves / 2 hours = 7.5 leaves/hour

So, the average number of leaves that fell per hour is 7.5.

To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we first calculate the total number of leaves that fell over the three hours and then divide by the number of hours.

1. In the first hour, 7 leaves fell.
2. For the second and third hours, 4 leaves fell each hour. So, in total, in the second and third hours, \(4 + 4 = 8\) leaves fell.

Now, we calculate the total number of leaves that fell over the three hours: \(7 + 8 = 15\) leaves.

Finally, we find the average number of leaves that fell per hour by dividing the total number of leaves by the number of hours, which is \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

Therefore, the average number of leaves that fell per hour is 5.

To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we need to calculate the total number of leaves that fell during the three hours and then divide by the number of hours.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the first hour, 7 leaves fell.
2. In the second hour, 4 leaves fell.
3. In the third hour, 4 leaves fell (since it's specified that the rate is the same for the second and third hour).

The total number of leaves that fell in three hours is:
\[ 7 (first hour) + 4 (second hour) + 4 (third hour) = 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 \]

There are 3 hours, so we need to find the average number of leaves that fell per hour by dividing the total number of leaves by the number of hours:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ leaves}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 5 \text{ leaves/hour} \]

So, the average number of leaves that fell per hour is 5.

To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we first need to determine the total number of leaves that fell over the three-hour period. 

In the first hour, 7 leaves fell. In the second and third hours, 4 leaves fell per hour. 

So, the total number of leaves that fell in 3 hours is:
\[ 7 \text{ (first hour)} + 4 \text{ (second hour)} + 4 \text{ (third hour)} = 15 \text{ leaves} \]

Next, we find the average by dividing the total number of leaves by the total number of hours:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{15 \text{ leaves}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 5 \text{ leaves per hour} \]

Therefore, the average number of leaves that fell per hour is 5.

To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of leaves that fell over the three hours and then divide this by the total number of hours (which is 3 in this case).

For the first hour, 7 leaves fell.

For the second and third hour, the leaves fell at a rate of 4 per hour, so for the second hour and third hour combined, 4 leaves per hour * 2 hours = 8 leaves.

So, the total number of leaves that fell over the three hours is 7 (first hour) + 8 (second and third hours) = 15 leaves.

The average number of leaves per hour is the total number of leaves divided by the number of hours, which is 15 leaves / 3 hours = 5 leaves per hour.

To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we need to calculate the total number of leaves that fell over the three hours and then divide by the number of hours.

First, we sum the number of leaves that fell in each hour:
- In the first hour, 7 leaves fell.
- In the second hour, 4 leaves fell.
- In the third hour, 4 leaves fell.

So, the total number of leaves that fell is:
\[ 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 \]

Next, we divide the total number of leaves by the number of hours to find the average number of leaves per hour:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

Therefore, the average number of leaves that fell per hour is \(5\).

For the first hour, 7 leaves fell.
For the second hour, 4 leaves fell.
For the third hour, 4 leaves fell.

Total number of leaves that fell = 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 leaves.

Now, we divide the total number of leaves by the total number of hours to find the average.

Average number of leaves per hour = Total number of leaves / Total number of hours
Average number of leaves per hour = 15 / 3 = 5.

So, the average number of leaves that fell per hour is 5.
