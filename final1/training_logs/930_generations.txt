<reasoning>
To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many turtles Marion received. The problem states that Martha received 40 turtles and Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate the number of turtles Marion received as follows:

Marion's turtles = Martha's turtles + 20
Marion's turtles = 40 + 20
Marion's turtles = 60

Now, to find out how many turtles they received together, we add the number of turtles received by both Marion and Martha:

Total turtles = Martha's turtles + Marion's turtles
Total turtles = 40 + 60
Total turtles = 100

So, together they received 100 turtles.

Let's denote the number of turtles Martha received as \( M \) and the number of turtles Marion received as \( N \).

According to the problem, Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha. So we can write this relationship as:
\[ N = M + 20 \]

We are also given that Martha received 40 turtles:
\[ M = 40 \]

Now we can substitute the value of \( M \) into the equation for \( N \):
\[ N = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

So, Marion received 60 turtles.

To find out how many turtles they received together, we add the number of turtles Martha and Marion received:
\[ M + N = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, Marion and Martha received 100 turtles together.

Let's denote the number of turtles Marie initially got as \( x \). Given that she received 20 more turtles than Marie, we can express her total number of turtles as \( x + 20 \). According to the problem, Marie got 40 turtles. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 40 - 20 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Marie got 20 turtles initially. If she received 20 more turtles than Martha, then Martha must have received:

\[ 20 - 20 = 0 \]

Thus, they received 20 turtles from the beginning, plus 40 turtles from Martha, which totals:

\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, they received 60 turtles together.

To find out how many turtles Marion and Martha received together, we first need to figure out how many turtles Marion received. Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha, who received 40 turtles. So, Marion received \(40 + 20 = 60\) turtles.

Now, we can add the number of turtles that both Marion and Martha received together:

Martha's turtles + Marion's turtles = \(40 + 60 = 100\) turtles.

Therefore, the total number of turtles they received together is 100.

To find out how many turtles Marion and Martha received together, we first need to determine how many turtles Marion received. According to the information given, Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha. Martha received 40 turtles, so Marion received \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) turtles.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of turtles they received together. Martha received 40 turtles and Marion received 60 turtles, so the total is \( 40 + 60 = 100 \).

Therefore, Marion and Martha received 100 turtles together.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of turtles Martha received as \( M \) and the number of turtles Marion received as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
\( M = 40 \) (since Martha received 40 turtles)

\( R = M + 20 \) (since Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha)

Substituting the value of \( M \) into the equation for \( R \):
\( R = 40 + 20 \)
\( R = 60 \)

Now, to find the total number of turtles they received together, we add \( M \) and \( R \):
\( Total = M + R \)
\( Total = 40 + 60 \)
\( Total = 100 \)

Therefore, they received 100 turtles together.

To find out how many turtles Marion and Martha received together, we need to first determine how many turtles Marion received.

We know that Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha. Since Martha received 40 turtles, we can calculate the number of turtles Marion received by adding 20 to Martha's count:
Marion's turtles = Martha's turtles + 20
Marion's turtles = 40 + 20 = 60

Now, to find the total number of turtles they received together, we add the number of turtles Martha received to the number of turtles Marion received:
Total turtles = Marion's turtles + Martha's turtles
Total turtles = 60 + 40 = 100

Therefore, Marion and Martha received a total of 100 turtles together.

Let's denote the number of turtles Martha received as \( M \). According to the problem, Martha received 40 turtles, so \( M = 40 \).

Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha. Therefore, the number of turtles Marion received, denoted as \( M_{Marion} \), can be calculated as:
\[ M_{Marion} = M + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

To find the total number of turtles they received together, we add the number of turtles Martha received to the number of turtles Marion received:
\[ Total = M + M_{Marion} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Thus, they received a total of 100 turtles.

Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha, so we can express the number of turtles Marion received as:
\[ P = M + 20 \]
\[ P = 40 + 20 \]
\[ P = 60 \]

Now, to find the total number of turtles they received together, we add the number of turtles Martha and Marion received:

Let's denote the number of turtles Martha received as \( M \) and the number of turtles Marion received as \( P \).

According to the information given, we know:
\[ P = M + 20 \]
where \( P \) represents Marion's turtles and \( M \) represents Martha's turtles.

Substituting the value of \( M \) from the information given (which is 40):
\[ P = 40 + 20 \]
\[ P = 60 \]

So, Marion received 60 turtles.

Now, to find the total number of turtles they received together:
\[ \text{Total Turtles} = M + P \]
\[ \text{Total Turtles} = 40 + 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of turtles they received together is \( 100 \).
