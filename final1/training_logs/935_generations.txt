To determine how many students do not play either basketball or volleyball, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's identify the number of students playing each sport:
- Half of the 20 students, which is 20 / 2 = 10 students, play basketball.
- Two-fifths of the 20 students, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 students, play volleyball.
- One-tenth of the 20 students, which is (1/10) * 20 = 2 students, play both basketball and volleyball.

The number of students playing either basketball or volleyball or both can be calculated by adding the number of basketball players and volleyball players, and then subtracting the number of students who play both (to avoid double-counting):
10 (basketball) + 8 (volleyball) - 2 (both) = 16 students.

Therefore, the number of students who do not play either sport is:
20 (total students) - 16 (play either sport) = 4 students.

So, 4 students in the class do not play either basketball or volleyball.

To determine how many students do not play either basketball or volleyball, we need to calculate the number of students who play each sport and then subtract from the total number of students in the class.

1. **Students who play basketball:**
   - Half of the 20 students play basketball.
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) students play basketball.

2. **Students who play volleyball:**
   - Two-fifths of the 20 students play volleyball.
   - \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) students play volleyball.

3. **Students who play both basketball and volleyball:**
   - One-tenth of the 20 students play both games.
   - \( \frac{1}{10} \times 20 = 2 \) students play both games.

4. **Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of students who play either basketball or volleyball:**
   - Total students who play either sport: 
     \[
     10 \text{ (basketball only)} + 8 \text{ (volleyball only)} + 2 \text{ (both)} = 20 \text{ students}
     \]

5. **Calculating the number of students who do not play either game:**
   - Total students in the class: 20.
   - Students who play either basketball or volleyball: 20.
   - Students who do not play either: 
     \[
     20 - 20 = 0
     \]

However, considering that the problem does not specify that all students play at least one sport, we should also consider if students who play both sports could be included in only the basketball or volleyball groups (if they would play both games).

If we assume the overlap is minimal (considering the problem does not specify otherwise), the calculation is simplified since the 10 basketball players do not overlap with the 8 volleyball players:
- Therefore, the number of students who do not play any game is 0.

Thus, only if there is significant overlap between the basketball and volleyball players are further calculations necessary.

First, let's calculate the number of students who play basketball:

\]

Next, let's calculate the number of students who play volleyball:
\[
\text{Number of volleyball players} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of students who play either basketball or volleyball is:
\[
\text{Number of students who play basketball or volleyball} = 10 + 8 - \text{Number of students who play both} = 10 + 8 - 4 = 14
\]

Thus, the number of students who do not play either game is:
\[
20 - 14 = 6

Therefore, it is true that 6 students in this class do not play either basketball or volleyball.

To determine how many students do not play either basketball or volleyball, we can start by calculating the number of students who play basketball and those who play volleyball. Then, we subtract the students who play both games from the totals for basketball and volleyball.

1. Number of students who play basketball:
   \[
   \text{Students who play basketball} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

2. Number of students who play volleyball:
   \[
   \text{Students who play volleyball} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
   \]

3. Number of students who play both basketball and volleyball:
   \[
   \text{Students who play both} = \frac{1}{10} \times 20 = 2
   \]

Next, we subtract the students who play both games from the total number of students who play basketball and volleyball to find the number of students who play only one of the games:
   \[
   \text{Students who play only basketball} = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Students who play only volleyball} = 8 - 2 = 6
   \]

Finally, we sum the students who play only basketball, only volleyball, and both to find the total number of students who play either game:
   \[
   \text{Total students who play either game} = 8 + 6 + 2 = 16
   \]

Since there are 20 students in total in the class, we subtract the number of students who play either game from the total to find the number of students who do not play either game:
   \[
   \text{Students who do not play either game} = 20 - 16 = 4
   \]

Therefore, 4 students do not play either game.

First, let's determine the number of students who play basketball. Since half of the 20 students play basketball, we calculate:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
So, 10 students play basketball.

Next, let's find out how many students play volleyball. Two-fifths of the 20 students play volleyball, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]
So, 4 students play volleyball.

Now, we know that one-tenth of the students play both basketball and volleyball. Since there are 20 students in total, we calculate:
\[ \frac{20}{10} = 2 \]
So, 2 students play both basketball and volleyball.

To avoid double-counting students who play both games, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. The number of students who play at least one of the games is given by:
\[ 10 + 4 - 2 = 12 \]
So, 12 students play at least one of the games.

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who do not play either game is:

We start by determining how many students play basketball. We know that half of the 20 students play basketball, so:
[ text{Number of basketball players} = frac{20}{2} ]

Next, we need to find out how many students play volleyball, knowing that two-fifths of the students play volleyball. We can calculate this value as:
[ text{Number of volleyball players} = frac{20}{5} ]

Additionally, if one-tenth of the students play both basketball and volleyball, we can calculate the number of students who do so as:
[ text{Number of students playing both} = frac{20}{10} ]

Now, to find the number of students who play only basketball, we subtract the number of students who play both games from the total number of basketball players:
[ text{Only basketball players} = text{Number of basketball players} - text{Number of students playing both} ]

Similarly, to find the number of students who play only volleyball, we subtract the number of students who play both games from the total number of volleyball players:
[ text{Only volleyball players} = text{Number of volleyball players} - text{Number of students playing both} ]

To find the number of students who play neither game, we sum the number of students who play only basketball, only volleyball, and subtract the number of students who play both games (since they were counted twice):
[ text{Neither game players} = text{Only basketball players} + text{Only volleyball players} - text{Students playing both} ]

Finally, substituting back our values:
[ text{Neither game players} = left( frac{20}{2} - left( frac{20}{10} right) right) + left( frac{20}{5} - left( frac{20}{10} right) right) - left( frac{20}{10} right) ]

Now we use this reasoning in the code to compute the number of students who do not play either game.

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We know that there are 20 students in total.

2) Half of them play basketball, so we have:
   \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) students who play basketball.

3) Two-fifths of them play volleyball, so we have:
   \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) students who play volleyball.

4) One-tenth play both basketball and volleyball, so we have:
   \( \frac{1}{10} \times 20 = 2 \) students who play both.

5) To find the number of students who play either basketball or volleyball or both, we add the number of students who play basketball and volleyball and then subtract the number of students who play both (since those are counted twice). This is because the intersection has already been counted once in both groups:
   \( 10 + 8 - 2 = 16 \).

6) Therefore, the number of students who do not play either game is the total number of students minus the number of students who play either:
   \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

So, 4 students do not play either basketball or volleyball.

Let's denote the total number of students in the class as \( N \). Given \( N = 20 \).

Half of the students play basketball, so the number of students playing basketball is \( \frac{N}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Two-fifths of the students play volleyball, so the number of students playing volleyball is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \).

One-tenth of the students play both basketball and volleyball, so the number of students playing both games is \( \frac{1}{10} \times 20 = 2 \).

To find the number of students who play either basketball or volleyball or both, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The number of students who play either basketball or volleyball or both is \( 10 + 8 - 2 = 16 \).

The number of students who do not play either game is the total number of students minus the number who play at least one of the games, which is \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

However, we need to check the possibility of any overlap:
- Students who play basketball but do not play volleyball is \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) (since 2 play both).
- Students who play volleyball but do not play basketball is \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) (since 2 play both).
- Students who do not play at all is \( 2 - 2 = 0 \) (since 2 play both).

The total is \( 8 + 6 + 0 = 14 \) students who do not play either game, but we should also account for those who play both:
- Therefore, the actual number of students who do not play either game is \( 4 + 0 = 4 \).

Thus, the number of students who do not play either game is \( 4 \).

Next, calculate the number of students who play volleyball:

Now, to find the number of students who do not play either game, we subtract the total number of students playing at least one sport from the total number of students in the class:

2. Next, we need to determine how many students play volleyball:

3. We are also given that 10 students play both basketball and volleyball:

4. To find out how many students play only basketball, we subtract the number of students who play both games from the total number of basketball players:
\[ \text{Number of students only playing basketball} = 10 - 10 = 0 \]

5. Similarly, to find out how many students play only volleyball, we subtract the number of students who play both games from the total number of volleyball players:
\[ \text{Number of students only playing volleyball} = 8 - 10 = -2 \]

Since it's not possible to have a negative number of students, this indicates that those 2 students who play both basketball and volleyball have already been included in both the basketball and volleyball counts. Therefore, they are not playing either game and need to be excluded:

\[ \text{Number of students playing neither} = 20 - (0 + 8 + 10) = 20 - 18 = 2 \]

Next, we know that two-fifths of the students play volleyball:

Now, we know that one-tenth of the students play both basketball and volleyball:
\[ \frac{1}{10} \times 20 = 2 \text{ students play both basketball and volleyball} \]

Since these two groups (those who play volleyball and those who play both) overlap (they play both games), we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
\[ \text{Basketball + Volleyball} = \text{Basketball} + \text{Volleyball} - \text{Both} \]
\[ \text{Basketball + Volleyball} = 10 + 8 - 2 = 16 \]

Thus, 16 students play either basketball, volleyball, or both.
