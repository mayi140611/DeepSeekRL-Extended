#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To find out how far James drove, we need to calculate the distance for each part of his trip and then add them together.

First, for the first part of the trip, James drives at 30 mph for half an hour. Distance is calculated using the formula: distance = speed * time.

\[ \text{First part distance} = 30 \text{ mph} * 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, for the second part of the trip, he drives twice as long at twice the speed. The time he drives is 2 * 0.5 = 1 hour, and the speed is 2 * 30 = 60 mph.

\[ \text{Second part distance} = 60 \text{ mph} * 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance, we add the distances from each part: 

\[ \text{Total distance} = 15 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 75 \text{ miles} \]

First, we calculate the distance traveled at the initial speed:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the time he travels at the doubled speed:
\[ \text{Time}_2 = 2 \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

With the doubled speed:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances to obtain the total distance driven:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 15 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Let's calculate the distance James drove step by step.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 0.5 hours

   Distance = Speed × Time
   Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - Speed is twice the first leg's speed (which is 2 × 30 mph = 60 mph)
   - Time is twice the first leg's time (which is 2 × 0.5 hours = 1 hour)

   Distance = Speed × Time
   Distance = 60 mph × 1 hour = 60 miles

3. **Total distance:**
   Distance driven in the first leg + Distance driven in the second leg
   = 15 miles + 60 miles
   = 75 miles

So, James drove a total of 75 miles.

In the first half hour, James drives at 30 mph. The distance he would cover in half an hour at 30 mph is given by:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, James drives twice as long for twice the speed. So, the time is doubled:

\[ 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 1 \text{ hour} \]
and the speed is doubled:

\[ 30 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 60 \text{ mph} \]

The distance he covers in this time at 60 mph is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance he drives is the sum of the two distances:

\[ 15 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 75 \text{ miles} \]

James drives 30 mph for 0. 5 hours, so he drives \(30 \times 0. 5 = 15\) miles. Then he drives twice the speed, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) mph, for twice the time, which is \(0. 5 \times 2 = 1\) hour. So he drives \(60 \times 1 = 60\) miles in that second part. In total, James drives \(15 + 60 = 75\) miles.

James drives 30 mph for half an hour, which means he drives 30 \* 0.5 = 15 miles.
Then, he drives twice as long for twice the speed, which means he drives 15 * 2 = 30 miles for half an hour at twice the speed.

To find the total distance, we add the two distances: 15 + 30 = 45 miles.

First, let's calculate the distance James drove at the initial speed of 30 mph for half an hour.

Distance = Speed × Time

For the first part:
Speed = 30 mph
Time = 0.5 hours

Distance for the first part = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Now, for the second part, James drives twice the distance for twice the speed:

Distance = 15 miles × 2 = 30 miles

Since the speed in the second part is twice as fast as the first part (30 mph to 60 mph), we multiply the first part's duration by two to get the additional time:

Additional time = 30 minutes × 2 = 60 minutes. Let's convert this into hours: 1 hour / 2 = 0.5 hours.

So for the second part, he drives for 1 hour at 60 mph.

Distance for the second part = 60 mph × 1 hour = 60 miles

Now we add the two distances:

Total distance = 15 miles + 60 miles = 75 miles

First, let's calculate the distance James drove at the initial speed of 30 mph for half an hour.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part:
Speed = 30 mph
Time = 0.5 hours
Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Next, we need to calculate the distance for the second part of the trip. He drives twice as long (1 hour) at twice the speed (60 mph).

For the second part:
Speed = 60 mph
Time = 1 hour
Distance = 60 * 1 = 60 miles

Finally, we add the distances from both parts of the trip to find the total distance James drove.

Total distance = 15 miles + 60 miles = 75 miles

First, let's calculate the distance James drove during the first half hour.

Distance = Speed × Time

For the first part:
Speed = 30 mph
Time = 0.5 hours
Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance he drove during the second part:
Distance = 2 × Speed (twice the speed)
Speed = 30 mph × 2 = 60 mph

Time = 0.5 hours × 2 = 1 hour

Now, we calculate the distance for the second part:
Distance = 60 mph × 1 hour = 60 miles

Finally, add up the distances from both parts:
Total distance = 15 miles + 60 miles = 75 miles

Therefore, James drove a total of 75 miles.

First, we calculate the distance James drives at 30 mph for half an hour. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for half an hour (0.5 hours):

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 30 \times 0.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate his speed and time for the second part of the trip. He drives twice as fast as the first part at 60 mph, so:

\[ \text{Time}_2 = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

And the distance for the second part is:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 60 \times 1 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add up the distances from both parts of the trip:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 15 + 60 = 75 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance James drove.

James drives 30 mph for half an hour, so he travels a distance of \(30 \times 0.5 = 15\) miles.

Then he drives for twice the time, which is \(0.5 \times 2 = 1\) hour, and at twice the speed, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) mph.

So, the distance he drives at the increased speed is \(60 \times 1 = 60\) miles.

In total, James drives \(15 + 60 = 75\) miles.

First, we calculate the distance James drove at 30 mph for half an hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

Next, we calculate the distance he drove at twice the speed (which is 60 mph) for twice the time (which is 1 hour):
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 1 hour
Distance = 60 miles

Finally, we add the two distances together to find the total distance James drove:
Total distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
Total distance = 15 miles + 60 miles
Total distance = 75 miles

Therefore, the answer is 75 miles.

James drives 30 mph for half an hour, which is 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. Then he drives twice as long, which is 60 minutes, and twice the speed, which is 60 * 2 = 120 mph. The distance he drives at the higher speed is 120 * 60 = 7200 miles. So in total, he drives 15 + 7200 = 7215 miles.

To find out how far James drove in total, we'll calculate the distance for each part of his journey separately.

First, let's find the distance he covered in the first half-hour at 30 mph. distance = speed * time, so distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hour = 15 miles.

The second part of his journey involves driving twice as long for twice the speed. Twice the speed is 60 mph, and he drives for twice as long as the first half-hour, which is 1 hour. So, the second part of the journey is an 1-hour drive at 60 mph.

Now, let's calculate the distance for the second part of the journey using the same formula: distance = speed * time. So, distance = 60 mph * 1 hour = 60 miles.

Finally, to find the total distance James drove, we add the distance of both parts: 15 miles + 60 miles = 75 miles.
