120 members in total.
Number of adults = 40% of 120 = 0.4 * 120 = 48 adults.
Number of children = Total members - Number of adults = 120 - 48 = 72 children.

To find how many more children there are than adults, subtract the number of adults from the number of children:
72 children - 48 adults = 24 more children.

#### GENERATION 12 RESPONSE ####

system
The church has 120 members in total.

40% are adults, so the number of adults is \( 120 \times \frac{40}{100} = 48 \).

The rest are children, so the number of children is \( 120 - 48 = 72 \).

To find how many more children there are than adults, we subtract the number of adults from the number of children:

\( 72 - 48 = 24 \).

Therefore, there are 24 more children than adults.
