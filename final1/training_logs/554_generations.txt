#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
First, let's calculate the number of shoes Edward has. Since Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has, and Brian has 22 pairs of shoes, then Edward has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) pairs of shoes.

Next, we know that Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has. Therefore, Jacob has \(\frac{66}{2} = 33\) pairs of shoes.

To find the total number of pairs of shoes they have, we sum the number of shoes each person has: Jacob + Edward + Brian = \(33 + 66 + 22 = 121\).

So, the total number of pairs of shoes they have is 121.

system
Let's start by defining the number of shoes each person has in terms of Brian's shoes:

- Brian has 22 pairs of shoes.
- Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has. So, Edward has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) pairs of shoes.
- Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has. So, Jacob has \(\frac{66}{2} = 33\) pairs of shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pairs of shoes they have:

Total pairs of shoes = Brian's shoes + Edward's shoes + Jacob's shoes
Total pairs of shoes = \(22 + 66 + 33\)

Let's add them up:

Total pairs of shoes = \(22 + 66 + 33 = 121\)

Therefore, they have a total of 121 pairs of shoes.

system
Let's calculate this step-by-step.

First, we find out how many pairs of shoes Edward has. According to the information given:

Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has.
Brian has 22 pairs of shoes.

So, Edward has 3 * 22 = 66 pairs of shoes.

Next, we find out how many pairs of shoes Jacob has. We know Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has:

Jacob has 66 / 2 = 33 pairs of shoes.

Now we can find the total number of pairs of shoes they have by adding all of their shoes together:

Brian's shoes (22) + Edward's shoes (66) + Jacob's shoes (33) = 121 pairs of shoes.

So they have a total of 121 pairs of shoes.

To find out how many pairs of shoes they have in total, we can start by calculating the number of shoes each person has based on the information provided.

1. Brian has 22 pairs of shoes.
2. Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has, so Edward has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) pairs of shoes.
3. Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has, so Jacob has \(66 / 2 = 33\) pairs of shoes.
4. To find the total number of pairs of shoes, we sum up the pairs each person has, which is \(22 + 66 + 33 = 121\) pairs.

So, they have a total of 121 pairs of shoes.

system
Let's denote the number of pairs of shoes each person has as follows:
- Jacob: \( J \)
- Edward: \( E \)
- Brian: \( B \)

From the information provided:
1. Brian has 22 pairs of shoes: \( B = 22 \).
2. Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has: \( E = 3 \times B \).
3. Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has: \( J = \frac{1}{2} E \).

First, calculate the number of shoes Edward has:
\[ E = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, calculate the number of shoes Jacob has:
\[ J = \frac{1}{2} \times 66 = 33 \]

To find the total number of shoes they all have together, add up the shoes each person has:
\[ \text{Total} = J + E + B = 33 + 66 + 22 = 121 \]

Therefore, they have a total of 121 pairs of shoes.

system
To find the total number of pairs of shoes they have, we'll follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of shoes Edward has.
2. Determine the number of shoes Jacob has.
3. Add up the number of shoes each person has to get the total number of shoes.

First, we know:
- Brian has 22 pairs of shoes.
- Edward has 3 times the number of shoes that Brian has.
- Jacob has half the number of shoes that Edward has.

Now, let's calculate this:

### Step 1: Edward's shoes
Edward's number of shoes = 3 * Brian's number of shoes  
Edward's shoes = 3 * 22 = 66 pairs of shoes

### Step 2: Jacob's shoes
Jacob's number of shoes = 0.5 * Edward's number of shoes  
Jacob's shoes = 0.5 * 66 = 33 pairs of shoes

### Step 3: Total number of shoes
Total number of shoes = Brian's shoes + Edward's shoes + Jacob's shoes  
Total number of shoes = 22 + 66 + 33  
Total number of shoes = 121 pairs of shoes

### Conclusion:
They have a total of 121 pairs of shoes.

Next, calculate how many pairs of shoes Jacob has:
\[ Jacob = \frac{1}{2} \times Edward = \frac{1}{2} \times 66 = 33 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, add up all the shoes they have:
\[ Brian + Edward + Jacob = 22 + 66 + 33 = 121 \text{ pairs} \]

To find out the total number of shoes they have, we first need to determine how many shoes Jacob, Edward, and Brian have individually.

1. Brian has 22 pairs of shoes.

2. Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has.
   \[
   \text{Edward's shoes} = 3 \times \text{Brian's shoes} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \text{ pairs of shoes}
   \]

3. Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has.
   \[
   \text{Jacob's shoes} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Edward's shoes} = \frac{1}{2} \times 66 = 33 \text{ pairs of shoes}
   \]

Now, to find the total number of shoes they have:
\[
\text{Total shoes} = \text{Brian's shoes} + \text{Edward's shoes} + \text{Jacob's shoes}
\]
\[
\text{Total shoes} = 22 + 66 + 33 = 121 \text{ pairs of shoes}

To find the total number of pairs of shoes that Jacob, Edward, and Brian have, we follow these steps:

1. **Brian's shoes**: Brian has 22 pairs of shoes.

2. **Edward's shoes**: Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has. So, we multiply the number of Brian's shoes by 3:
   \[
   \text{Edward's shoes} = 3 \times 22 = 66
   \]

3. **Jacob's shoes**: Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has. So, we divide the number of Edward's shoes by 2:
   \[
   \text{Jacob's shoes} = \frac{66}{2} = 33
   \]

4. **Total number of shoes**: To find the total number of pairs of shoes, we add the number of shoes Jacob, Edward, and Brian have:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes} = \text{Jacob's shoes} + \text{Edward's shoes} + \text{Brian's shoes} = 33 + 66 + 22
   \]

5. **Calculation**:
   \[
   33 + 66 + 22 = 121
   \]

Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes they have is \( 121 \).

Let's break down the information given:

1. Brian has 22 pairs of shoes.
2. Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has.
3. Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has.

First, we'll calculate how many pairs of shoes Edward has:
\[ Edward's\ shoes = 3 \times Brian's\ shoes = 3 \times 22 \]

Next, we'll calculate how many pairs of shoes Jacob has:
\[ Jacob's\ shoes = \frac{Edward's\ shoes}{2} \]

Finally, we'll calculate the total number of shoes all three have by summing up their individual counts of shoes.

Let's do the calculations:

\[ Edward's\ shoes = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]
\[ Jacob's\ shoes = \frac{66}{2} = 33 \]

Now, let's find the total number of shoes:

\[ Total = Brian's\ shoes + Edward's\ shoes + Jacob's\ shoes = 22 + 66 + 33 \]

\[ Total = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ Total = 88 + 33 = 121 \]

Therefore, they have a total of 121 pairs of shoes.
