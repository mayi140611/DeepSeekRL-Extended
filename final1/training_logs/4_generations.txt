<reasoning>
James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. This means he writes at a rate of 3 pages * 2 friends * 2 letters = 12 pages per week. 

There are 52 weeks in a year. Multiplying the pages he writes per week by 52 gives us 12 pages/week * 52 weeks/yr = 624 pages/year.

Each week, James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week, which totals 6 pages written each week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of pages James writes in a year is:

\[ 6\ \text{pages/week} \times 52\ \text{weeks/year} = 312\ \text{pages/year} \]

Therefore, the answer is 312 pages.

First, let's calculate the number of pages James writes in one week. Since he writes a letter to 2 different friends twice a week and each letter is 3 pages long, the calculation would be as follows:

2 friends * 3 pages/letter * 2 times/week = 12 pages/week

Next, we need to calculate how many letters he writes in one year. We know that there are 52 weeks in a year, so:

12 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 624 pages/year

So, James writes 624 pages a year.

To determine how many pages James writes in a year, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Pages per letter per week**: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends. Therefore, the number of pages per letter is 3.

2. **Frequency of writing letters**: James writes these letters twice a week.

So, the number of pages James writes per week is:
\[ \text{Pages per letter} \times \text{Frequency per week} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pages per week} \]

3. **Number of weeks in a year**: A typical year has 52 weeks.

4. **Total pages per year**: Now we multiply the number of pages he writes per week by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ \text{Pages per week} \times \text{Weeks per year} = 6 \times 52 = 312 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, James writes 312 pages in a year.

He writes 312 pages in a year.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####

To determine how many pages James writes in a year, we can break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of letters per week:**
   James writes a letter to 2 different friends twice a week. So, the number of letters he writes per week is:
   \[
   2 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ letters per friend} = 4 \text{ letters per week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of letters per day:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the number of letters he writes per day is:
   \[
   4 \text{ letters per week} \div 7 \text{ days per week} = \frac{4}{7} \text{ letters per day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of letters in a year:**
   There are 52 weeks in a year, so the number of letters he writes in a year is:
   \[
   4 \text{ letters per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks per year} = 208 \text{ letters per year}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages written in a year:**
   Since each letter is 3 pages, the total number of pages he writes in a year is:
   \[
   208 \text{ letters per year} \times 3 \text{ pages per letter} = 624 \text{ pages per year}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of pages James writes in a year is \boxed{624} pages.

To determine how many pages James writes in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of pages written in one friend's letter:**
   - James writes a 3-page letter to one friend twice a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages written to one friend per week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pages/letter} \times 2 \text{ letters/week} = 6 \text{ pages/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pages written to both friends:**
   - James has 2 friends, so the total number of pages written to both friends per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ pages/week} \times 2 \text{ friends} = 12 \text{ pages/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages written to both friends in one week:**
   - Since James writes to both friends, the total number of pages written in one week is:
     \[
     12 \text{ pages/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages written in one year:**
   - Assuming there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of pages written in one year is:
     \[
     12 \text{ pages/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 624 \text{ pages/year}
     \]

Therefore, James writes \boxed{624} pages a year.

To calculate the total number of pages James writes in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of letters written per week:**
   James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.
   - Total letters written per week = 2 friends * 3 pages/friend * 2 times/week = 12 letters/week.

2. **Calculate the total pages written per week:**
   - Each letter is 3 pages, so the total pages per week = 12 letters/week * 3 pages/letter = 36 pages/week.

3. **Calculate the total pages written per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total pages per year = 36 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 1872 pages/year.

To calculate the total number of pages James writes in a year, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Pages per letter**: James writes one 3-page letter to two different friends twice a week.
2. **Letters per week**: Each pair of friends gets one 3-page letter twice a week, so each pair writes 6 pages per week.
3. **Friends per pair**: Since James writes to two different friends, there are 2 pairs of friends.
4. **Letters per pair per week**: Each pair writes 6 pages twice a week, so each pair writes 12 letters per week.
5. **Pages per pair per week**: Each pair writes 12 letters to 2 friends, so each pair writes 12 * 2 = 24 pages per week.

**Daily activities**:
- Each pair writes 24 pages a week, 24 pages * 52 weeks = 1,248 pages per year.
- This number would be incorrect because it doesn't take into account the double writing to each friend.

**Double writing**:
- Each pair writes to 2 friends, so each pair writes 4 letters per week.
- Each pair writes 6 pages to each of the two friends, so each pair writes 6 * 2 = 12 pages per week.
- James writes to 2 pairs of friends, so James writes 12 * 2 = 24 letters per week.
- James writes to 2 pairs of friends twice a week, so he writes 24 * 2 = 48 letters per week.

**Final calculation**:

- The total number of pages James writes in a year is 48 * 52 = 2496.

**Final answer**: James writes **2496 pages in a year**.

To find out how many pages James writes in a year, we need to multiply the number of pages he writes per letter, the number of friends he writes to, the number of times a week he writes, and the number of weeks in a year.

Reasoning:
1. Each letter is 3 pages.
2. James writes to 2 friends.
3. He writes twice a week.
4. There are 52 weeks in a year.

Calculation:
Pages per week = 3 pages/letter * 2 letters/friend * 2 times/week = 12 pages/week
Total pages in a year = 12 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 624 pages/year

Answer:
James writes 624 pages to his friends in a year.

First, we need to determine how many pages James writes in a week. He writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.

First week:
3 pages/friend * 2 friends = 6 pages/week

Second week:
3 pages/friend * 2 friends = 6 pages/week

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of pages written in a week:
6 pages/week + 6 pages/week = 12 pages/week

Next, we need to determine how many weeks are in a year:
52 weeks/year

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages written in a year:
12 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 624 pages/year

So, James writes 624 pages in a year.

To determine how many pages James writes a year, we need to perform a series of calculations:

1. James sends letters twice a week to 2 friends, which totals 4 letters per week.
2. Each letter is 3 pages, so each week he writes \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pages.
3. There are 52 weeks in a year, so in a year, he writes \(12 \times 52 = 624\) pages.

Therefore, the answer is 624 pages in a year.

To determine how many pages James writes in a year, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of letters James writes in one week:**
   James writes 3-page letters to 2 different friends twice a week. So, the total number of letters he writes in one week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ pages/letter} \times 2 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ times/week} = 12 \text{ letters/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of letters James writes in one year:**
   There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of letters he writes in one year is:
   \[
   12 \text{ letters/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 624 \text{ letters/year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages James writes in one year:**
   Since each letter is 3 pages long, the total number of pages he writes in one year is:
   \[
   624 \text{ letters/year} \times 3 \text{ pages/letter} = 1872 \text{ pages/year}
