Before buying new diaries, the sister had 8 diaries. Last summer, she bought double the number she had, so she bought 8 * 2 = 16 diaries. She then lost 1/4 of what she had, which is 16 * 1/4 = 4 diaries. Therefore, Natalie's sister now has 8 + 16 - 4 = 20 diaries.

Before buying new diaries, Natalie's sister had 8 diaries. Last summer, she bought double the number she had, which is \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) diaries. After buying, she had a total of \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) diaries. Then, she lost 1/4 of what she had, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \) diaries. So, she loses 6 and now has \( 24 - 6 = 18 \) diaries.

Initially, Natalie's sister had 8 small diaries. Last summer, she bought double the number she had, which is 8 * 2 = 16 diaries. 

Then, she lost 1/4 of what she had, which is 16 * 1/4 = 4 diaries. 

To find out how many diaries she has now, we need to subtract the lost diaries from the total bought: 16 - 4 = 12 diaries.

So, Natalie's sister has 12 diaries now.

system
Before last summer, Natalie's sister had 8 diaries. Last summer, she bought double the number, which is 8 * 2 = 16 diaries. She then bought double this amount again, which is 16 * 2 = 32 more diaries. So, total diaries before any loss is 8 + 16 + 32 = 56.

She lost 1/4 of the total diaries, which is 56 * 1/4 = 14 diaries.

Therefore, the number of diaries she has now is 56 - 14 = 42.

Initially, Natalie's sister had 8 small diaries. Last summer, she bought double the number of diaries she had initially, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) diaries.

Then, she lost \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the 24 diaries she had after the purchase, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \) diaries.

So, the total number of diaries Natalie's sister has now is \( 16 + 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \).
