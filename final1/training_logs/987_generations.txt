To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of flour Hannah should use based on the given ratios of banana mush to flour and the number of bananas she plans to use.

1. **Banana Mush Calculation**: 
   - First, we calculate how many cups of banana mush can be made from 20 bananas. Since it takes 4 bananas to make one cup of banana mush, we divide the total number of bananas by 4:
     \[
     \text{Banana mush} = \frac{20 \text{ bananas}}{4 \text{ bananas/cup}} = 5 \text{ cups of mush}
     \]

2. **Flour Calculation**:
   - Next, using the given ratio that 3 cups of flour are needed for every cup of banana mush, we multiply the amount of banana mush by 3 to find the amount of flour:
     \[
     \text{Flour} = 5 \text{ cups of mush} \times 3 \text{ cups of flour/cup of mush} = 15 \text{ cups of flour}
     \]

So, Hannah should use 15 cups of flour.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many cups of flour Hannah should use.

1. **Bananas to Cups of Muffin Mixture**: If 4 bananas make one cup of banana mush, then 20 bananas would make:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ bananas}}{4 \text{ bananas/cup}} = 5 \text{ cups of mush}
   \]

2. **Cups of Flour per Cup of Muffin Mixture**: The recipe requires 3 cups of flour for every 1 cup of mush. Therefore, for 5 cups of mush, the amount of flour needed would be:
   \[
   5 \text{ cups of mush} \times 3 \text{ cups of flour/cup of mush} = 15 \text{ cups of flour}
   \]

Therefore, Hannah should use 15 cups of flour.

To find out how many cups of flour Hannah should use, we need to first determine how much banana mush she can make with 20 bananas. Since it takes 4 bananas to make one cup of banana mush, we can calculate the amount of banana mush by dividing the total number of bananas by 4: 20 bananas / 4 = 5 cups of banana mush.

Next, we need to calculate how much flour Hannah should use, knowing that she needs 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of cups of banana mush by 3: 5 cups of banana mush * 3 = 15 cups of flour.

To determine how many cups of flour Hannah should use, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of banana mush made from 20 bananas.
2. Determine how much flour is needed based on the amount of banana mush.

Given:
- 4 bananas make 1 cup of banana mush.
- 3 cups of flour are needed for every cup of banana mush.

First, calculate the amount of banana mush from 20 bananas:
\[ \text{Banana mush} = \frac{20 \text{ bananas}}{4 \text{ bananas/cup of mush}} = 5 \text{ cups of mush} \]

Next, since 3 cups of flour are needed for each cup of banana mush:
\[ \text{Cups of flour needed} = 5 \text{ cups of mush} \times 3 \text{ cups of flour/cup of mush} = 15 \text{ cups of flour} \]

So, Hannah should use 15 cups of flour.

First, we need to determine how many cups of banana mush can be made from 20 bananas. Since it takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush, we divide 20 bananas by 4:

$$
\frac{20 \text{ bananas}}{4 \text{ bananas/cup mush}} = 5 \text{ cups of mush}
$$

Now, we can calculate how much flour Hannah needs. Given that she needs 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush, we multiply the number of cups of mush by 3:

$$
5 \text{ cups of mush} \times 3 \text{ cups of flour/cup mush} = 15 \text{ cups of flour}

So, Hannah should use 15 cups of flour to make the banana bread.

To determine how many cups of flour Hannah should use, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of banana mush:**
   - Given that it takes 4 bananas to make 1 cup of banana mush, and Hannah uses 20 bananas, we can calculate the total amount of banana mush by dividing the total number of bananas by the number of bananas needed per cup.
   - \[
   \text{Total banana mush} = \frac{20 \text{ bananas}}{4 \text{ bananas/cup}} = 5 \text{ cups of banana mush}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of flour needed:**
   - Hannah needs 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. 
   - Since she has 5 cups of banana mush, the total amount of flour needed can be calculated by multiplying the number of cups of banana mush by the ratio of flour to banana mush.
   - \[
   \text{Flour needed} = 5 \text{ cups of banana mush} \times 3 \text{ cups of flour/cup} = 15 \text{ cups of flour}
   \]

Therefore, Hannah should use 15 cups of flour.
