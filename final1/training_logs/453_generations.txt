system
To find the number of minutes of advertising, we need to subtract the total time allocated to the other segments from the total newscast time.

Total newscast time = 30 minutes
Time for national news = 12 minutes
Time for international news = 5 minutes
Time for sports = 5 minutes
Time for weather forecasts = 2 minutes

First, we calculate the total time for the segments that are not advertisements:
\[ 12 \text{ (national news) } + 5 \text{ (international news) } + 5 \text{ (sports) } + 2 \text{ (weather forecasts) } = 24 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract this total from the overall newscast time to find the time allocated to advertisements:
\[ 30 \text{ (newscast time) } - 24 \text{ (non-advertisement time) } = 6 \text{ minutes} \]

So, there are 6 minutes of advertising in the newscast.

To find out how many minutes of advertising are in the newscast, we need to calculate the total time allocated to news and sports, and then subtract this from the total half-hour newscast time.

First, we add up the time allocated to national news, international news, and sports:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes (national news)} + 5 \text{ minutes (international news)} + 5 \text{ minutes (sports)} = 22 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract this total from the half-hour newscast time. Since one half-hour is 30 minutes, we have:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 22 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the newscast includes 8 minutes of advertising.

To find out how many minutes of advertising are in the newscast, we need to subtract the time spent on national news, international news, sports, and weather forecasts from the total newscast time, which is 30 minutes.

First, let's add up the times for the non-advertising segments:

National news: 12 minutes
International news: 5 minutes
Sports: 5 minutes
Weather forecasts: 2 minutes

Total for non-advertising segments: 12 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 24 minutes

Now, subtract this total from the newscast's total duration:

30 minutes (total newscast) - 24 minutes (non-advertising segments) = 6 minutes

Therefore, there are 6 minutes of advertising in the newscast.

To determine the number of minutes of advertisements in the newscast, we first need to find out the total duration of the newscast. Since the newscast is half an hour, we convert this to minutes: 30 minutes / 2 = 15 minutes.

Next, we add up the durations of the segments that are not advertisements: 12 minutes (national news) + 5 minutes (international news) + 5 minutes (sports) + 2 minutes (weather forecasts) = 24 minutes.

Finally, we subtract the total duration of the non-advertising segments from the total duration of the newscast to find the length of the advertisements: 15 minutes (total duration) - 24 minutes (non-advertising segments) = -9 minutes.

However, it's not possible to have a negative duration for an advertisement. This means there might be an error in the provided information, as the total duration of the non-advertising segments exceeds the total duration of the newscast.

To find the total time spent on news and weather, we add up the time for each segment:

12 minutes (national news) + 5 minutes (international news) + 5 minutes (sports) + 2 minutes (weather forecasts) = 24 minutes.

Since the entire newscast is 30 minutes long, the remaining time must be spent on advertisements:

30 minutes (total newscast time) - 24 minutes (news + weather) = 6 minutes of advertisements.

First, let's calculate the total duration of the newscast:
12 (national news) + 5 (international news) + 5 (sports) + 2 (weather forecasts) = 24 minutes

The total newscast duration is 30 minutes, so to find the duration of advertisements, we subtract the total newscast duration from the total airtime:
30 (total newscast time) - 24 (total newscast duration) = 6 minutes of advertisements

To find out how many minutes of advertisements are in the newscast, we need to subtract the total minutes of the other segments from the total newscast time. 

The total newscast time is 30 minutes. 

The other segments are:
- National news: 12 minutes
- International news: 5 minutes
- Sports: 5 minutes
- Weather forecasts: 2 minutes

First, we add up the minutes of these segments:
\[ 12 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes of these segments from the total newscast time:
\[ 30 - 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 minutes of advertisements in the newscast.

To determine the number of minutes of advertising in the newscast, we first need to find out the total duration of the newscast and then subtract the time allocated to national news, international news, sports, and weather forecasts.

The total duration of the newscast is given as 30 minutes. 

The time allocated to national news is 12 minutes.
The time allocated to international news is 5 minutes.
The time allocated to sports is 5 minutes.
The time allocated to weather forecasts is 2 minutes.

So, the total time for national news, international news, sports, and weather forecasts is:

\[ 12 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 24 \text{ minutes} \]

The rest of the newscast is for advertisements. Therefore, the number of minutes of advertising is:

To find out how many minutes of advertising are in the newscast, we first need to calculate the total time spent on news segments and sports. The time spent on national news is 12 minutes, international news is 5 minutes, and sports is 5 minutes, which totals:

12 + 5 + 5 = 22 minutes of news and sports.

The newscast is one hour long, which is 60 minutes. To find the time spent on advertisements, we subtract the time spent on news and sports from the total time of the newscast:

60 - 22 = 38 minutes of advertisements.

To find out how many minutes of advertising are in the newscast, we first need to add up the total time allocated for the other parts of the newscast:

- National news: 12 minutes
- International news: 5 minutes
- Sports: 5 minutes
- Weather forecasts: 2 minutes

Total time for non-advertising segments = 12 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 24 minutes

The newscast is 30 minutes long, so the time allocated for advertisements is:

Total time of newscast - Time for non-advertising segments = Time for advertisements

30 minutes - 24 minutes = 6 minutes

To find the number of minutes of advertising in the newscast, we first need to determine the total duration of the newscast. The newscast duration is given as 30 minutes.

Next, we sum up the durations of the segments mentioned for the national news, international news, sports, and weather forecasts:

- National news: 12 minutes
- International news: 5 minutes
- Sports: 5 minutes
- Weather forecasts: 2 minutes

Adding these up:

\[12 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 24\]

So, the total time for these segments is 24 minutes.

Now, to find the duration of the advertisements, we subtract the total duration of these segments from the total duration of the newscast:

\[30 - 24 = 6\]

Therefore, there are 6 minutes of advertisements in the newscast.

To find out how many minutes of advertising are in the newscast, we first need to calculate the total duration of the news segments. This can be done by adding up the time each type of news takes up:

12 minutes (national news) + 5 minutes (international news) + 5 minutes (sports) + 2 minutes (weather forecasts) = 24 minutes

The newscast is 30 minutes long, so to find the number of minutes of advertisements, we subtract the total news time from the total newscast time:

30 minutes (total newscast) - 24 minutes (total news segments) = 6 minutes

So, there are 6 minutes of advertising in the newscast.

To find out how many minutes of advertising are in the newscast, we need to subtract the total time of the national, international, sports, and weather forecasts from the total duration of the newscast.

First, let's add up the time for national news, international news, sports, and weather forecasts:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes (national news)} + 5 \text{ minutes (international news)} + 5 \text{ minutes (sports)} + 2 \text{ minutes (weather)} \]

\[ = 12 + 5 + 5 + 2 \]
\[ = 24 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract this total from the half-hour newscast, which is 30 minutes:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (total newscast)} - 24 \text{ minutes (other segments)} \]

\[ = 30 - 24 \]
\[ = 6 \text{ minutes} \]

So, 6 minutes of the newscast are advertisements.

To find out how many minutes of advertising are in the newscast, we first need to add up the time spent on national, international, sports, and weather forecasts. The total time spent on these segments is \(12 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 24\) minutes.

The newscast is 30 minutes long, so if we subtract the time spent on the segments we've accounted for from the total time, we get the time spent on advertisements. 

Thus, the time for advertisements is \(30 - 24 = 6\) minutes.
