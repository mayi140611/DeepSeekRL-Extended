#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Last year Jessica paid: $1000 (rent) + $200 (food) + $100 (car insurance) = $1300 each month
This year (for rent): $1300 * 1.30 = $1690
This year (for food): $200 * 1.50 = $300
This year (for car insurance): $100 * 3 = $300
Total monthly cost this year = $1690 (rent) + $300 (food) + $300 (car insurance) = $2290
Total yearly cost this year: $2290 * 12 = $27480
Total yearly cost last year: $1300 * 12 = $15600
Difference this year compared to last year = $27480 - $15600 = $11880

Last year Jessica's total monthly expenses were $1000 + $200 + $100 = $1300. This year, her rent cost is 130% (30% increase) of the previous amount, so $1300 * 130/100 = $1690. Her food costs 150% (50% increase) of the previous amount, so $200 * 150/100 = $300. Her car insurance costs three times the previous amount, so $100 * 3 = $300. This year, Jessica's total monthly expenses are $1690 + $300 + $300 = $2290. This year Jessica's expenses are $2290 - $1300 = $990 more than last year.

Last year Jessica's total monthly expenses were $1000 for rent, $200 for food, and $100 for car insurance, which sums up to $1300. Therefore, her annual expenses last year were $1300 * 12 = $15600.

This year, her rent goes up by 30%, so the new rent cost is $1000 * 1.3 = $1300. The food costs go up by 50%, so the new food cost is $200 * 1.5 = $300. The cost of her car insurance triples, so now it's $100 * 3 = $300. Therefore, her new annual expenses are $1300 + $300 + $300 = $1900.

The difference in total annual expenses between this year and last year is $1900 - $15600 = -$13700. Therefore, Jessica pays $13700 less for her expenses over the whole year compared to last year.

This problem can be divided into monthly expenses and calculate the total difference over the year using the new cost for each category.

Jessica's rent used to be $1000 but this year, it goes up by 30%. So, the increase in rent this year compared with last year is 0.30*1000 = $300.
Jessica's food costs increased by 50% compared to last year. So, the increase in food cost over the past year is 0.50*200 = $100.
Car insurance cost this year is tripled compared to last year. So, the increase in car insurance cost this year is 3*100 = $300.
Now Jessica's new rent, food, and car insurance cost this year will be $1300, $300, and $300, respectively.
The total difference over the whole year compared to last year is 1300 + 300 + 300 = $1900.

The cost of Jessica's rent goes up by 30% * $1000 = $300.
The cost of her food now is $200 * 50% = $100 more than last year.
The cost of her car insurance now is 3 * $100 = $300 more than last year.
Jessica's expenses this year are now $1000 + $300 + $300 + $100 = $1700 each month.
Last year Jessica paid $1000 + $200 + $100 = $1300 each month.
Jessica's expenses this year are $1700 - $1300 = $400 more than last year.
Therefore, the answer is 400.
