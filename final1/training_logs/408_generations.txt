Frank sold 5 cars each day for the first 3 days, which totals \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cars. Then he sold 3 cars each day for the next 4 days, which totals \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cars. So far, he has sold \(15 + 12 = 27\) cars. To meet his quota of 50 cars in 30 days, he needs to sell \(50 - 27 = 23\) cars in the remaining 27 days.

In the first three days, Frank sold 5 cars each day, so he sold 3 * 5 = 15 cars. In the next four days, he sold 3 cars each day, so he sold 4 * 3 = 12 cars. In total, he sold 15 + 12 = 27 cars in the first seven days. He needs to sell 50 - 27 = 23 cars for the remaining 23 days to meet his quota.

system
To determine how many cars Frank needs to sell in the remaining days to meet his quota of 50 cars, we need to calculate the total number of cars he has already sold and then subtract that from his quota.

Firstly, Frank sold 5 cars each day for the first 3 days. So, the total number of cars sold in the first 3 days is:
\[ 5 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Frank sold 3 cars each day for the next 4 days. So, the total number of cars sold in the next 4 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the cars sold in the first 3 days and the next 4 days together:
\[ 15 \text{ cars} + 12 \text{ cars} = 27 \text{ cars} \]

Now, to meet his quota of 50 cars, Frank needs to sell:
\[ 50 \text{ cars} - 27 \text{ cars} = 23 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, Frank needs to sell 23 cars for the remaining days to meet his quota.

Frank sold 5 cars each day for the first 3 days, which totals to \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cars. For the next 4 days, he sold 3 cars each day, which totals to \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cars. So, in the first 7 days, he sold a total of \(15 + 12 = 27\) cars. To meet his quota of 50 cars sold over 30 days, he needs to sell \(50 - 27 = 23\) cars in the remaining \(30 - 7 = 23\) days.

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####


system
First, let's calculate how many cars Frank has already sold. In the first three days, he sold 5 cars each day, so he sold \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cars. In the next four days, he sold 3 cars each day, so he sold \(4 \times 3 = 12\) cars. 

Adding those numbers together, Frank has sold \(15 + 12 = 27\) cars in the first seven days.

The total quota is 50 cars. To find out how many cars he still needs to sell, we subtract the number he has already sold from the total quota. So, he needs to sell \(50 - 27 = 23\) cars in the remaining days.

Now, let's consider that the month is 30 days long. Subtracting the first seven days, \(30 - 7 = 23\) days, he needs to sell the remaining 23 cars to meet his quota for the month.

Frank sold 5 cars for the first 3 days, which totals to \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cars. Then he sold 3 cars per day for the next 4 days, which totals to \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cars. So far, he has sold \(15 + 12 = 27\) cars.

To meet his quota of 50 cars, he needs to sell \(50 - 27 = 23\) cars in the remaining days of the month.

Since the month is 30 days long, the remaining days are \(30 - 7 = 23\) days.

Therefore, Frank needs to sell 23 cars for the remaining days to meet his quota.
