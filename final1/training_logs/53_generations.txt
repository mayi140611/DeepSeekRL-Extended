system
To calculate how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt, we need to calculate the cost of each type of product and then find the difference.

The cost of ice cream: 
\[ 10 \text{ cartons} \times \$4 \text{ per carton} = \$40 \]

The cost of frozen yoghurt:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$1 \text{ per carton} = \$4 \]

The difference in cost:
\[ \$40 - \$4 = \$36 \]

Therefore, Caleb spent \$36 more on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt.

First, calculate the cost of the ice cream:
10 cartons * $4/carton = $40

Next, calculate the cost of the frozen yoghurt:
4 cartons * $1/carton = $4

Subtract the frozen yoghurt cost from the ice cream cost to find how much more was spent on ice cream:
$40 - $4 = $36

Therefore, Caleb spent $36 more on ice cream.

To determine how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt, we first need to calculate the total cost of each.

The total cost of ice cream is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total cost of ice cream} = 10 \text{ cartons} \times \$4 \text{ per carton} = \$40 \]

The total cost of frozen yoghurt is:
\[ \text{Total cost of frozen yoghurt} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$1 \text{ per carton} = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the total cost of ice cream and the total cost of frozen yoghurt:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$40 - \$4 = \$36 \]

So, Caleb spent \$36 more on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt.

Let's calculate the total cost of ice cream and frozen yogurt that Caleb bought.

Ice cream:
- Number of cartons bought: 10
- Cost per carton: $4
- Total cost of ice cream: 10 × $4 = $40

Frozen yogurt:
- Number of cartons bought: 4
- Cost per carton: $1
- Total cost of frozen yogurt: 4 × $1 = $4

Now, let's find the difference between the total cost of ice cream and the total cost of frozen yogurt.

Differece = Cost of ice cream - Cost of frozen yogurt
Differece = $40 - $4 = $36

Therefore, Caleb spent $36 more on ice cream than on frozen yogurt.

To calculate how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt, we first need to calculate the total cost for each of them.

First, let's calculate the cost for ice cream:

Ice cream cost = Number of cartons of ice cream * Cost per carton
Ice cream cost = 10 * $4
Ice cream cost = $40

Next, let's calculate the cost for frozen yoghurt:

Frozen yoghurt cost = Number of cartons of frozen yoghurt * Cost per carton
Frozen yoghurt cost = 4 * $1
Frozen yoghurt cost = $4

Now, let's find out how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt:

Difference in cost = Ice cream cost - Frozen yoghurt cost
Difference in cost = $40 - $4
Difference in cost = $36

So, Caleb spent $36 more on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt.
