#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####

system
To find the number of girls, we first add the number of boys and girls in each van: 60+28 = 88 students.
We then multiply the total number of students by the number of vans: 88*5 = 440 students.
Finally, we divide the total number of students, 440, by the number of vans, 5, to find how many van fulls of students there are: 440/5 = 88 full vans.
Since 88 full vans means 88 vans full of students and there are no extra students, the answer is 88 girls in each van, which gives us 88*60=5280 total girls.

#### GENERATION 9 RESPONSE ####

system
Total number of students transported by the vans = number of vans × students per van = 5 × 28 = 140 students.
Let the number of girls be x.
So, the total number of girls in the vans = number of boys in the vans + number of girls in the vans = 60 + x = total number of students = 140.
So, 140 - 60 = 80 students are girls.
Therefore, the number of girls in the school = 80.

To find the number of girls, we first need to calculate the total number of students that can be transported by the five coaster vans. Since each van carries 28 students, the total number of students is 28 * 5 = 140. The number of boys is 60, so the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students. Therefore, the number of girls is 140 - 60 = 80.
