###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine the number of domestic wine bottles. Since there are half as many domestic wine bottles as imported wine, we can calculate it as follows:

\[
\text{Number of domestic wine bottles} = \frac{2400}{2} = 1200
\]

So, total number of bottles in the cellar includes imported and domestic wine:

\[
2400 + 1200 = 3600
\]

Next, we calculate one-third of all wine bottles since half the wine will be consumed:

\[
\frac{3600}{3} = 1200
\]

Finally, the remaining number of bottles in his cellar can be obtained by subtracting the consumed portion from the total number of bottles:

\[
3600 - 1200 = 2400
\]

Therefore, the number of bottles that will remain in Jose's cellar is 2400.

First, we need to determine the number of bottles of domestic wine Jose has in his cellar. We know that there are 2400 bottles of imported wine and half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine. Therefore, the number of bottles of domestic wine is \( 2400 / 2 = 1200 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles of wine Jose has. This is the sum of the imported and domestic wine bottles: \( 2400 + 1200 = 3600 \).

When Jose holds the party, the guests drink one-third of all his wine. So, the number of bottles drunk is \( 3600 / 3 = 1200 \).

Finally, the number of bottles that remain in his cellar is the total number of bottles minus the number of bottles drunk: \( 3600 - 1200 = 2400 \).

First, we need to determine the number of bottles of domestic wine Jose has. According to the problem, Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine. Since he has 2400 bottles of imported wine, he has:
\[
\frac{2400}{2} = 1200 \text{ bottles of domestic wine}
\]

Next, we add the number of imported wine and domestic wine bottles to find the total number of bottles Jose has initially:
\[
2400 \text{ (imported)} + 1200 \text{ (domestic)} = 3600 \text{ bottles}
\]

Given that guests will drink one-third of all his wine, we calculate one-third of the total number of bottles:
\[
\frac{3600}{3} = 1200 \text{ bottles}
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of bottles drank from the initial total to find out how many bottles remain in the cellar:
\[
3600 \text{ (initial total)} - 1200 \text{ (bottles drank)} = 2400 \text{ bottles remaining}
\]

First, we need to find out how many bottles of domestic wine Jose has. Since he has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, we divide the number of imported wine bottles by 2: 
$$
\frac{2400}{2} = 1200
$$
Now we know Jose has 1200 bottles of domestic wine and the total number of wine bottles in his cellar is 2400 + 1200 = 3600. 
At the party, the guests drink one-third of all his wine, which is $\frac{1}{3} \times 3600 = 1200$ bottles. So, after the party, the number of wine bottles remaining in Jose's cellar is 3600 - 1200 = 2400.

First, let's find out the number of bottles of domestic wine Jose has. Since he has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, we calculate half of the imported wine, which is \( \frac{2400}{2} = 1200 \) bottles. So, Jose has 2400 bottles of imported wine and 1200 bottles of domestic wine.

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles he will have left after holding the party. Since the guests drink one-third of all his wine, we calculate one-third of the total number of wine bottles:

1. Calculate the total number of wine bottles:
\[ 2400 \text{ (imported)} + 1200 \text{ (domestic)} = 3600 \text{ bottles} \]

2. Calculate one-third of the total number of wine bottles:
\[ \frac{3600}{3} = 1200 \text{ bottles} \]

3. Subtract the number of wine bottles drunk by the guests from the total number of wine bottles:
\[ 3600 - 1200 = 2400 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Jose will have 2400 bottles of wine remaining.

First, we need to determine the number of bottles of domestic wine Jose has. Since he has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, and he has 2400 bottles of imported wine, we can calculate the number of domestic wine bottles as follows:
\[ \text{Domestic wine} = 2400 \div 2 = 1200 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of wine bottles in Jose's cellar:
\[ \text{Total wine} = \text{Imported wine} + \text{Domestic wine} = 2400 + 1200 = 3600 \text{ bottles} \]

After the guests drink one-third of all the wine, the number of bottles remaining can be calculated by subtracting one-third of the total number of bottles from the total:
\[ \text{Remaining wine} = \text{Total wine} - (\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total wine}) = 3600 - \left(\frac{1}{3} \times 3600\right) \]

Now, let's calculate this.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jose has 2400 bottles of imported wine.
2. He has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, which means he has 2400 / 2 = 1200 bottles of domestic wine.
3. The total number of bottles he has is the sum of imported and domestic wines: 2400 + 1200 = 3600 bottles.
4. If he has a party and the guests drink one-third of all his wine, he will drink 1/3 * 3600 = 1200 bottles.
5. The number of bottles remaining is: 3600 - 1200 = 2400 bottles.

Therefore, the rationale is as follows:

Jose had 3600 bottles total, and one-third of this is 1200 bottles. Taking the 3600 bottles total and subtracting the 1200 drunk means that 2400 bottles remain.

To calculate the number of domestic wine bottles, we divide the number of imported wine bottles by 2:

2400 / 2 = 1200 bottles of domestic wine

Now, we will find the total number of wine bottles by adding the imported and domestic wine bottles:

2400 imported wine bottles + 1200 domestic wine bottles = 3600 total wine bottles

If the guests drink one-third of the total wine, we calculate one-third of the total:

1/3 * 3600 bottles = 1200 bottles

Now, we will subtract the number of bottles drunk by the guests from the original total to find out how many remain:

To determine the number of bottles of wine remaining in Jose's cellar, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles of both imported and domestic wine he has.

1. **Calculate the number of imported wine bottles:**
   - Jose has 2400 bottles of imported wine.
   
2. **Calculate the number of domestic wine bottles:**
   - The number of domestic wine bottles is half the number of imported wine bottles.
   - Domestic wine bottles = 2400 / 2 = 1200 bottles.

3. **Calculate the total number of wine bottles:**
   - Total wine bottles = Import wine bottles + Domestic wine bottles
   - Total wine bottles = 2400 + 1200 = 3600 bottles.

4. **Determine the number of wine bottles consumed at the party:**
   - The guests drink one-third of all his wine.
   - Wine consumed = 1/3 * Total wine bottles = 1/3 * 3600 = 1200 bottles.

5. **Calculate the number of wine bottles remaining:**
