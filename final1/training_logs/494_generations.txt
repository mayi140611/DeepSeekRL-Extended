To find out how many items each baggie has, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of snack.

- Pretzels: Since there are 64 pretzels, each baggie will have 64 / 16 = 4 pretzels.
- Goldfish: Since there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, there are 4 * 64 = 256 goldfish. This makes each baggie have 256 / 16 = 16 goldfish.
- Suckers: There are 32 suckers, so each baggie will have 32 / 16 = 2 suckers.

Now we add up the items in each baggie:

4 pretzels + 16 goldfish + 2 suckers = 22 items per baggie.

To find out how many items each baggie has, we first need to determine the total number of items Millie has. There are 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers. 

Calculated number of goldfish:
\( 4 \times 64 = 256 \)

So, the total number of items Millie has is:
\( 64 + 256 + 32 = 352 \)

Now, we need to divide this total by the number of kids to find out how many items each baggie will contain.

\( \frac{352}{16} = 22 \)

So, each baggie will have 22 items.

To determine how many items each baggie will have, we first need to find the total number of items and then divide by the number of kids in the class.

1. Calculate the total number of goldfish:
   - Since there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, and there are 64 pretzels, the number of goldfish is \(4 \times 64 = 256\).

2. Calculate the total number of items:
   - The total number of items is the sum of the pretzels, goldfish, and suckers.
   - Total items = 64 (pretzels) + 256 (goldfish) + 32 (suckers) = 352 items.

3. Divide the total number of items by the number of kids in the class:
   - Each baggie will have \(352 \div 16 = 22\) items.

So, each baggie will have 22 items.

First, we need to calculate the total number of each snack item.

Mille has four times as many goldfish as pretzels. So, the number of goldfish is:
\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \]

Now, we have the pretzels, goldfish, and suckers:

Pretzels: 64
Goldfish: 256
Suckers: 32

Next, we calculate the total number of snacks by adding them together:
\[ 64 + 256 + 32 = 352 \]

Mille is making baggies for 16 kids. To divide the snacks equally among the baggies, we divide the total number of snacks by the number of kids:
\[ 352 \div 16 = 22 \]

So, each baggie has 22 items.

To determine how many items each baggie will have, we need to calculate the total number of each type of snack and then divide by the number of kids.

First, let's calculate the number of goldfish:
- Millie has 4 times as many goldfish as pretzels.
- She has 64 pretzels.
- Therefore, the number of goldfish is \(4 \times 64 = 256\) goldfish.

Next, let's calculate the number of suckers:
- She has 32 suckers.

Now, let's find the total number of each type of snack:
- Pretzels: 64
- Goldfish: 256
- Suckers: 32

To find the total number of snacks, we add these quantities together:
\[ 64 + 256 + 32 = 352 \]

Mille needs to divide these 352 snacks equally among 16 kids.

To find out how many snacks each kid will get, we divide the total number of snacks by the number of kids:
\[ \frac{352}{16} = 22 \]

Therefore, each baggie will have 22 items.

To determine how many items each baggie has, we first need to calculate the total number of each treat that Millie has:

- Pretzels: 64
- Goldfish: 4 times as many as pretzels, so \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) goldfish
- Suckers: 32

Next, we add these amounts together to get the total number of items:

\[ 64 \text{ (pretzels)} + 256 \text{ (goldfish)} + 32 \text{ (suckers)} = 352 \]

Now, we divide the total number of items by the number of kids to find out how many items each baggie will have:

\( \frac{352 \text{ items}}{16 \text{ kids}} = 22 \text{ items per baggie} \)

Therefore, each baggie has 22 items.

To find out how many items each baggie has, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of snack. The problem tells us that there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels. Since there are 64 pretzels, the number of goldfish is \(4 \times 64 = 256\).

Adding the number of pretzels and goldfish together, we have \(64 + 256 = 320\) snacks. These 320 snacks are to be divided equally among 16 kids. So, we divide the total number of snacks by the number of kids: \(320 \div 16 = 20\).

Therefore, each baggie has 20 items.

To determine how many items each baggie has, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of snack that Millie is dividing.

1. **Pretzels**: Millie has 64 pretzels. She is dividing them into 16 baggies. 

    \[
    \text{Pretzels per baggie} = \frac{64}{16} = 4
    \]

2. **Goldfish**: Millie has four times as many goldfish as pretzels. So, we calculate:

    \[
    \text{Goldfish} = 4 \times \text{Pretzels} = 4 \times 64 = 256
    \]

    Since we need to divide these equally among 16 baggies:

    \[
    \text{Goldfish per baggie} = \frac{256}{16} = 16
    \]

3. **Suckers**: Millie has 32 suckers. She is dividing them into 16 baggies.

    \[
    \text{Suckers per baggie} = \frac{32}{16} = 2
    \]

Now we add up the items in each baggie:

\[
\text{Items per baggie} = \text{Pretzels per baggie} + \text{Goldfish per baggie} + \text{Suckers per baggie} = 4 + 16 + 2 = 22
\]

Therefore, each baggie has **22 items**.

To determine how many items each baggie has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of goldfish.
2. Sum the number of pretzels, goldfish, and suckers.
3. Divide the total by the number of kids to find out how many items each baggie has.

First, let's find out how many goldfish there are:
- Since Mille has four times as many goldfish as pretzels, she has \(4 \times 64 = 256\) goldfish.

Next, we add up all the items:
- Pretzels: 64
- Goldfish: 256
- Suckers: 32

So the total number of items is \(64 + 256 + 32 = 352\).

Now, we divide the total number of items by the number of kids:
- Total items: 352
- Number of kids: 16

So, each baggie has \(352 \div 16 = 22\) items.

To find out how many items each baggie has, we first need to calculate the total number of snacks (pretzels, goldfish, and suckers) being divided among the 16 kids.

The number of goldfish is four times the number of pretzels, so:
Goldfish = 4 * Pretzels = 4 * 64 = 256 goldfish

The total number of snacks is:
Total snacks = Pretzels + Goldfish + Suckers
Total snacks = 64 + 256 + 32 = 352 snacks

Now, to find out how many items each baggie has, we divide the total number of snacks by the number of kids:
Snacks per baggie = Total snacks / Number of kids
Snacks per baggie = 352 / 16 = 22

So, each baggie contains 22 items.
