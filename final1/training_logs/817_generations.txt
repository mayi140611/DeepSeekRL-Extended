<reasoning>
We start by determining how many pickle slices Tammy can eat. Since she can eat twice as much as Sammy, and Sammy eats 15 pickle slices, Tammy eats \(2 \times 15 = 30\) pickle slices.

Next, we calculate how many pickle slices Ron eats. Ron eats 20% fewer pickle slices than Tammy. To find 20% of Tammy's total, we calculate \(0.20 \times 30 = 6\) pickle slices, which is the amount of pizza slices Ron eats less than Tammy's total. This means Ron eats \(30 - 6 = 24\) pickle slices.

Therefore, Ron eats 24 pickle slices.

To determine how many pickle slices Ron eats, we first need to find out how many Tammy can eat. 

1. Sammy can eat 15 pickle slices.
2. Tammy can eat twice as much as Sammy, so:
   \[
   \text{Tammy} = 2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, Tammy can eat 30 pickle slices.

3. Ron eats 20% fewer pickles slices than Tammy. To find out how many pickles Ron eats:
   \[
   \text{Ron's slices} = 30 \times (1 - 0.20) = 30 \times 0.80 = 24
   \]

Therefore, Ron eats 24 pickle slices.

system
<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of pickle slices that Tammy can eat as \( T \).

According to the problem:
- Sammy can eat 15 pickle slices.
- Tammy can eat twice as much as Sammy, so \( T = 2 \times 15 \).

Sammy's twin sister Tammy:
\[ T = 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Ron eats 20% fewer pickle slices than Tammy, or equivalently, he eats 80% of the pickle slices Tammy eats. Therefore, we need to calculate 80% of Tammy's total pickle slices.

\[ \text{Ron's slices} = T \times 0.80 = 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \]

So, Ron eats 24 pickle slices.

First, let's calculate how many pickle slices Tammy can eat. Since Tammy can eat twice as much as Sammy, we calculate:
\[ \text{Tammy's consumption} = 2 \times \text{Sammy's consumption} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \] pickle slices.

Next, we need to determine Ron's consumption. Ron eats 20% fewer pickle slices than Tammy, which means he eats:
\[ \text{Ron's consumption} = \text{Tammy's consumption} - 0.2 \times \text{Tammy's consumption} = 30 - 0.2 \times 30 = 30 - 6 = 24 \] pickle slices.

Therefore, Ron eats 24 pickle slices.

To determine how many pickle slices Ron eats, we first need to calculate how many Tammy can eat, since Tammy eats twice as much as Sammy. Then we will calculate how many pickles slices Ron eats, which is 20% fewer than Tammy's total.

1. Sammy can eat 15 pickle slices.
2. Tammy can eat twice as much as Sammy, so Tammy eats \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) pickle slices.
3. Ron eats 20% fewer pickles slices than Tammy. This means Ron eats \( 30 - (0.20 \times 30) = 30 - 6 = 24 \) pickle slices.

So, Ron eats 24 pickle slices.

To determine how many pickle slices Ron eats, we need to calculate the number of pickle slices each sister can eat based on Sammy's consumption.

1. Calculate Tammy's pickle slice consumption:
   Tammy eats twice as much as Sammy.
   Tammy's consumption = 2 × Sammy's consumption = 2 × 15 = 30 pickle slices.

2. Calculate Ron's pickle slice consumption:
   Ron eats 20% fewer pickle slices than Tammy.
   Ron's consumption = Tammy's consumption - 20% of Tammy's consumption = 30 - 0.20 × 30 = 30 - 6 = 24 pickle slices.

Therefore, Ron eats 24 pickle slices.

   \[
   15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ pickle slices}
   \]

2. Determine how many pickle slices Ron eats. Ron eats 20% fewer pickles slices than Tammy. This means he eats 100% - 20% = 80% of Tammy's consumption. To find 80% of 30, we calculate:
   \[
   30 \times 0.8 = 24 \text{ pickle slices}

\[ \text{Tammy's consumption} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ pickle slices} \]

\[ \text{20% of Tammy's consumption} = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ pickle slices} \]

Now, subtract this amount from Tammy's total consumption to find out how many Ron eats:

\[ \text{Ron's consumption} = \text{Tammy's consumption} - \text{20% of Tammy's consumption} \]
\[ \text{Ron's consumption} = 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ pickle slices} \]
