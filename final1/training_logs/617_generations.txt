system
To calculate how much Harry earns in a week, we first determine the total number of dogs he walks across all days:

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, he walks 7 dogs each day for 3 days, so \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dogs.
- On Tuesday, he walks 12 dogs.
- On Thursday, he walks 9 dogs.

Adding these up:
\[21 + 12 + 9 = 42\]
So, Harry walks 42 dogs in a week.

Given that he is paid $5 for each dog he walks, we calculate his total earnings:
\[42 \times 5 = 210\]

Therefore, Harry earns $210 in a week.

To determine how much Harry earns in a week, we need to follow these steps:

First, let's calculate the total number of dogs Harry walks in a day:
- Monday: 7 dogs
- Tuesday: 12 dogs
- Wednesday: 7 dogs
- Thursday: 9 dogs
- Friday: 7 dogs

Total dogs walked per day = 7 + 12 + 7 + 9 + 7 = 42 dogs

Next, we find out how many dogs Harry walks in a week by multiplying the number of dogs he walks per day by the number of days:
42 dogs/day * 5 days/week = 210 dogs/week

Harry is paid $5 for each dog he walks, so we calculate his total earnings by multiplying the number of dogs walked in a week by the payment per dog:
210 dogs * $5/dog = $1050

Therefore, Harry earns $1050 in a week.

To calculate Harry's total earnings for the week, we need to consider how many dogs he walks on each day and multiply that by his pay rate.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Harry walks 7 dogs each day, so for those 3 days, he walks:
\[ 7 \text{ dogs/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ dogs} \]

On Tuesday, he walks 12 dogs.

On Thursday, he walks 9 dogs.

Adding these up gives the total number of dogs he walks in the week:
\[ 21 \text{ dogs} + 12 \text{ dogs} + 9 \text{ dogs} = 42 \text{ dogs} \]

Since he is paid $5 for each dog, his total earnings for the week are:
\[ 42 \text{ dogs} \times 5 \text{ dollars/dog} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Harry earns $210 in a week.

To find out how much Harry earns in a week, we need to first calculate the number of dogs he walks each day and then multiply that by the payment rate.

From the information provided:

- On Monday, Harry walks 7 dogs.
- On Tuesday, he walks 12 dogs.
- On Wednesday, he walks 7 dogs.
- On Thursday, he walks 9 dogs.
- On Friday, he walks 7 dogs.

Now, we'll add up all the dogs he walks each day:

7 dogs (Monday) + 12 dogs (Tuesday) + 7 dogs (Wednesday) + 9 dogs (Thursday) + 7 dogs (Friday) = 42 dogs

Harry earns $5 for each dog he walks, so his total earnings for the week are:

42 dogs * $5/dog = $210

Therefore, Harry earns $210 in a week.

To determine how much Harry earns in a week, we need to calculate the total number of dogs he walks in a week and then multiply that by his hourly rate of $5 per dog.

First, let's calculate the total number of dogs walked during Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:
\[ 7 \text{ dogs per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ dogs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of dogs walked on Tuesday:
\[ 12 \text{ dogs} \]

And finally, let's calculate the total number of dogs walked on Thursday:
\[ 9 \text{ dogs} \]

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of dogs walked in the week:
\[ 21 + 12 + 9 = 42 \text{ dogs} \]

Since Harry is paid $5 per dog, we can now calculate his total earnings for the week by multiplying the total number of dogs by his rate:
\[ 42 \text{ dogs} \times 5 \text{ dollars per dog} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Harry earns $210 in a week.

To calculate Harry's weekly earnings, we first need to determine the total number of dogs he walks each day.

Monday: 7 dogs
Wednesday: 7 dogs
Friday: 7 dogs
Tuesday: 12 dogs
Thursday: 9 dogs

Total dogs walked in a week = 7 + 7 + 7 + 12 + 9

Calculating the total:
7 + 7 + 7 = 21
21 + 12 = 33
33 + 9 = 42 dogs

Now that we have the total number of dogs, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying the total number of dogs by the amount he is paid per dog.

Weekly earnings = 42 dogs * $5/dog

= $210

So, Harry earns $210 in a week.
