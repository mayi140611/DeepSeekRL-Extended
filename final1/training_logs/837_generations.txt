Let's denote the number of dogs Hildegard has as \( d \), and the number of cats as \( c \). According to the problem, the ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17, and the total number of pets is 189. This gives us the following equations:
\[ d \rightarrow \frac{10}{17} \times 189 = 105 \text{ dogs} \]
\[ c \rightarrow 189 - d = 84 \text{ cats} \]
If Hildegard gives 10 dogs to Janet, the number of dogs she has left is:
\[ 105 - 10 = 95 \]

1. First, let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \) and the number of cats as \( C \). According to the problem, the ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17, which means:
   \[
   \frac{D}{C} = \frac{10}{17}
   \]

2. We also know that the total number of pets is 189. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   D + C = 189
   \]

3. Since \( D \) and \( C \) are in the ratio 10:17, we can express \( D \) and \( C \) as:
   \[
   D = 10k \quad \text{and} \quad C = 17k
   \]
   for some integer \( k \).

4. Substituting these into the total pets equation:
   \[
   10k + 17k = 189
   \]
   \[
   27k = 189
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{189}{27} = 7
   \]

5. Now we can find the number of dogs \( D \):
   \[
   D = 10k = 10 \times 7 = 70
   \]

6. If Heloise gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, the number of dogs she remains with will be:
   \[
   D - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
   \]

Therefore, Heloise remains with 60 dogs altogether.

We start with the given ratio of dogs to cats being 10:17 and the total number of pets being 189. Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \) and the number of cats as \( C \). According to the ratio, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{D}{C} = \frac{10}{17} \]
This implies:
\[ 17D = 10C \]
Since the total number of pets is 189, we have:
\[ D + C = 189 \]
We need to solve these two equations simultaneously. From the ratio equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( C \):
\[ D = \frac{10}{17}C \]
Substituting this into the total pets equation gives:
\[ \frac{10}{17}C + C = 189 \]
Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{10C + 17C}{17} = 189 \]
\[ \frac{27C}{17} = 189 \]
Multiplying both sides by 17 to clear the fraction:
\[ 27C = 3193 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{3193}{27} \]
\[ C = 118 \]
Now substituting \( C = 118 \) back into the expression for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{10}{17} \times 118 \]
\[ D = 70 \]
So, initially, Heloise has 70 dogs and 118 cats. If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, the number of dogs she has left is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \) and the number of cats as \( C \). According to the problem, the ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17, and the total number of pets is 189.

The ratio \( \frac{D}{C} = \frac{10}{17} \) suggests that for every 10 dogs, there are 17 cats. We can express the number of cats in relation to the number of dogs as:

\[ C = \frac{17}{10}D \]

The total number of pets is the sum of dogs and cats:

\[ D + C = 189 \]

Substituting the expression for \( C \):

\[ D + \frac{17}{10}D = 189 \]

\[ \frac{27}{10}D = 189 \]

To find \( D \), we solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{189 \times 10}{27} \]

\[ D = 70 \]

Thus, Heloise initially has 70 dogs. After giving 10 dogs to her friend Janet, the number of dogs she remains with is:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Given the ratio of dogs to cats (10:17) and a total of 189 pets, we can set up the following proportions to find the number of dogs and cats. Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs and \( C \) represent the number of cats. We know:

\[ \frac{D}{C} = \frac{10}{17} \]
\[ D + C = 189 \]

First, express \( D \) in terms of \( C \) using the ratio:

\[ D = \frac{10}{17}C \]

Substitute this into the total equation:

\[ \frac{10}{17}C + C = 189 \]

Combine the terms over a common denominator:

\[ \frac{10C + 17C}{17} = 189 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{27C}{17} = 189 \]

Multiply both sides by 17 to solve for \( C \):

\[ 27C = 189 \times 17 \]
\[ 27C = 3213 \]
\[ C = \frac{3213}{27} \]
\[ C = 119 \]

Now substitute \( C \) back into the equation for \( D \):

\[ D = 189 - C \]
\[ D = 189 - 119 \]
\[ D = 70 \]

So, initially, Heloise has 70 dogs and 119 cats. If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, she will now have:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, Heloise remains with 60 dogs altogether.

1. **Determine the number of dogs and cats initially:**

   Given the ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17 and the total number of pets is 189, we know that the sum of the parts of the ratio (10 + 17) equals 27. Hence, each unit of the ratio represents \( \frac{189}{27} = 7 \) pets. 
   
   - Dogs: \( 10 \times 7 = 70 \)
   - Cats: \( 17 \times 7 = 119 \) 

2. **Adjust for the dogs given away:**

   If Heloise gives away 10 dogs and receives 10 dogs in return, the net change in dogs is \( 10 - 10 = 0 \).

3. **Final count of dogs:**

   The total number of dogs remain unchanged, which is 70.

Let's denote the number of dogs by \( D \) and the number of cats by \( C \). According to the problem, the ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17. Thus, we can write:

\[ \frac{D}{C} = \frac{10}{17} \]

The total number of pets is 189, so:

\[ D + C = 189 \]

We can solve for \( D \) and \( C \) using the ratio. First, express \( D \) in terms of \( C \):

\[ D = \frac{10}{17}C \]

Substitute this into the total number of pets equation:

\[ \frac{10}{17}C + C = 189 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ \left(\frac{10}{17}C + \frac{17}{17}C\right) = 189 \]
\[ \frac{27}{17}C = 189 \]

Solve for \( C \):

\[ C = 189 \times \frac{17}{27} \]
\[ C = 133 \]

Now, substitute \( C \) back into the expression for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{10}{17} \times 133 \]
\[ D = 10 \times 8 \]
\[ D = 80 \]

Heloise originally has 80 dogs and 133 cats. If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, the number of dogs she remains with is:

\[ 80 - 10 = 70 \]

So, the number of dogs she remains with is 70.

Let's denote the number of dogs as \(10x\) and the number of cats as \(17x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer.

Given that the total number of pets is 189, we can write the equation:
\[ 10x + 17x = 189 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ 27x = 189 \]
\[ x = \frac{189}{27} \]

1. The ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17. First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:

\[ 10 + 17 = 27 \]

2. Since the total number of pets is 189, we can determine the number of each type of pet by dividing the total number of pets by the total parts in the ratio and then multiplying by each part:

For dogs:

\[ 189 \div 27 \times 10 = 70 \]

For cats:

\[ 189 \div 27 \times 17 = 98 \]

So, Heloise has 70 dogs and 98 cats.

3. If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, she will remain with:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, Heloise remains with 60 dogs.

Let's denote the number of dogs Héloise has as \(10x\) and the number of cats as \(17x\), given their ratio is 10:17 and the total number of pets is 189.

From the given ratio and total number of pets, we can write the equation:
\[10x + 17x = 189\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[27x = 189\]
Dividing both sides by 27, we find:
\[x = 7\]

So, the number of dogs \(Héloise\) has is:
\[10x = 10 \times 7 = 70\]

If Héloise gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, the number of dogs she remains with is:
\[70 - 10 = 60\]

Heloise has dogs and cats in the ratio of 10:17, with the total number of pets being 189. If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, she will have only 9 dogs left along with the 17 cats which remained. We can find the original number of dogs by setting up a proportion:

$$ 10/\text{dogs} = 9/17 $$

Solve for the total number of dogs before giving 10 dogs:

$$ \text{dogs} = \frac{10 \times 17}{9} = 18.888... \approx 18 \text{ dogs} $$

Since the number of dogs must be a whole number (dogs cannot be fraction of a dog), we need to add and subtract 9 and 9 to get the total number back to 189 dogs:

$$ 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45 $$

Thus, the original number of dogs was 36.

Therefore, after giving 10 dogs to her friend Janet, Heloise remains with:

$$ 36 - 10= 26 $$

Thus, Heloise has 26 dogs left.

First, let's determine the total number of parts in the ratio of dogs to cats. The ratio is given as 10:17. The total number of parts is \(10 + 17 = 27\).

The total number of pets is 189, which corresponds to 27 parts. To find the value of one part, we calculate:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{189}{27} = 7 \]

Now, we calculate the number of dogs:
\[ \text{Number of dogs} = 10 \times 7 = 70 \]

After giving 10 dogs to Janet, the number of dogs that Heloise remains with is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

To verify the number of cats, we use the total number of pets:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 189 - 70 = 119 \]

The ratio of dogs to cats among the remaining pets is correct. Hence, after giving 10 dogs to Janet, Heloise remains with 60 dogs.

To determine how many dogs Heloise has after giving 10 dogs to Janet, we first need to find out how many dogs she originally had.
