To find out how many kilograms Anne is carrying, we need to first determine the weight of the male cat. Since the male cat is two times heavier than the female cat, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Male cat's weight = Female cat's weight × 2
Male cat's weight = 2 kg × 2
Male cat's weight = 4 kg

Now that we know the weight of both the cats, we can calculate the total weight Anne is carrying by adding their individual weights:

Total weight = Female cat's weight + Male cat's weight
Total weight = 2 kg + 4 kg
Total weight = 6 kg

So, Anne is carrying a total of 6 kilograms when she carries both cats.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the weight of the male cat. According to the problem, the male cat is two times heavier than the female cat. Since the female cat weighs 2 kilograms, the male cat weighs:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg} \times 2 = 4 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out the total weight Anne is carrying when she is carrying both the female and male cats. We do this by adding the weight of the female cat to the weight of the male cat:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 6 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. Therefore, Anne is carrying a total of 6 kilograms.

To find out how many kilograms Anne is carrying, we need to first determine the weight of the male cat, then add that to the weight of the female cat.

1. Anne's female cat weighs 2 kilograms.
2. Her male cat is two times heavier, so the male cat weighs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) kilograms.
3. Anne is carrying both the female and male cats, so she is carrying \(2 + 4 = 6\) kilograms.

Therefore, Anne is carrying 6 kilograms.

First, we need to determine the weight of the male cat. Since the male cat is two times heavier than the female cat, we can calculate its weight as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of male cat} = 2 \times \text{Weight of female cat} \]
\[ \text{Weight of male cat} = 2 \times 2 \text{ kilograms} \]
\[ \text{Weight of male cat} = 4 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, we need to find out the total weight when both the cats are carried:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of female cat} + \text{Weight of male cat} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 2 \text{ kilograms} + 4 \text{ kilograms} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 6 \text{ kilograms} \]

Therefore, Anne is carrying a total weight of 6 kilograms.

First, let's calculate the weight of the male cat. Since the male cat is two times heavier than the female cat, we multiply the female cat's weight by 2:

\[ 2 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 4 \, \text{kg} \]

Now, let's add the weights of both cats to find out how much Anne is carrying:

\[ 2 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 6 \, \text{kg} \]

So, Anne is carrying a total of 6 kilograms.

To find out how much Anne is carrying, we first need to determine the weight of her male cat, which is twice the weight of her female cat.

1 female cat = 2 kilograms.
2 male cat = 2 * 2 = 4 kilograms.

Now, we add the weights of the female and male cats to find the total weight Anne is carrying:

Total weight = weight of the female cat + weight of the male cat
Total weight = 2 + 4
Total weight = 6 kilograms.

Therefore, Anne is carrying a total of 6 kilograms.
