<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of erasers Anya has as \( A \) and the number Andrea has as \( E \). According to the problem, Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea, so we can write:

\[ A = 4E \]

Given that Andrea has 4 erasers (\( E = 4 \)), we can substitute this value into our equation to find the number of erasers Anya has:

\[ A = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

To find out how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea, we subtract the number of erasers Andrea has from the number Anya has:

\[ A - E = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Therefore, Anya has 12 more erasers than Andrea.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of erasers Andrea has as \( A \). According to the problem, Andrea has 4 erasers, so \( A = 4 \).

Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea. Therefore, If \( A = 4 \), then \( A \cdot 4 = 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \).

So, Anya has 16 erasers.

To find out how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea, we subtract the number of Andrea's erasers from Anya's erasers: \( 16 - 4 = 12 \).

Thus, Anya has 12 more erasers than Andrea.

Let's denote the number of erasers Andrea has as \( A \). According to the problem, Andrea has 4 erasers, so \( A = 4 \).

Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea, so the number of erasers Anya has is \( 4 \times A \).

Substituting the value of \( A \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \text{Anya's erasers} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

To find out how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea, we subtract the number of erasers Andrea has from the number of erasers Anya has:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Anya's erasers} - \text{Andrea's erasers} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Therefore, Anya has 12 more erasers than Andrea.

Let's start by determining how many erasers Anya has. The problem states that Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea. Since Andrea has 4 erasers, we can calculate Anya's erasers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of erasers Anya has} = 4 \times \text{Number of erasers Andrea has}
\]
\[
\text{Number of erasers Anya has} = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

So, Anya has 16 erasers. Now, we need to find out how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea. This can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Number of erasers Anya has} - \text{Number of erasers Andrea has}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 16 - 4 = 12
\]

Therefore, Anya has 12 more erasers than Andrea.

Let's start by defining the number of erasers each person has. We know that Andrea has 4 erasers. Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea, so Anya has \(4 \times 4 = 16\) erasers.

Next, we need to determine how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea. This is calculated by subtracting the number of erasers Andrea has from the number of erasers Anya has, which is \(16 - 4 = 12\).

Therefore, Anya has 12 more erasers than Andrea.

Let's start by determining how many erasers Anya has. If Andrea has 4 erasers and Anya has 4 times as many, we can multiply the number of Andrea's erasers by 4 to find the number of Anya's erasers:
\[ \text{Anya's erasers} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Now, to find out how many more erasers Anya has compared to Andrea, we subtract the number of Andrea's erasers from the number of Anya's erasers:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Anya's erasers} - \text{Andrea's erasers} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

So, Anya has 12 more erasers than Andrea.

Let the number of erasers Andrea has be denoted as $A$. According to the problem, Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea, so Let the number of erasers Anya has be denoted as $4A$.

Given that Andrea has 4 erasers, we know that $A = 4$.

Substitute the value of $A$ into the equation for Anya's erasers: $4A = 4 \times 4 = 16$.

So, we find that Anya has 16 erasers.

To find how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea, subtract the number of erasers Andrea has from the number of erasers Anya has:

$Anya's\ erasers - Andrea's\ erasers = 16 - 4 = 12$

Therefore, Anya has 12 more erasers than Andrea.

To find out how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea, we need to first determine how many erasers Anya has.

Given that Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea, and Andrea has 4 erasers, we can calculate Anya's total erasers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of erasers Anya has} = \text{Number of erasers Andrea has} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of erasers Anya has} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Now, to find out how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea, we subtract the number of erasers Andrea has from the number of erasers Anya has:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of erasers Anya has} - \text{Number of erasers Andrea has} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

First, we need to determine how many erasers Anya has. Since Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea, and Andrea has 4 erasers, Anya has \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) erasers. 

Next, to find out how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea, we subtract the number of erasers Andrea has from the number Anya has: \( 16 - 4 = 12 \).

Now, we need to check if Anya has the number 12 more than Andrea, which should be double Andrea's number. If it's double Andrea's number, then Anya has \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) erasers, but Andrea has only \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) erasers, which confirms that Anya is indeed having \( 48 - 16 = 12 \) more erasers than Andrea, as it should.

Therefore, Anya has double the number of erasers than Andrea.

Now, we need to subtract any smaller quantity, if there is one: Anya has \( 48 - 16 = 12 \) more than Andrea, which means Andrea has \( 48 - 12 = 36 \) erasers and Anya has \( 48 - 36 = 12 \) erasers more than Andrea.

Let's denote the number of erasers Andrea has as \( E \). According to the problem, Andrea has 4 erasers.

Given that Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea, we can represent the number of erasers Anya has as \( 4E \). Substituting the number of erasers Andrea has into this equation, we get:
\[ E = 4 \]
\[ 4E = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, Anya has 16 erasers.

To find out how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea, we subtract the number of erasers Andrea has from the number of erasers Anya has:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Thus, Anya has 12 more erasers than Andrea.
