system
First, let's determine the number of people Martin invited from his hometown, which is given as 5. 

Then, since he invited twice as many people from his school, the number of school-invited people is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

So, the number of people invited from his sports club:
\[ 5 + 10 = 15 \]

Next, the remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned, so the total number of people invited previously is:
\[ \frac{20}{100} \times \text{(friends + school + sports club)} = \frac{20}{100} \times (5 + 10 + 15) = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \]

The total number of people he invited to the party can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total invited} = \text{(hometown)} + \text{(school)} + \text{(sports club)} + \text{(remaining)} \]
\[ \text{Total invited} = 5 + 10 + 15 + 6 \]

Now, let's add them up:
\[ 5 + 10 + 15 + 6 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total number of people potentially coming to the party is:

1. **Identify the number of people from each group:**
   - Martin invited 5 people from his hometown.
   - He invited twice as many people from his school as from his hometown, so he invited \(2 \times 5 = 10\) people from his school.
   - He invited as many people from his sports club as the sum of people from his hometown and his school, so he invited \(5 + 10 = 15\) people from his sports club.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of people invited from the hometown, school, and sports club:**
   \[
   5 \text{ (hometown)} + 10 \text{ (school)} + 15 \text{ (sports club)} = 30 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining invitations:**
   - The remaining invitations are 20% of the total previously mentioned.
   \[
   \text{Remaining invitations} = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of people who can potentially come to the party:**
   \[
   \text{Total invitations} = 30 \text{ (from hometown, school, and sports club)} + 6 \text{ (remaining)} = 36 \text{ people}
   \]

**Conclusion:**
\[
\boxed{36}

Let's denote the number of people invited from Martin's hometown as \( H \), the number of people from his school as \( S \), and the number of people from his sports club as \( B \).

Given:
- \( H = 5 \)
- \( S = 2H \) (twice as many people from his school)
- \( B = H + S \) (as many people as from hometown and school)
- The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned.

Calculate the number of people from his school:
\[ S = 2H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Calculate the number of people from his sports club:
\[ B = H + S = 5 + 10 = 15 \]

Now, calculate the total number of people from his hometown, school, and sports club:
\[ H + S + B = 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 \]

The number of people who can potentially come to the party is 20% more than the total previously mentioned:
\[ 30 + 0.20 \times 30 = 30 \times 1.20 = 36 \]

Let's break down the information given:

1. Martin invited 5 people from his hometown.
2. He invited twice as many people from his school, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) people.
3. He invited as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and school, which is \(5 + 10 = 15\) people.
4. The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned.

Let's calculate the total number of people invited before considering the remaining invitations:

- Hometown: 5
- School: 10
- Sports club: 15

Total before considering remaining invitations: \(5 + 10 + 15 = 30\).

The remaining invitations are 20% of this total:

- Remaining invitations = 20% of 30 = \(0.2 \times 30 = 6\).

The total number of people who can potentially come to the party is the sum of those invited directly plus the remaining invitations:

- Total potential attendees \(= 30 + 6 = 36\).

First, let's define the number of invitees from each group. Let the number of people from the hometown be \( H \), the number of people from the school be \( S \), and the number of people from the sports club be \( C \).

From the given information:
- \( H = 5 \)
- \( S = 2 \times H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
- \( C = H + S = 5 + 10 = 15 \)

The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned invitees. So, the total number of invitees is \( H + S + C \).

The total previously mentioned is:
\[ H + S + C = 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 \]

Thus, 20% of the total mentioned number of invitees (30) represents the remaining number we are interested in. So, we calculate:
\[ 0.2 \times 30 = 6 \]

Now, we add this to the total mentioned number of invitees to get the total number of potential invitees:
\[ 30 + 6 = 36 \]

So, the total number of potential invitees is 36.

The number of people invited from his hometown is 5. He invited twice as many people from his school, which means 2 * 5 = 10 people. The number of people from his sports club is the sum of the hometown and school invitations, which is 5 + 10 = 15 people. The total number of people invited from his hometown, school, and sports club is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 people. The remaining invitations represent 20% of this total, which is 0.2 * 30 = 6 people.

First, let's calculate the number of people Martin invited from his school. Since he invited twice as many people from his school as from his hometown, the number of people invited from his school is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Next, let's determine the number of people invited from his sports club. The number of people invited from his sports club is the sum of the number of people invited from his hometown and his school, which is \(5 + 10 = 15\).

Now, let's calculate the number of people who potentially came to the party Martin is organizing. According to the information given, the remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned. First, we need to find the total number of people Martin invited, which includes those from the hometown, school, sports club, and those remaining invitations.

Total number of people invited = \(5 + 10 + 15 = 30\).

The remaining invitations, which are 20% of the total previously mentioned, are \(0.20 \times 30 = 6\).

So, the number of people who can potentially come to the party Martin is organizing is 30 (total invited) plus the 6 remaining invitations, which gives us \(30 + 6 = 36\).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Martin invited 5 people from his hometown.
2. He invited twice as many people from his school, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) people.
3. He invited as many people from his sports club as the sum of people from his hometown and school, which is \(5 + 10 = 15\) people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people invited from different sources:
- From hometown: 5 people
- From school: 10 people
- From the sports club: 15 people

The sum is \(5 + 10 + 15 = 30\) people.

However, Martin also has a condition where the remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned (30 people). This seems to be an error in the problem statement because the total number of people invited (30) should already account for 100% of the invited guests. Therefore, there is no need to calculate additional remaining invitations since they are accounted for in the total.

So, the total number of people who can potentially come to the party is 30.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Martin invited 5 people from his hometown.
2. He invited twice as many people from his school, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) people.
3. He invited as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and his school, which is \(5 + 10 = 15\) people.
4. The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned. So, let’s denote the total number of invitations as \(n\). The total previous invitations are \(5 + 10 + 15 = 30\) people. The remaining invitations are \(0.2n\).

We need to find the total number of people \(n\). Based on the information provided:
\[0.2n = \text{remaining invitations}\]

The remaining invitations are the total invitations minus the previously counted invitations:
\[n - 30 = \text{remaining invitations}\]

So, \(0.2n = n - 30\). Let's solve this equation to find \(n\):

\[0.2n = n - 30\]

Subtract \(0.2n\) from both sides:
\[0 = n - 30 - 0.2n\]

Combine like terms:
\[0 = 0.8n - 30\]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[30 = 0.8n\]

Divide both sides by 0.8:
\[n = \frac{30}{0.8}\]

\[n = 37.5\]

Since the number of people must be an integer, Martin can potentially invite:
\[37 + 38 = 75\]

Therefore, Martin can potentially come to the party with a total of 75 people.

First, let's denote the number of people Martin invited from his hometown as \( H \). According to the problem, \( H = 5 \).

Next, we need to determine the number of people invited from his school. The problem states that he invited twice as many people from his school as from his hometown, so the number of people invited from his school \( S \) is:
\[ S = 2 \times H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the number of people invited from his sports club. The problem states he invited as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and his school, so let's denote the number of people invited from his sports club \( CS \) as:
\[ CS = H + S = 5 + 10 = 15 \]

So far, we have:
\[ H = 5, \quad S = 10, \quad CS = 15 \]

The total number of people invited so far is:
\[ H + S + CS = 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 \]

The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned, which is:
\[ 0.2 \times (H + S + CS) = 0.2 \times 30 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of people Martin can potentially come to the party is:
