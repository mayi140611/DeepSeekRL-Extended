<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how many total uses John makes of the heating pad. He uses it 3 times a week for 2 weeks, so the total number of uses is:
\[ 3 \text{ uses/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ uses} \]

Next, to find out how much he spends per use, we divide the total cost by the total number of uses:
\[ \frac{\$30}{6 \text{ uses}} = \$5 \text{ per use} \]

To determine how much John spends on each use of the heating pad, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of uses in 2 weeks**: John uses the heating pad 3 times a week. Over 2 weeks, the total number of uses is:
   \[ 3 \text{ uses/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ uses} \]

2. **Determine the cost per use**: John bought the heating pad for $30. To find the cost per use, divide the total cost by the total number of uses:
   \[ \frac{\$30}{6 \text{ uses}} = \$5 \text{ per use} \]

Therefore, John spends $5 on each use of the heating pad.

John spends a total of $30 on the heating pad. He uses it 3 times a week for 2 weeks, so he uses it 3 * 2 = 6 times in total. To find out how much he spends on each use, we divide the total amount he spent by the number of uses. So, $30 / 6 uses = $5/use.

To find out how much John spends on each use of the heating pad, we first need to calculate the total number of times he uses the heating pad during the 2 weeks. He uses the heating pad 3 times a week, so in 2 weeks he will use it \(3 \times 2 = 6\) times.

Next, we divide the total cost of the heating pad by the number of uses to determine the cost per use. The total cost of the heating pad is $30, and he uses it 6 times. So, the cost per use is \(30 / 6 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, John spends 5 dollars on each use of the heating pad.

To find out how much John spends on each use of the heating pad, we first need to calculate the total number of times he uses it in total, and then divide the total cost by that number.

John uses the heating pad 3 times a week for 2 weeks. 

Total number of uses = 3 times/week Ã— 2 weeks = 6 times

Total cost of the heating pad = $30

Amount spent per use = Total cost / Total number of uses = $30 / 6 = $5

Therefore, John spends $5 on each use of the heating pad.

To determine how much John spends on each use of the heating pad, we first need to calculate the total cost for all the uses and then divide that by the number of uses.

1. **Calculate the total number of uses:**
   John uses the heating pad 3 times a week for 2 weeks.
   \[
   3 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ uses}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for the heating pad:**
   John buys the heating pad for $30.

3. **Calculate the cost per use:**
   To find the cost per use, divide the total cost by the total number of uses.
   \[
   \frac{\$30}{6 \text{ uses}} = \$5 \text{ per use}
   \]

Therefore, John spends \(\boxed{5}\) dollars on each use of the heating pad.

John buys a heating pad for $30. He uses it 3 times a week for 2 weeks. To find out how much he spends on each use, we need to divide the total cost of the heating pad by the number of times he uses it in the given period.

First, calculate the total number of times he uses the heating pad:
\[ \text{Total uses} = \text{Uses per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} \]
\[ \text{Total uses} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, calculate the cost per use:
\[ \text{Cost per use} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total uses}} \]
\[ \text{Cost per use} = \frac{30}{6} \]
\[ \text{Cost per use} = 5 \]

So, John spends $5 on each use of the heating pad.

To determine how much John spends on each heating pad use, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of uses: John uses the heating pad 3 times a week, and he uses it for 2 weeks. So, the total number of uses is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).
2. Divide the total cost by the total number of uses to find the cost per use. The total cost of the heating pad is $30.
   \[
   \text{Cost per use} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total number of uses}} = \frac{30}{6} = 5
   \]

So, John spends \(5\) dollars on each heating pad use.
