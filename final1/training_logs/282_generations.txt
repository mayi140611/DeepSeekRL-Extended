Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff, and Kristoff has 85 stickers. To find out how many stickers Riku has, we multiply Kristoff's number of stickers by 25.

So the calculation is: \(85 \times 25\).

Now, let's apply this calculation.

<answer>
\(85 \times 25 = 2125\)

</answer>
<reasoning>
To find the total number of stickers Riku has, we multiply Kristoff's number of stickers (85) by the factor of 25 that indicates Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff. This follows from the given condition that Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff.

To find out how many stickers Riku has, we start with the information that Kristoff has 85 stickers and Riku has 25 times more than Kristoff.

\[
