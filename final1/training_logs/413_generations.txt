###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

John drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.  The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?

system
The first drink has 12 / 2 = 6 ounces of liquid. It is 250 / 6 = 41.666667 grams of caffeine per ounce. The second drink has 2 / 2 = 1 ounce of liquid. It has 41.666667 * 3 = 125 grams of caffeine. John has 41.666667 + 125 = 166.666667 grams of caffeine. He then takes a pill that has as much caffeine as his drinks combined so he gets another 166.666667 grams. He has consumed 166.666667 * 2 = 333.333334 grams of caffeine.

The first drink has 250 grams / 12 ounces = 20.83 grams per ounce.
The second drink has 20.83 grams / 12 ounces * 3 = 52.49 grams per ounce.
The first drink is 3 * 52.49 grams = 157.47 grams.
The second drink is 157.47 grams / 12 ounces * 2 ounces = 26.46 grams.
For both drinks he consumed a total of 157.47 + 26.46 = 183.93 grams.
The caffeine pill is equal to 183.93 grams.

The first drink has 250/12 = 20.83 grams of caffeine per ounce.
So this drink was 20. 83*12 = 250 grams of caffeine.
The second drink has 250/3 * 2 = 167 grams of caffeine.
For 2 drinks combined he consumed 250+167 = 417 grams of caffeine.
The pill therefore contained 417 grams of caffeine.
So, he consumed a total of 417+417 = 834 grams of caffeine.

First, we need to calculate the caffeine content in the first drink. The first drink is 12 ounces and contains 250 grams of caffeine.

\[ \text{Caffeine per ounce of the first drink} = \frac{250 \text{ grams}}{12 \text{ ounces}} = \frac{250}{12} \text{ grams per ounce} \]

Next, we calculate the caffeine content in the second drink. The second drink is 2 ounces and is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink. Therefore, the caffeine density per ounce for the second drink is:

\[ \text{Caffeine per ounce of the second drink} = 3 \times \frac{250}{12} \text{ grams per ounce} \]

So,

\[ \text{Caffeine per ounce of the second drink} = \frac{750}{12} \text{ grams per ounce} = \frac{125}{2} \text{ grams per ounce} \]

Now we calculate the total caffeine content from the second drink:

\[ \text{Caffeine in the second drink} = 2 \text{ ounces} \times \frac{125}{2} \text{ grams per ounce} = 2 \times 62.5 = 125 \text{ grams} \]

Adding the caffeine from the first drink:

\[ \text{Total caffeine from the first drink} = 12 \text{ ounces} \times \frac{250}{12} \text{ grams per ounce} = 12 \times \frac{250}{12} = 250 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the total caffeine from both drinks:

\[ \text{Total caffeine from both drinks} = 250 + 125 = 375 \text{ grams} \]

John takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his two drinks combined, so the caffeine pill contains:

\[ \text{Caffeine in the pill} = 375 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, the total caffeine John consumed includes the caffeine from the two drinks and the caffeine pill:

\[ \text{Total caffeine consumed} = 375 \text{ grams} + 375 \text{ grams} = 750 \text{ grams} \]

First, we calculate the caffeine content in the first drink. The first drink is 12 ounces with 250 grams of caffeine.

\[ \text{Caffeine per ounce in the first drink} = \frac{250 \text{ grams}}{12 \text{ ounces}} \approx 20.83 \text{ grams per ounce} \]

So, the caffeine content in the first drink is:

\[ \text{Caffeine in the first drink} = 20.83 \text{ grams per ounce} \times 12 \text{ ounces} \approx 249.96 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the caffeine content in the second drink. The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink, and it is only 2 ounces.

\[ \text{Caffeine per ounce in the second drink} = 3 \times 20.83 \text{ grams per ounce} \approx 62.49 \text{ grams per ounce} \]

So, the caffeine content in the second drink is:

\[ \text{Caffeine in the second drink} = 62.49 \text{ grams per ounce} \times 2 \text{ ounces} = 124.98 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the caffeine from both drinks to find the total caffeine consumption:

\[ \text{Total caffeine} = 249.96 \text{ grams} + 124.98 \text{ grams} = 374.94 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, John consumed approximately 374.94 grams of caffeine.

The first drink is 250 grams of caffeine in 12 ounces. So the second is 187.5 grams of caffeine in 2 ounces. The first drink is 208.3 grams (12 ounces * 208.3/250). So the second drink is 36.8 grams (187.5 * 3). Therefore, the total amount of caffeine he takes is 245.1 grams (12 ounces * 208.3 + 2 ounces * 36.8).

The second drink is 20.8 grams / ounce * 3 = 62.4 grams of caffeine per ounce.
The two drinks total have 20.8 grams / ounce + 62.4 grams/ounce = 83 grams of caffeine.
Therefore, the pill he takes also has 83 grams of caffeine.

The total amount of caffeine consumed by John is 83 grams (first drink) + 83 grams (second drink) + 83 grams (pill) = 249 grams.

The first drink has 250 grams of caffeine in 12 ounces. So each ounce of the first drink has:

\( \frac{250 \text{ grams}}{12 \text{ ounces}} = \frac{250}{12} \text{ grams/ounce} \)

The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce, so each ounce of the second drink has:

\( 3 \times \frac{250}{12} \text{ grams/ounce} = \frac{750}{12} \text{ grams/ounce} \)

The first drink, 2 ounces, has:

\( 2 \text{ ounces} \times \frac{250}{12} \text{ grams/ounce} = \frac{500}{12} \text{ grams} \)

The second drink, 2 ounces, has:

\( 2 \text{ ounces} \times \frac{750}{12} \text{ grams/ounce} = \frac{1500}{12} \text{ grams} \)

Combining the caffeine amounts from both drinks gives:

\( \frac{500}{12} \text{ grams} + \frac{1500}{12} \text{ grams} = \frac{2000}{12} \text{ grams} \)

The caffeine pill is as much as his 2 drinks combined, which is:

\( \frac{2000}{12} \text{ grams} \)

So, John consumes:

\( \frac{2000}{12} + \frac{2000}{12} = \frac{4000}{12} \text{ grams} \)

Reducing the fraction:

\( \frac{4000}{12} = \frac{1000}{3} \text{ grams} \)

Therefore, John consumes \( \frac{1000}{3} \) grams of caffeine.

The first drink has 250 grams of caffeine per 12 ounces. The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce, meaning it has \(250 \text{ grams} \times 3 = 750 \text{ grams of caffeine per ounce}\). Since it is 2 ounces, the second drink has \(750 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 1500 \text{ grams}\) of caffeine.

The total caffeine from both drinks is \(250 \text{ grams} + 1500 \text{ grams} = 1750 \text{ grams}\).

The caffeine pill has the same amount of caffeine as the total from the 2 drinks combined, so he takes a pill with 1750 grams of caffeine.

The first drink has 250 grams of caffeine. The second drink is 2 ounces, and since it's 3 times more caffeinated per ounce, it means each ounce has \(250 \div 3 = 83. 33\) grams of caffeine. Thus, the second drink has \(2 \times 83. 33 = 166. 67\) grams of caffeine. Adding the caffeine from both drinks, John drank a total of \(250 + 166. 67 = 416. 67\) grams of caffeine. The caffeine pill he took has as much caffeine as his two drinks combined, so he consumed \(416. 67 + 416. 67 = 833. 34\) grams of caffeine.

The first drink has 250 grams of caffeine for 12 ounces. So, for 2 ounces, it has 250/6 = 41. 67 grams of caffeine.

The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only has 2 ounces. So, it has 50 grams of caffeine (41. 67 * 3 * 2 = 250).

Together, he consumed 250 + 50 = 300 grams of caffeine.

He also took a pill that had as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined. That amount is 300.
