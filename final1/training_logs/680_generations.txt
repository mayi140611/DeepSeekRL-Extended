Grace can read 200 pages in 20 hours, which means she reads at a rate of 10 pages per hour (200 pages / 20 hours = 10 pages/hour). To find out how long it would take her to finish a 250-page book, we divide the number of pages in the book by her reading speed: 250 pages / 10 pages/hour = 25 hours.

<reasoning>
Grace reads a 200-page book in 20 hours. To find out how many hours it takes to read 1 page, we use the formula \( \text{Time per page} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Total pages}} \). So, it takes her \( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{200 \text{ pages}} = 0.1 \text{ hours per page} \). To find out how long it takes to read the 250-page book, we multiply the time per page by the number of pages in the book: \( 0.1 \text{ hours/page} \times 250 \text{ pages} = 25 \text{ hours} \).

To determine how long it would take Grace to read a 250-page book, we can first find her reading rate, which is the number of pages she can read per hour. Since Grace can read 200 pages in 20 hours, her reading rate is:

\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ pages per hour} \]

Now, to find out how long it would take her to read a 250-page book at this rate, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Reading rate}} \]

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{250 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages per hour}} = 25 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take Grace 25 hours to read a 250-page book at her constant rate.

First, we determine Grace's reading rate. She can read 200 pages in 20 hours, so her reading rate is:

\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ pages per hour} \]

Next, we find out how many pages she can read in one hour. This is 10 pages per hour.

Now, for the 250-page book, we need to determine how long it will take her to read this amount of pages. Using the reading rate:

\[ \text{Time to read 250 pages} = \frac{250 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages per hour}} = 25 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take Grace 25 hours to finish reading a 250-page book at this constant rate.

To determine how long it will take Grace to read a 250-page book, we first need to calculate her reading rate. Grace can read 200 pages in 20 hours, so her reading rate is $\frac{200 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ pages per hour}$. With this rate, we can calculate the time it takes her to read a 250-page book as follows: $\frac{250 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages per hour}} = 25 \text{ hours}$.

Grace can read a 200-page book in 20 hours. We can first calculate her reading rate, which is the number of pages she can read per hour. This is done by dividing the number of pages she can read by the time it takes her to read them. \(200 \text{ pages} / 20 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ pages per hour}\).

Next, to find out how long it would take her to finish a 250-page book, we divide the total number of pages by her reading rate. \(250 \text{ pages} / 10 \text{ pages per hour} = 25 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, it would take her 25 hours to finish reading a 250-page book.

First, we need to determine Grace's reading rate. We know that she can read a 200-page book in 20 hours. Therefore, her reading rate is 200 pages / 20 hours = 10 pages per hour.

Now that we know her reading rate, we can calculate how long it would take her to finish reading a 250-page book. We can use the formula:

Time = Total pages / Reading rate

Plugging in the values:

Time = 250 pages / 10 pages per hour = 25 hours

To solve this, we first need to determine Grace's reading rate. She can read a 200-page book in 20 hours, which means her reading rate is \(200 \div 20 = 10\) pages per hour.

If she can read 10 pages per hour, we can calculate how long it would take her to read a 250-page book by dividing the number of pages by her reading rate. That is, \(250 \div 10 = 25\) hours.

So it would take her 25 hours to finish reading a 250-page book.
