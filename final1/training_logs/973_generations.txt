<reasoning>
To find the number of female worker ants, we first need to calculate the total number of worker ants. Since half of the ants are worker ants, we have:
\[
110 \times 0.5 = 55 \text{ worker ants}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the number of male worker ants. Since 20 percent of the worker ants are male, we have:
\[
55 \times 0.2 = 11 \text{ male worker ants}
\]

The remaining ants are female worker ants, so we subtract the number of male worker ants from the total number of worker ants to find the number of female worker ants:
\[
55 - 11 = 44 \text{ female worker ants}
\]

So, the number of female worker ants is 44.

To find the number of female worker ants, we first need to determine the total number of worker ants. Given that half of the ants are worker ants, we have:

\[ \text{Total worker ants} = \frac{110}{2} = 55 \]

Next, we calculate the number of male worker ants. Since 20 percent of the worker ants are male, we have:

\[ \text{Male worker ants} = 0.2 \times 55 = 11 \]

To find the number of female worker ants, we subtract the number of male worker ants from the total number of worker ants:

\[ \text{Female worker ants} = 55 - 11 = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 female worker ants.

To determine the number of female worker ants, we first need to find the number of worker ants in Stephen's ant farm.

Given that half of the ants are worker ants:
- Number of worker ants = \( \frac{110}{2} = 55 \) worker ants.

Next, we know that 20 percent of these worker ants are male. So, we calculate the number of male worker ants:
- Number of male worker ants = \( 55 \times \frac{20}{100} = 11 \) male worker ants.

To find the number of female worker ants, we subtract the number of male worker ants from the total number of worker ants:
- Number of female worker ants = \( 55 - 11 = 44 \).

Therefore, there are 44 female worker ants in Stephen's ant farm.

To determine the number of female worker ants, we first need to find the number of worker ants. Given that half of the ants are worker ants, we calculate the number of worker ants as follows:

\[
\text{Number of worker ants} = \frac{110}{2} = 55

Next, we need to find out how many of these worker ants are male. Since 20 percent of the worker ants are male, we calculate the number of male worker ants as follows:

\[
\text{Number of male worker ants} = 55 \times 0.20 = 11
\]

Finally, to find the number of female worker ants, we subtract the number of male worker ants from the total number of worker ants:

\[
\text{Number of female worker ants} = 55 - 11 = 44
\]

So, there are 44 female worker ants.

To find the number of female worker ants, we need to first determine the number of worker ants, which is half of the total ants. This gives us 110/2 = 55 worker ants.

Next, we are told that 20 percent of the worker ants are male. To find the number of male worker ants, we calculate 20% of 55, which is 11.

The remaining 80 percent of the worker ants are female. To find the number of female worker ants, we calculate 80% of 55, which is 44.

Therefore, there are 44 female worker ants.

To find the number of female worker ants, we'll first need to calculate the total number of worker ants. Since half of the ants are worker ants, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Total worker ants} = \frac{110}{2} = 55 \]

Next, we know that 20 percent of these worker ants are male. To find the number of male worker ants, we can multiply the total number of worker ants by the percentage that are male:

\[ \text{Male worker ants} = 55 \times \frac{20}{100} = 11 \]

To find the number of female worker ants, we subtract the male worker ants from the total number of worker ants:

\[ \text{Female worker ants} = 55 - 11 = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 female worker ants in Stephen's ant farm.

To find the number of female worker ants, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the number of worker ants. Since half of the ants are worker ants, there are 110 / 2 = 55 worker ants.
2. Next, determine the number of male worker ants. Since 20% of the worker ants are male, there are 0.20 * 55 = 11 male worker ants.
3. Finally, subtract the number of male worker ants from the total number of worker ants to get the number of female worker ants: 55 - 11 = 44.

Therefore, there are 44 female worker ants.

To find the number of female worker ants, we first need to calculate the total number of worker ants. Since half of the ants are worker ants, we have 110 ants / 2 = 55 worker ants.

Next, since 20 percent of these worker ants are male, we can calculate the number of male worker ants by taking 20 percent of 55. This gives us 55 worker ants * 0.20 = 11 male worker ants.

Finally, we can find the number of female worker ants by subtracting the number of male worker ants from the total number of worker ants. So, 55 worker ants - 11 male worker ants = 44 female worker ants.

To determine the number of female worker ants, we start by identifying the total number of worker ants. Since half of the 110 ants are worker ants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of worker ants} = \frac{110}{2} = 55 \]

Next, we need to find the number of male worker ants. Since 20 percent of the worker ants are male:

\[ \text{Number of male worker ants} = \frac{20}{100} \times 55 = 11 \]

To find the number of female worker ants, we subtract the number of male worker ants from the total number of worker ants:

To find the number of female worker ants, we first need to determine the number of worker ants and then the number of male worker ants.

Given that Stephen has 110 ants in total, half of the ants are worker ants. So, the number of worker ants is:
\[ \frac{110}{2} = 55 \]

Next, we know that 20 percent of the worker ants are male. To find the number of male worker ants, we calculate 20 percent of 55:
\[ \frac{20}{100} \times 55 = 0.2 \times 55 = 11 \]

The number of female worker ants is the total number of worker ants minus the number of male worker ants:
\[ 55 - 11 = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 female worker ants.

To find the number of female worker ants, we first need to determine the total number of worker ants and then subtract the number of male worker ants.

1. First, let's determine the total number of worker ants:
   Total ants = 110
   Worker ants = Half of total ants = 110 / 2 = 55

2. Next, let's determine the number of male worker ants:
   Male worker ants = 20 percent of worker ants = 0.20 * 55 = 11

3. Now, we can calculate the number of female worker ants by subtracting the number of male worker ants from the total number of worker ants:
   Female worker ants = Worker ants - Male worker ants
                     = 55 - 11 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 female worker ants.
