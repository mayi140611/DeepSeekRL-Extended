To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Yolanda has traveled before her husband starts driving and then calculate how long it takes for her husband to catch up to her.

1. Yolanda leaves home at 7:00 AM and rides her bike at a speed of 20 miles per hour.
2. Her husband realizes she forgot her lunch 15 minutes later, so he starts driving at 7:15 AM.
3. The distance Yolanda covers in 15 minutes (0.25 hours) at 20 mph is:
\[ \text{Distance Yolanda travels} = 20 \, \text{mph} \times 0.25 \, \text{hours} = 5 \, \text{miles} \]
4. Let \( t \) be the time in hours it takes for Yolanda's husband to catch her after he starts driving.
5. In \( t \) hours, Yolanda would have traveled an additional distance of \( 20t \) miles (since her speed is still 20 mph).
6. Her husband travels at 40 mph, so he covers a distance of \( 40t \) miles within the same time \( t \) hours.
7. Since Yolanda is ahead by 5 miles initially and needs to catch up, we set up the equation:
\[ 20t + 5 = 40t \]
8. Solving for \( t \):
\[ 20t + 5 = 40t \]
\[ 5 = 40t - 20t \]
\[ 5 = 20t \]
\[ t = \frac{5}{20} \text{ hours} \]
\[ t = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} \]
9. Converting \( \frac{1}{4} \) hours to minutes:
\[ t = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Yolanda's husband 15 minutes to catch up to her after she leaves home.

First, we need to calculate how far Yolanda has traveled in the 15 minutes before her husband starts driving. Yolanda's speed is 20 miles per hour, so in 15 minutes (which is 0.25 hours), she travels:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.25 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ miles} \]

Yolanda's husband leaves 15 minutes later, so when he starts driving, Yolanda is already 5 miles ahead. Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to catch up to her.

Let \( t \) be the time in hours (or minutes converted to hours) it takes for her husband to catch Yolanda. During this \( t \) hours, Yolanda would have traveled an additional \( 40t \) miles (since her husband's speed is 40 mph), and she would also have traveled \( 20t \) miles. Since she is still behind, the distance she is behind can be expressed as:
\[ 40t - 20t - 5 = 20t - 5 \]
This distance must equal the distance her husband travels in \( t \) hours:
\[ 40t = 20t - 5 \]

Solving this equation for \( t \):
\[ 40t - 20t = -5 \]
\[ 20t = 5 \]
\[ t = \frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} \]

Since \( t = \frac{1}{4} \) hours and there are 60 minutes in an hour, this time is equivalent to:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Yolanda's husband 15 minutes to catch up to her.

First, let's calculate how far Yolanda has traveled before her husband starts his journey. Yolanda rides her bike at 20 miles per hour, so in 15 minutes (which is 15/60 = 1/4 hour), she will have traveled:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 20 mph × 1/4 hour = 5 miles

Now, let's determine the head start that Yolanda gives her husband. After 7:00 AM, Yolanda has traveled 5 miles by her husband's time.

When her husband starts driving, Yolanda has been riding for 15/60 = 1/4 hour. The remaining distance she needs to cover is:

Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Head Start Distance
Remaining Distance = 20 miles - 5 miles = 15 miles

Now, we need to calculate how long it will take her husband to catch up to Yolanda. Since his speed is 40 mph and Yolanda's speed is 20 mph, his relative speed is:

Relative Speed = Husband's Speed - Yolanda's Speed
Relative Speed = 40 mph - 20 mph = 20 mph

Now, we can use the formula Distance = Speed × Time to find out the time it takes for him to catch Yolanda. We know that the remaining distance (15 miles) and his relative speed (20 mph) are:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 15 miles / 20 mph = 3/4 hour

To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60:

Time = 3/4 hour × 60 minutes/hour = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Yolanda's husband 45 minutes to catch her.

To determine how long it will take Yolanda's husband to catch Yolanda, we need to calculate the head start Yolanda has, and then figure out how long it takes for the husband to close that gap at his faster speed.

First, we calculate the distance Yolanda covers in the 15 minutes before her husband starts driving. Yolanda's speed is 20 miles per hour, which is equivalent to 1 mile per 3 minutes. In 15 minutes, she covers:

\[
15 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{3 \text{ minutes}} = 5 \text{ miles}
\]

So, Yolanda starts 5 miles behind when her husband begins driving.

Next, we calculate how long it takes for the husband to close this 5-mile gap at his speed of 40 miles per hour. The time it takes to close the gap is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{5 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.125 \text{ hours}
\]

We convert 0.125 hours into minutes:

\[
0.125 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 7.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take 7.5 minutes for Yolanda's husband to catch her.

To solve this problem, we'll first need to determine the distance Yolanda has already traveled before her husband starts driving. We know that Yolanda leaves at 7:00 AM and her husband waits for 15 minutes, so at 7:15 AM, Yolanda has already traveled for 15 minutes at 20 miles per hour.

First, we calculate the distance Yolanda has traveled in 15 minutes:
\[ \text{Distance}_Y = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{15}{60} \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_Y = 20 \times 0.25 \]
\[ \text{Distance}_Y = 5 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we note the time it takes for Yolanda's husband to catch her, which is the same as the time Yolanda has traveled before his arrival. Given that Yolanda travels 5 miles before her husband starts driving, it will take 5 minutes for him to catch up with Yolanda (since Yolanda's speed is 20 miles per hour and there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Therefore, the time for him to catch up is 5 minutes.

Yolanda leaves home at 7:00 AM and is riding her bike at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Her husband realizes this delay and starts driving his car at 40 miles per hour to catch up to her. 

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how far Yolanda has traveled before her husband starts driving. The time difference is \( \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \) hours or 15 minutes.

Using the distance formula \( distance = rate \times time \), Yolanda travels \( 20 \text{ mph} \times 0.25 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ miles} \) before her husband starts driving.

Now, both Yolanda and her husband are now traveling at the same rate of 40 mph, except that Yolanda has a 5 mile head start. We need to find out how long it takes for her husband to cover this 5 mile lead at 40 mph.

Let \( t \) be the time in hours that it takes for her husband to catch up. Then,

\[ 40t = 5 \]
\[ t = \frac{5}{40} \]
\[ t = 0.125 \text{ hours} \]
\[ t \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Her husband 8 minutes to catch Yolanda.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Yolanda has traveled by the time her husband starts driving. Then we need to find out how long it takes for her husband to catch up to her.

1. Yolanda leaves home at 7:00 AM. Her husband starts driving at 7:15 AM. This means that by 7:15 AM, Yolanda has already traveled for 15 minutes, which is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.
2. Yolanda's speed is 20 miles per hour, and in 0.25 hours, she would have traveled 20 * 0.25 = 5 miles. So, by 7:15 AM, Yolanda is 5 miles away from home.
3. Her husband drives at 40 miles per hour and starts 0.25 hours earlier. We need to determine how long it will take for him to travel the 5 miles at this speed.
4. The time for her husband to travel 5 miles at 40 miles per hour is 5 / 40 hours. Converting this to minutes: (5 / 40) * 60 = 0.125 * 60 = 7.5 minutes.
5. Since the husband starts driving at 7:15 AM, we need to add 7.5 minutes to this time, totaling 7:22.5 AM for him to catch up to Yolanda. This means it takes 7.5 minutes for his husband to catch Yolanda.

Yolanda leaves home at 7:00 AM and her husband leaves 15 minutes later at 7:15 AM. Yolanda's husband needs to cover the same distance as Yolanda but at a faster speed. 

First, we need to find the distance Yolanda has covered in the 15 minutes before her husband starts. 

Yolanda's speed is 20 miles per hour, so in 15 minutes (which is a quarter of an hour), she covers:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{15}{60} \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ miles} \]

Let's denote \( d \) as the distance Yolanda travels from 7:00 AM to 7:15 AM. Therefore, the remaining distance she covers after her husband starts is \( d - 5 \) miles.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Yolanda's husband to cover \( d - 5 \) miles at a speed of 40 miles per hour. We can set up the following equation to find the time \( t \) in hours, where \( t \) is the time in hours after his husband starts driving:
\[ 40 \text{ mph} \times t = d - 5 \]

Substitute \( d \) with \( 40t + 5 \) (since \( d = 40t \) is the distance covered by Yolanda's husband driving for \( t \) hours at 40 mph):
\[ 40t + 5 = 40t - 5 \]
\[ 5 = -5 \]
This means that \( t = 5/4 = 1.25 \) hours.

Now, we convert this time into minutes:
\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, it will take Yolanda's husband 75 minutes to catch up to her.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Yolanda has already traveled before her husband starts driving and then calculate the time it takes for her husband to catch up to her.

First, let's calculate the distance Yolanda travels in the 15 minutes before her husband starts driving. We convert 15 minutes to hours: \(15 \text{ minutes} = 15 \times \frac{1}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours}\).

The distance Yolanda covers in this time is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ mph} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ miles}
\]

After Yolanda leaves home, her husband starts driving. Yolanda continues to travel at 20 miles per hour. The relative speed at which her husband is catching up to her is the difference in their speeds, which is:
\[
\text{Relative Speed} = 40 \text{ mph} - 20 \text{ mph} = 20 \text{ mph}
\]

Since Yolanda is 5 miles ahead, it will take her husband \( \frac{5 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ mph}} = 0.25 \text{ hours} \) to catch up to her.

Finally, we need to convert this time into minutes:
\[
0.25 \text{ hours} = 0.25 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, her husband will catch up to her in 15 minutes.

Once her husband starts driving, the combined speed is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) miles per hour. Since Yolanda is now 5 miles behind, we need to find the time \( t \) it takes for her husband to close this distance at 60 miles per hour.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time it takes for Yolanda to cover the same distance that her husband covers in catching up to her.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Yolanda to travel the distance alone until her husband leaves:
- Yolanda's speed: 20 miles per hour
- Distance covered in 15 minutes (which is 1/4 hour) = \( 20 \text{ mph} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ hour} = 5 \text{ miles} \)

So, she has already covered 5 miles by the time her husband leaves.

Next, we determine how long it will take for Yolanda's husband to cover the remaining 5 miles.

Since Yolanda's husband is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour:
- Time to cover the remaining 5 miles = \( \frac{5 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ mph}} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} \)

\[ = \frac{5 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ mph}} \times \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} \]

\[ = \frac{5 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ mph}} \times 1 \text{ hour} \]

\[ = 1.25 \text{ hours} \]

\[ = 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} \]

\[ = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

To determine the time it takes for Yolanda's husband to catch her, we need to calculate their relative speed and the head start Yolanda has. Yolanda leaves 15 minutes before her husband starts driving.

Yolanda's speed = 20 miles per hour
Her husband's speed = 40 miles per hour

Relative speed = Husband's speed - Yolanda's speed
Relative speed = 40 mph - 20 mph = 20 mph
This means Yolanda's husband is closing the gap between them at a rate of 20 miles per hour.

The head start Yolanda has is 15 minutes, which is 15/60 = 0.25 hours or 15/60 = 0.25 hours.
Since this is a 20 mph gap closing, it will take 15/60 or 0.25 hours of relative speed to close the gap.

So it will take 0.25 hours to catch Yolanda. Since we want the answer in minutes, we convert 0.25 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60. 

0.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 15 minutes.

Therefore, it will take her husband 15 minutes to catch her.

Yolanda leaves home at 7:00 AM and her husband realizes this at 7:15 AM. At 7:15 AM, her husband starts driving at 40 miles per hour.

The distance Yolanda has already traveled by 7:15 AM is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Yolanda's husband needs to cover this 30 miles + the 0 miles she has left to travel. Since Yolanda is still riding her bike at 20 miles per hour, her husband must also cover this distance while maintaining his speed of 40 miles per hour. Thus, the relative speed at which her husband is catching up to her is:
\[ 40 \text{ mph (his speed)} - 20 \text{ mph (her speed)} = 20 \text{ mph} \]

To catch up to Yolanda, her husband needs to cover this distance of 30 miles at his relative speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Time to catch up} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ mph}} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, converting 1.5 hours to minutes:

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance Yolanda has traveled by the time her husband starts driving. The time difference of 15 minutes means Yolanda has been biking for 30 minutes when her husband starts. Let's calculate this distance.

Yolanda's biking speed is 20 miles per hour. Therefore, in 30 minutes (which is half an hour), she would have traveled:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Yolanda's husband to catch her. Since he is driving at 40 miles per hour and he needs to cover the 10-mile gap, we can find the time it takes by dividing the distance by his speed:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.25 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 0.25 hours is equivalent to:

\[ \text{Distance} = 20 \text{ mph} \times \frac{15}{60} \text{ hours} = 20 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ miles} \]
So, Yolanda has been riding for 5 miles at 7:15 AM. 

Now, her husband starts driving at 7:15 AM and needs to catch up to her. To do this, he needs to cover the 5 miles that Yolanda has traveled. His speed is 40 miles per hour. Let's find out how many hours it will take him to cover these 5 miles:

We need to determine how long it takes for Yolanda's husband to catch up to her. Let's define the distance Yolanda has traveled by 7:15 AM as \( d \).

First, Yolanda rides her bike at 20 miles per hour until Yolanda's husband starts driving at 7:15 AM:
- Yolanda's head start time: 15 minutes before Yolanda's departure.
- To make up for the 15 minutes head start, her husband drives at 40 miles per hour and needs to travel \( d \) miles.

The relative speed at which Yolanda's husband is gaining on her is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) miles per hour (Yolanda's speed and the husband's speed differ by 20 miles per hour).

Using the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \):
- The time taken for the husband to cover \( d \) miles at 20 miles per hour is \( \frac{d}{20} \).

Since each mile is equivalent to 60 minutes (or 1 hour):
- The time in hours taken to cover \( d \) miles is \( \frac{d}{20} \) hours.

To convert \( \frac{d}{20} \) hours into minutes, we multiply \( \frac{d}{20} \) by 60:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{d}{20} \times 60 = 3d \]

Now, we need to determine the distance \( d \). Given that she has completed a head start of \( d \) miles by 7:15 AM, when her husband starts:
\[ d = 20 \times \frac{30}{60} = 20 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, \( d = 10 \) miles represents the head start Yolanda has over her husband.

Finally, we substitute this back into the time formula:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = 3d = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, his husband will catch up to her in 30 minutes.
