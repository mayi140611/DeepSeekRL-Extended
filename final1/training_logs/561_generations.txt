First, let's calculate the daily food consumption for the mom foster dog.
The mom eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day. 
So, the mom eats \(1.5 \times 3 = 4.5\) cups of food per day.
Next, let's calculate the daily food consumption for the puppies. There are 5 puppies, and each eats 1/2 cup of food, twice a day.
So, the puppies eat \(5 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 5\) cups of food per day.

Now, we need to find the total food consumption for the mom and the puppies over 6 days.
The mom eats 4.5 cups a day, so over 6 days, she will eat \(4.5 \times 6 = 27\) cups of food.
The puppies eat 5 cups a day, so over 6 days, they will eat \(5 \times 6 = 30\) cups of food.

Adding these together, Joyce will need \(27 + 30 = 57\) cups of food for the next 6 days.

First, we calculate the total amount of food Joy will need for the mom foster dog.

The mom foster dog eats:
\[ 1.5 \text{ cups/day} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 4.5 \text{ cups/day} \]

For 6 days, the mom will consume:
\[ 4.5 \text{ cups/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 27 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of food the puppies will consume. Each puppy eats:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/day} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 1 \text{ cup/day} \]

There are 5 puppies, so the total amount of food needed for the puppies is:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day/puppy} \times 5 \text{ puppies} = 5 \text{ cups/day} \]

Over 6 days, the puppies will consume:
\[ 5 \text{ cups/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cups} \]

To find the total amount of food needed, we add the amounts for the puppy and the mom:
\[ 27 \text{ cups} + 30 \text{ cups} = 57 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, Joy will need:

First, we need to calculate the daily food consumption for the mom dog:
\[ 1.5 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 4.5 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we calculate the daily food consumption for the puppies. Each puppy eats:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ cups/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 1 \text{ cup/day per puppy} \]

Since there are 5 puppies, the total amount of food consumed by the puppies per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ puppies} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 5 \text{ cups/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total daily food consumption for the mom dog and the puppies:
\[ 4.5 \text{ cups/day} + 5 \text{ cups/day} = 9.5 \text{ cups/day} \]

To find the total food needed for the next 6 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 6:
\[ 9.5 \text{ cups/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 57 \text{ cups} \]

So, Joy will need 57 cups of food for the next 6 days.

The mom foster dog eats 1.5 cups of food three times a day, which is a total of 1.5 * 3 = 4.5 cups of food per day.
The puppies each eat 1/2 cup of food twice a day, which is a total of (1/2) * 2 = 1 cup of food per puppy per day.
Since there are 5 puppies, they will eat 1 * 5 = 5 cups of food per day.
The mom foster dog and the puppies will eat a total of 4.5 + 5 = 9.5 cups of food per day.
Over the next 6 days, the mom foster dog and the puppies will eat a total of 9.5 * 6 = 57 cups of food.

First, let's calculate the food consumption for the mom dog in one day:
Mom dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day.
So in one day, the mom dog needs: \(1.5 \times 3 = 4.5\) cups of food.

Next, let's calculate the food consumption for the puppies in one day:
Each puppy eats 0.5 cups of food, twice a day.
So in one day, each puppy needs: \(0.5 \times 2 = 1\) cup of food.
Since there are 5 puppies, the total amount of food for the puppies in one day is: \(1 \times 5 = 5\) cups of food.

Now, let's calculate the total food consumption for the mom dog and the puppies in one day:
Total food consumption in one day = food consumption for the mom dog + food consumption for the puppies
Total food consumption in one day = \(4.5 + 5 = 9.5\) cups of food.

Finally, let's calculate the food consumption for the next 6 days:
Total food consumption for 6 days = total food consumption in one day \(\times\) number of days
Total food consumption for 6 days = \(9.5 \times 6 = 57\) cups of food.

So, Joy will need 57 cups of food for the next 6 days.

First, let's calculate the daily food consumption for the mom dog:
- The mom dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day, so her daily food requirement is \(1.5 \times 3 = 4.5\) cups.

Next, let's calculate the daily food consumption for the puppies:
- Each puppy eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) cup of food, twice a day, so each puppy's daily food requirement is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1\) cup.
- With 5 puppies, their total daily food consumption is \(1 \times 5 = 5\) cups.

Now, let's calculate the total daily food requirement for all dogs:
- The mom dog's daily food requirement is 4.5 cups plus the puppies' total daily food requirement of 5 cups, which totals \(4.5 + 5 = 9.5\) cups per day.

To find out how much food Joy will need for the next 6 days, we multiply the total daily requirement by 6:
- Total food requirement for 6 days is \(9.5 \times 6 = 57\) cups.

Therefore, Joy will need 57 cups of food for the next 6 days.

First, let's calculate the daily food consumption of the mom foster dog:
Mom dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day. So, daily consumption for the mom dog is:
\[1.5 \, \text{cups/meal} \times 3 \, \text{meals/day} = 4.5 \, \text{cups/day}\]

Next, let's calculate the daily food consumption of the puppies:
Each puppy eats 0.5 cups of food, twice a day. So, daily consumption per puppy is:
\[0.5 \, \text{cups/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 1 \, \text{cup/day}\]
Since there are 5 puppies, the total daily consumption for all the puppies is:
\[1 \, \text{cup/puppy} \times 5 \, \text{puppies} = 5 \, \text{cups/day}\]

Now, let's add the daily consumption of the mom dog and the puppies to get the total daily consumption:
\[4.5 \, \text{cups/day (mom)} + 5 \, \text{cups/day (puppies)} = 9.5 \, \text{cups/day}\]

Finally, to find out how much food Joy will need for the next 6 days, we multiply the total daily consumption by 6:

To determine how much food Joy will need for the next 6 days, we need to calculate the daily food requirement for both the mother dog and the puppies, and then multiply by 6.

First, calculate the daily food requirement for the mother dog:
- The mother dog eats 1.5 cups of food three times a day.
- Daily food for the mother dog = 1.5 cups/trip × 3 trips/day = 4.5 cups/day.

Next, calculate the daily food requirement for the puppies:
- There are 5 puppies, and each puppy eats 0.5 cups of food twice a day.
- Daily food for one puppy = 0.5 cups/trip × 2 trips/day = 1 cup/day.
- Daily food for 5 puppies = 1 cup/day × 5 puppies = 5 cups/day.

Now, combine the food requirements:
- Total daily food for the puppies = 5 cups/day.
- Total daily food for the mother dog = 4.5 cups/day.
- Total daily food needed = 4.5 cups/day (mother) + 5 cups/day (puppies) = 9.5 cups/day.

Finally, calculate the total food needed for 6 days:
- 6 days × 9.5 cups/day = 57 cups.

To determine the total amount of food needed, we need to calculate the food consumption for the mom dog and the puppies separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Mom dog:
- Eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day.
- Daily food consumption for the mom dog = 1.5 cups/meal × 3 meals/day = 4.5 cups/day.
- For 6 days, the total food consumption for the mom dog = 4.5 cups/day × 6 days = 27 cups.

2. Puppies:
- Each puppy eats 0.5 cups of food, twice a day.
- Daily food consumption for one puppy = 0.5 cups/meal × 2 meals/day = 1 cup/day.
- There are 5 puppies, so total daily food consumption for the puppies = 1 cup/day × 5 puppies = 5 cups/day.
- For 6 days, the total food consumption for the puppies = 5 cups/day × 6 days = 30 cups.

3. Total food consumption for the next 6 days:
- Total food consumption for the mom dog = 27 cups.
- Total food consumption for the puppies = 30 cups.
- Total food consumption = 27 cups + 30 cups = 57 cups.

First, let's calculate the amount of food the mom foster dog eats in one day. Since the mom eats 1.5 cups of food three times a day, the amount of food the mom eats in one day is:
\[ 1.5 \, \text{cups} \times 3 = 4.5 \, \text{cups} \]

Next, we'll calculate the amount of food the puppies eat in one day. Each puppy eats 0.5 cups of food twice a day, so each puppy eats:
\[ 0.5 \, \text{cups} \times 2 = 1 \, \text{cup} \]
There are 5 puppies, so the total amount of food the puppies eat in one day is:
\[ 1 \, \text{cup} \times 5 = 5 \, \text{cups} \]

Now we can find the total amount of food for the mom and the puppies in one day by adding the amounts together:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{cups} + 5 \, \text{cups} = 9.5 \, \text{cups} \]

Since we need this amount for six days, we multiply the daily total by 6:

Now, we sum the daily food requirements for the mom dog and the puppies:
\[ 4.5 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 9.5 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much food Joy will need for the next 6 days, we multiply the daily requirement by 6:

First, calculate how much food the mom dog eats in a day:
Mom dog eats 1.5 cups of food, 3 times a day.
1.5 cups/meal * 3 meals/day = 4.5 cups/day for the mom dog.

Next, calculate how much food the puppies eat in a day. We need to find the total for all 5 puppies:
Each puppy eats 1/2 cup of food, 2 times a day.
1/2 cup/meal * 2 meals/day = 1 cup/day per puppy.
Total food for 5 puppies = 5 puppies * 1 cup/day = 5 cups/day.

Now, add the food consumption for the mom dog and the puppies:
Total food for the next 6 days (3 days * 2 meals/day) for the mom dog:
4.5 cups/day * 3 days = 13.5 cups.

Total food for the next 6 days for all puppies:
