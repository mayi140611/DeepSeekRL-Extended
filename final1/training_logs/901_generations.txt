First, we need to determine how many 30-minute intervals are there in 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find the number of 30-minute intervals by dividing 60 by 30, which gives us 2 intervals. Therefore, in 8 hours, the machine will produce $2 \times 30 = 60$ cans of soda.

To determine how many cans of soda one machine can produce in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert 8 hours into minutes:**
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of 30-minute intervals in 480 minutes:**
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/interval} = 16 \text{ intervals}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of cans produced in 16 intervals:**
   Each interval produces 30 cans:
   \[
   16 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ cans/interval} = 480 \text{ cans}
   \]

To determine how many cans of soda one machine can produce in 8 hours, we first need to calculate the number of 30-minute intervals in 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is equal to \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes. Dividing 480 minutes by 30 gives us the number of 30-minute intervals in 8 hours.

\[480 \div 30 = 16\]

So, there are 16 intervals of 30 minutes in 8 hours. Since each interval corresponds to the production of 30 cans of soda, the total number of cans produced in 8 hours is:

\[16 \times 30 = 480\]

Therefore, one machine can produce 480 cans of soda in 8 hours.

First, we need to determine how many 30-minute intervals are in 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, then 8 hours is \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes. Dividing by 30 minutes, we get \(480 / 30 = 16\) intervals. 

Since the machine produces 30 cans of soda every 30 minutes, and considering that in each interval, it operates for 30 minutes, the machine will produce \(30 \times 16 = 480\) cans of soda in 8 hours.

Since the machine produces 30 cans every 30 minutes, we can calculate the total number of cans produced in 8 hours by dividing the total number of minutes by 30 and then multiplying by 30 cans. \[
\text{Total cans produced} = \left( \frac{480}{30} \right) \times 30

To determine how many cans of soda one machine can produce in 8 hours, we first need to understand the production rate of the machine. We know that the machine produces 30 cans every 30 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of cans produced every hour:
- In 1 hour (60 minutes), the machine produces \(30 \text{ cans} \times 2 = 60 \text{ cans}\) (2 sets of 30 cans each).

Next, we need to find out how many hours are in 8 hours:
- \(8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we can calculate the total number of cans produced in 8 hours:
- Total cans in 8 hours = Cans per hour \(\times\) 8 hours
- Total cans in 8 hours = 60 cans/hour \(\times\) 8 hours = \(60 \times 8 = 480 \text{ cans}\).

Therefore, one machine can produce 480 cans of soda in 8 hours.

To determine how many cans of soda one machine can produce in 8 hours, we first need to establish the rate at which the machine produces soda. We know that the machine produces 30 cans of soda every 30 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of 30-minute intervals in one hour:
$$\frac{60\ minutes}{30\ minutes} = 2\ intervals$$

Each interval produces 30 cans, so in one hour, the machine produces:
$$2\ intervals \times 30\ cans = 60\ cans$$

Given that we are interested in 8 hours, we can multiply the hourly production by 8:
$$60\ cans \times 8\ hours = 480\ cans$$

Therefore, one machine can produce 480 cans of soda in 8 hours.

To determine how many cans of soda one machine can produce in 8 hours, we first need to find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is equivalent to \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes. 

Next, we divide the total minutes by the interval between cans (30 minutes) to find the number of intervals in 8 hours: 
\[ \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{480}{30} = 16. \]

Then, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of cans produced per interval (30 cans):
\[ \text{Total cans} = 16 \times 30 = 480. \]

So, one machine can produce 480 cans of soda in 8 hours.

To determine how many cans of soda one machine can produce in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the number of 30-minute intervals in an hour:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Each interval is 30 minutes long.

   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per interval}} = 2 \text{ intervals per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of intervals in 8 hours:**
   - Since there are 2 intervals per hour.

   \[
   2 \text{ intervals per hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ intervals}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cans produced in 16 intervals:**
   - Each interval produces 30 cans.

   \[

First, we need to determine how many 30-minute intervals are in an 8-hour work period. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is the same as \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes. To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 480 minutes, we divide 480 by 30, which gives us \(480 / 30 = 16\) intervals.

Given that the machine produces 30 cans in each 30-minute interval, over 16 intervals, the machine will produce \(16 \times 30 = 480\) cans.

To find out how many cans of soda a machine produces in 8 hours, we first need to determine how many 30-minute intervals fit into 8 hours.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 8 hours, there are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the machine produces 30 cans every 30 minutes, we can calculate the number of 30-minute intervals in 480 minutes by dividing 480 by 30:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/interval} = 16 \text{ intervals} \]

Given that the machine produces 30 cans per interval, the total number of cans produced in 8 hours is:
\[ 16 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ cans/interval} = 480 \text{ cans} \]

So, the machine can produce 480 cans of soda in 8 hours.

First, we calculate how many 30-minute intervals there are in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Total intervals} = 8 \, \text{hours} \times 60 \, \text{minutes/hour} / 30 \, \text{minutes/interval} \]

Calculate the total number of intervals in one hour:
\[ \text{Intervals per hour} = \frac{60 \, \text{minutes}}{30 \, \text{minutes/interval}} = 2 \]

Then:
\[ \text{Total intervals in 8 hours} = 2 \, \text{intervals/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{intervals} \]

Next, since each interval produces 30 cans, we multiply the total number of intervals by the number of cans produced per interval:
\[ \text{Total cans in 8 hours} = 16 \, \text{intervals} \times 30 \, \text{cans/interval} \]

So:
\[ \text{Total cans} = 16 \times 30 = 480 \, \text{cans} \]
