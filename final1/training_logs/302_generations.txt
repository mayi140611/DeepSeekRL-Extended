###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Carrie is wrapping three birthday presents. One present needs two square feet of wrapping paper to cover. The second present needs three-quarters of that amount. The third present needs the same amount as both other presents put together. How many square feet of wrapping paper does Carrie need for all three presents?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
First, calculate the amount of wrapping paper needed for the second present:
\[ 3 \text{/4} \times 2 \text{ square feet} = 1.5 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, let \( x \) represent the amount of wrapping paper needed for the third present. The total amount needed for all three presents is:
\[ x = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Carrie needs \( 3 + 1.5 + 3.5 \) square feet of wrapping paper.

Now, calculate the total:
\[ 2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7 \text{ square feet} \]

The second present needs three-quarters of two square feet, which is \(2 \times \frac{3}{4} = 1.5\) square feet. The third present needs the sum of the other two, which is \(2 + 1.5 = 3.5\) square feet. Therefore, the total amount of wrapping paper needed is \(2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7\) square feet.

Let's calculate each present's wrapping paper needs step by step.

1. The first present needs 2 square feet of wrapping paper.

2. The second present needs three-quarters of the first present:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 2 = 1.5 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. The third present needs the same amount as both the first two combined:
   \[
   2 + 1.5 = 3.5 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Now, let's add the amount for all three presents to find the total needed:
\[
2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7 \text{ square feet}

The second present needs three-quarters of two square feet, which is \(2 \times \frac{3}{4} = 1.5\) square feet of wrapping paper.

The third present needs the sum of the wrapping paper needed for the first and second presents, which is \(2 + 1.5 = 3.5\) square feet of wrapping paper.

The total wrapping paper needed for all three presents is \(2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7\) square feet.

To find out how much wrapping paper Carrie needs for all three presents, we first need to calculate the amount required for each present.

For the first present, it needs 2 square feet of wrapping paper.

For the second present, it needs three-quarters of the amount of the first present, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 2 \).

For the third present, it needs the same amount as the other two combined, which is \( 2 + \frac{3}{4} \times 2 \).

Let's calculate these amounts:

For the second present:
\( \frac{3}{4} \times 2 = 1.5 \) square feet

For the third present:
\( 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 \) square feet

Now, let's add up all the amounts to find the total amount of wrapping paper needed:

Total wrapping paper = \( 2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7 \) square feet

So, Carrie needs 7 square feet of wrapping paper in total.

To find out how much wrapping paper Carrie needs for all three presents, let's calculate the amount of paper needed for each present step by step.

1. The first present needs 2 square feet of wrapping paper.

2. The second present needs three-quarters of the amount needed for the first present. To find this amount, we calculate:
   2 * 3/4 = 6/4 = 1.5 square feet.

3. The third present needs the same amount as both other presents put together. To find this amount, we add the amounts needed for the first and second presents:
   2 + 1.5 = 3.5 square feet.

4. To find the total amount of wrapping paper needed for all three presents, we add the amounts needed for each present:
   2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7 square feet.

Therefore, Carrie needs 7 square feet of wrapping paper for all three presents.

To find the total square feet of wrapping paper needed, we'll first calculate the amount required for each present and then sum them up.

1. For the first present, it needs 2 square feet of wrapping paper.
2. For the second present, it needs three-quarters of the first present's requirement, so it needs \( \frac{3}{4} \times 2 = 1.5 \) square feet.
3. The third present needs the sum of the first two presents, which is \( 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 \) square feet.

Adding these amounts together:
\( 2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7 \) square feet.

Therefore, Carrie needs a total of 7 square feet of wrapping paper for all three presents.

First, let's determine how much wrapping paper is needed for the first present. The first present needs 2 square feet of wrapping paper.

Next, we calculate how much wrapping paper is needed for the second present, which needs three-quarters of the amount needed for the first present. So, we compute \( \frac{3}{4} \times 2 \):
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 2 = \frac{3 \times 2}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

Now, we find out how much wrapping paper is needed for the third present, which needs the same amount as both other presents put together. We add the amounts needed for the first and second presents:
\[
2 + 1.5 = 3.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

Finally, we sum up the amounts of wrapping paper needed for all three presents:
\[
2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7 \text{ square feet}
\]

Therefore, Carrie needs 7 square feet of wrapping paper for all three presents.
