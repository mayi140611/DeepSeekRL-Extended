system
To find out how many roses Ian kept, we need to subtract the number of roses he gave away from the total number of roses he had.

Total roses Ian had = 20
Roses given to his mother = 6
Roses given to his grandmother = 9
Roses given to his sister = 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses given away:

Roses given away = 6 + 9 + 4 = 19

Now, to find out how many roses Ian kept, we subtract the number of roses given away from the total number of roses he had:

Roses Ian kept = Total roses - Roses given away
Roses Ian kept = 20 - 19 = 1

So, Ian kept 1 rose.

Ian initially had 20 roses. He gave away a total of 6 roses to his mother, 9 roses to his grandmother, and 4 roses to his sister. To find out how many roses he gave away, we add these amounts together:

\[ 6 + 9 + 4 \]

\[ = 20 \]

Thus, Ian gave away a total of 20 roses.

Given that Ian started with 20 roses and gave away 20 roses, he therefore kept the remaining roses. Since all 20 roses were given away, Ian did not keep any roses.

To find out how many roses Ian kept, we need to subtract the number of roses he gave away from the total number of roses he had.

Total roses - Roses given to mother + Roses given to grandmother + Roses given to sister
= 20 - 6 + 9 + 4

Now let's perform the calculation:

20 - 6 = 14
14 + 9 = 23
23 + 4 = 27

Ian kept 27 roses.

Ian started with 20 roses. He gave away roses to his mother, grandmother, and sister. The number of roses he gave to each person is as follows:
- To his mother: 6 roses
- To his grandmother: 9 roses
- To his sister: 4 roses

First, we add up the roses he gave away:
\[ 6 + 9 + 4 = 19 \]

Next, we subtract the total number of roses he gave away from the initial number of roses:
\[ 20 - 19 = 1 \]

So, Ian kept 1 rose.

To determine how many roses Ian kept, we need to subtract the roses he gave to his mother, grandmother, and sister from the total number of roses he originally had. 

The calculation is as follows:
- Total roses: 20
- Roses given to his mother: 6
- Roses given to his grandmother: 9
- Roses given to his sister: 4

The number of roses Ian kept can be found by subtracting the roses given away from the total number of roses:
\[ 20 - 6 - 9 - 4 = 1 \]

So, Ian kept 1 rose.

To find out how many roses Ian kept, we need to:
- Start with the total number of roses Ian had.
- Subtract the number of roses he gave to his mother.
- Subtract the number of roses he gave to his grandmother.
- Subtract the number of roses he gave to his sister.
- The result will be the number of roses Ian kept.

Calculation:
20 (total roses) - 6 (to his mother) - 9 (to his grandmother) - 4 (to his sister) = 1 (rose Ian kept).

So the calculation step by step is:
20 - 6 = 14
14 - 9 = 5
5 - 4 = 1

Therefore, Ian kept 1 rose.

To find out how many roses Ian kept, we need to subtract the roses he gave away from the total he had initially.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ian gave away:

- To his mother: 6 roses
- To his grandmother: 9 roses
- To his sister: 4 roses

The total number of roses given away is the sum of these amounts:
\[ 6 + 9 + 4 = 19 \]

Ian had 20 roses initially. Subtracting the roses he gave away from the total:
\[ 20 - 19 = 1 \]

So, Ian kept 1 rose.

To find out how many roses Ian kept, we need to subtract the number of roses he gave away from the total number of roses he had initially.

The total number of roses Ian had initially was 20.

He gave away six roses to his mother, nine roses to his grandmother, and four roses to his sister.

So, the total number of roses he gave away is:
6 + 9 + 4 = 19

The number of roses Ian kept is the total minus the number he gave away:
20 - 19 = 1

Therefore, Ian kept 1 rose.

To find out how many roses Ian kept, we can start by calculating the total number of roses he gave away. We add the roses given to his mother, grandmother, and sister:

- Roses given to his mother: 6 roses
- Roses given to his grandmother: 9 roses
- Roses given to his sister: 4 roses

Now, we add these numbers together to find the total number of roses given away:

6 roses + 9 roses + 4 roses = 19 roses

Ian started with 20 roses, so the number of roses he kept is the difference between the total number of roses he had and the total number he gave away:

20 roses - 19 roses = 1 rose

Therefore, Ian kept 1 rose.

To find out how many roses Ian kept, we need to subtract the roses he gave away from the total he originally had. We can do this by subtracting the roses given to his mother, grandmother, and sister from the total number of roses, and then finally subtracting the roses given to his grandmother from the remaining number.

The equation to solve this is: \( 20 - 6 - 9 - 4 \).
