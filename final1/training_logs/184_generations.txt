###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

After tests in California, the total number of Coronavirus cases was recorded as 2000 positive cases on a particular day. The number of cases increased by 500 on the second day, with 50 recoveries. On the third day, the total number of new cases spiked to 1500 with 200 recoveries. What's the total number of positive cases after the third day?

system
On the first day, there were 2000 positive cases.
The second day, there were 2000 + 500 = 2500 positive cases.
However, with 50 recoveries, the total number of positive cases decreased to 2500 - 50 = 2450.
On the third day, there were 2450 + 1500 = 3950 positive cases.
With 200 recoveries, the total number of positive cases decreased to 3950 - 200 = 3750.

On the 1st day, there were 2,000 new cases. On the 2nd day, the number of new cases spiked to 2,000 + 500 = 2,500.
On the 2nd day, 2,500 - 50 = 2,450 cases were left without recovery.
On the 3rd day, the number of new cases spiked to 2,450 + 1,500 = 3,950
3,950 - 200 = 3,750 cases are left without recovery after the third day.
Therefore, the total number of positive cases after the third day is 3,750 + 2,000 = 5,750.

The increase in the number of cases from the first day to the second day was 500 - 2000 = -1500
The number of positive cases increased by 500 on the second day, with 50 recoveries. In total, there are 2000 + 500 - 50 = 2450 positive cases after the second day.
On the third day, the total number of new cases spiked to 1500 with 200 recoveries. So, the number of positives became 2450 + 1500 - 200 = 3750

On the second day, the total number of positive cases increased by 500, so the total number of cases was 2000 + 500 = 2500. On the third day, there were 1500 new cases, resulting in 2500 + 1500 = 4000 positive cases. On the third day, with 200 recoveries, the total number of positive cases decreased. Therefore, the total number of cases after the third day is 4000 - 200 = 3800.

On the first day, there were 2000 positive cases.
On the second day, the number of cases increased by 500, making it 2000 + 500 = 2500 positive cases.
Then, 50 recoveries occurred, so the total number of positive cases after the second day was 2500 - 50 = 2450.
On the third day, the total number of new cases spiked to 1500, making the total number of positive cases 2450 + 1500 = 3950.
There were then 200 recoveries, so the total number of positive cases after the third day was 3950 - 200 = 3750.

On the second day, the number of new cases increased by 500, which is 500 / 2000 * 100 = 25% of the total cases. This was followed by 50 recoveries, which means the number of positive cases decreased by 50 / 2000 * 100 = 2.5% of the total cases. On the third day, 1500 new cases were recorded, which is 1500 / 2000 * 100 = 75% of the total cases. This was followed by 200 recoveries, which means the number of positive cases decreased by 200 / 2000 * 100 = 10% of the total cases. The total number of positive cases after the third day is 2000 + 500 - 50 + 1500 - 200 = 3350.

On the second day, the total number of positive cases remained the same as the previous day, but decreased by 50 recoveries. Therefore, the total number of positive cases after the second day was 2000 - 500 + 50 = 1500. On the third day, the total number of new cases spiked to 1500 with 200 recoveries. Therefore, the total number of positive cases after the third day was 1500 - 1500 + 200 = 0.

On the first day, there were 2000 cases. On the second day, the number increased by 500 and there were 50 recoveries, so the number of new cases is calculated as:

\[ 2000 + 500 - 50 = 2450 \]

On the third day, the number of cases spiked to 1500 with 200 recoveries. Again, the number of new cases is:

\[ 1500 - 200 = 1300 \]

The total number of positive cases after the third day is:

\[ 2450 + 1300 = 3750 \]

After the first day of tests, there were 2000 positive cases.
On the second day, the number increased by 500, resulting in a total of 2000 + 500 = 2500 positive cases.
However, on the second day, there were 50 recoveries, so the total number of positive cases is reduced by 50. Thus, the total number of positive cases after the second day is 2500 - 50 = 2450.
On the third day, the total number of new cases spiked to 1500, resulting in a total of 2450 + 1500 = 3950 positive cases.
However, on the third day, there were 200 recoveries, so the total number of positive cases is reduced by 200. Thus, the total number of positive cases after the third day is 3950 - 200 = 3750.

On the first day, the total number of cases was 2000. On the second day, the number of cases increased by 500, adding an additional 500 cases to the total. However, there were 50 recoveries, so the number of new cases on the second day was \(2000 + 500 - 50 = 2450\). On the third day, the total number of positive cases spiked to 1500 with 200 recoveries.
