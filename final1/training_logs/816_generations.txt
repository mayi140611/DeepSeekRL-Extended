###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

James goes out to eat.  He orders a steak and egg meal for $16.  He is with his friend, who orders chicken fried steak for $14.  His friend pays for half the bill and James pays the tip along with his half of the bill. They tip 20%.  How much did James pay?

<reasoning>
First, we calculate the total bill by adding the cost of James's meal and his friend's meal:
\[ 16 + 14 = 30 \]

Next, we determine how much their friend paid for half of the bill:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Since James's friend paid half the bill, James alone would have to pay the remaining half, which is also $15.

James also has to pay the tip. To find the tip, we first calculate the total bill including the tip, which is 20% of the total bill:
\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]
Adding this tip to the original bill gives:
\[ 30 + 6 = 36 \]

James's bill, which includes his half of the bill and the tip, is therefore:
\[ 15 (James's share of the bill) + 6 (tip) = 21 \]

First, let's calculate the total bill for both meals:

James's meal: $16
Friend's meal: $14
Total bill: $16 + $14 = $30

Next, we'll determine how much each person pays for their meal:

James's share: $30 / 2 = $15

Now, we'll calculate the tip:

Total bill: $30
Tip rate: 20%

Tip amount: $30 * 20% = $6

James also needs to pay his share of the tip plus his half of the bill:

James's tip: $6
James's half of the bill: $15

Total amount James pays: $6 + $15 = $21

So, James paid $21.

First, let's calculate the total bill for the meal. James' steak and egg meal costs $16, and his friend's chicken fried steak meal costs $14. The total bill is:
\[ 16 + 14 = 30 \]

Since James' friend pays for half the bill, James' friend pays:

Next, we calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the total bill:
\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

Thus, James paid his share of the total bill, which includes his half of the meal and his share of the tip:
\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \]

So, James paid $21 in total.

The total bill before the tip is the sum of the steak and egg meal and chicken fried steak, which is $16 + $14 = $30.
Since James's friend pays for half the bill, James's friend pays $30 / 2 = $15.
Now, the tip is 20% of the bill, which is $30 * 0.20 = $6.
James pays along with his half of the bill and the tip, which is $15 + $6 = $21.
Therefore, the amount James paid is $21.

1. James's meal cost $16.
2. His friend's meal cost $14.
3. The total bill before tip is $16 + $14 = $30.
4. His friend pays for half the bill, which comes to $30 / 2 = $15.
5. The amount they tip is 20% of the total bill, which is 20% of $30, so $30 * 0.20 = $6.
6. James pays his half of the bill plus the tip. His half of the bill is $15, and the tip he pays is $6. So, $15 + $6 = $21.

James paid a total of $21.

To determine how much James paid, we first need to find the total bill, which is the sum of the prices of the steak and egg meal and the chicken fried steak. James's friend pays for half of the bill, so James needs to pay for the other half, including the tip.

1. Calculate the total bill:
   \[
   \text{Total Bill} = \$16 + \$14 = \$30
   \]

2. Since James's friend pays for half of the bill:
   \[
   \text{James's Share of the Bill Before Tip} = \frac{\$30}{2} = \$15
   \]

3. James pays the entire bill before the tip plus the tip amount. The tip is 20% of the total bill. To find the tip amount:
   \[
   \text{Tip Amount} = 20\% \times \$30 = 0.20 \times \$30 = \$6
   \]

4. James's total payment, which includes his half of the bill and the tip, is:
   \[
   \text{James's Total Payment} = \$15 + \$6 = \$21
   \]

So, James paid \$21 in total.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the meal. James's steak and egg meal costs $16, and his friend's chicken fried steak costs $14. Therefore, the total cost of the meal is $16 + $14 = $30. Since James's friend pays for half the bill, his friend pays $30 / 2 = $15. James must pay the other half, which is also $15. Additionally, they tip 20% of the total bill.

To calculate the total amount they paid including the tip, we first find 20% of $30: 
\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]
So, the total tip is $6. Adding the split bill and the tip, we get:
\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \]
Thus, James paid $21. 

James's friend paid $15 + half the tip of $6 = $6, which is equal to half the total bill.

Now, let's distribute the tip equally between both friends. Since James and his friend are sharing the bill and half of the tip, it should also be split equally. The split amount for the tip is simply half of the total tip, which is $6.

First, let's calculate the total bill by adding the cost of James's steak and egg meal and his friend's chicken fried steak meal:

James's meal + Friend's meal = $16 + $14 = $30

Next, we need to calculate half of the total bill, as his friend paid for this:

Half of the total bill = \( \frac{30}{2} = $15 \)

James paid half of the bill after his friend's payment. Now, we need to calculate the bill without the tip:

James's half of the bill = $15

Now, we calculate the tip which is 20% of the total bill:

Tip = \( 20\% \) of $30 = \( 0.2 \times 30 = $6 \)

Finally, we add the tip to James's half of the bill to determine the total amount he paid:

Total amount James paid = James's half of the bill + Tip = $15 + $6 = $21

Therefore, James paid $21.

To determine how much James paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the meal first. The cost of James's steak and egg meal is $16, and his friend's chicken fried steak meal is $14. Together, the total bill is:

\[ 16 + 14 = 30 \]

Since James's friend pays for half of the bill, James's friend contributes:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

James pays the tip and his half of the bill, which is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} \times 0.20 = 15 \times 0.20 = 3 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays is the tip plus his half of the bill:

\[ 3 + 15 = 18 \]

So, James pays $18.

James's friend pays for half of the bill:

James and his friend together are responsible for the remaining half of the bill:

There is a 20% tip to be paid by James and his friend. Let's calculate the tip amount:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

So, James's share of the tip is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding James's share of the bill (both the original half and his tip) gives:

Thus, James paid a total of $18.

First, we need to find the subtotal of the bill by adding the cost of James's steak and egg meal and his friend's chicken fried steak meal:

\(16 + 14 = 30\)

Next, we calculate the half of the bill, which is 1/2 of $30:

\(30 / 2 = 15\)

So James's friend paid $15 for half the bill.

Now, we calculate the total bill including the 20% tip. To do that, we first find out what the full bill would be and then add the tip:

\(15 + (0.20 * 15) = 15 + 3 = 18\)

So the total bill, including the tip, is $18.

Since James paid this amount along with half of his friend's bill:

\(15\)

Thus, James paid $15 in total.

To determine how much James paid, we need to calculate the total bill for both meals and then split the bill between James and his friend. After that, we calculate the tip and split it between them. Finally, we calculate James's share of the total bill including the tip.

1. The total bill for James and his friend is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total bill} = \text{James's meal} + \text{Friend's meal} = \$16 + \$14 = \$30
   \]

2. James's friend pays for half of the bill:
   \[
   \text{Friend's share} = \frac{\$30}{2} = \$15
   \]

3. James pays for the other half and the tip. The tip is 20% of the total bill:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 0.20 \times \$30 = \$6
   \]

4. James's share of the total bill including the tip is:
   \[
   \text{James's share} = \text{James's half of the bill} + \text{Tip} = \$15 + \$6 = \$21

To determine how much James paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total bill for both meals.
2. Determine each person's share of the bill.
3. Calculate the tip.
4. Add the tip to James's share of the bill to find out how much he paid in total.

First, let's calculate the total bill for both meals:
\[ 16 + 14 = 30 \]

Next, we find each person's share of the bill. Since his friend pays for half of the bill:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

James's friend pays $15, so James's share of the bill is also $15.

Now, let's calculate the tip. The tip percentage is 20%, so we calculate:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

James pays his tip along with his half of the bill, which is $15. Therefore, the total amount James paid is:
\[ 6 + 15 = 21 \]
