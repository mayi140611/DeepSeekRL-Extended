system
To determine how much Eve will spend on the gifts, we need to calculate the cost of each item before the discount, apply the 25% discount, and then sum the discounted prices.

1. Hand mitts cost $14.00.
2. Apron costs $16.00.
3. A set of 3 cooking utensils costs $10.00.
4. The small knife costs twice the amount of the utensils, so it costs $10.00 * 2 = $20.00.

Next, calculate the total cost of the cooking gear before the discount:
\[ 14.00 + 16.00 + 10.00 + 20.00 = 60.00 \]

Now, apply the 25% discount to the total cost:
\[ 60.00 \times (1 - 0.25) = 60.00 \times 0.75 = 45.00 \]

Therefore, Eve will spend $45.00 on the gifts.

First, we need to find the price of the small knife. Since it's twice the amount of the utensils, which are $10.00, the price of the small knife is $10.00 * 2 = $20.00.

Now, let's add up the price of all the items without any discount to get the total price for one set of gear:
- Hand mitts: $14.00
- Apron: $16.00
- Set of 3 cooking utensils: $10.00
- Small knife: $20.00

Total price for one set without discount = $14.00 + $16.00 + $10.00 + $20.00 = $60.00

Now we have to calculate the discount on this price. The store is offering a 25% off sale, so we will need to calculate 25% of $60.00 and subtract it from $60.00.
Discount = 25% of $60.00 = 0.25 * $60.00 = $15.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the total price for one set after the discount:
Total price for one set with discount = $60.00 - $15.00 = $45.00

Eve has 3 nieces, so we need to multiply the total price for one set with discount by 3 to get the total amount she will spend on the gifts:
Total amount spent = $45.00 * 3 = $135.00

First, let's determine the cost of each item before the discount:

- Hand mitts cost $14.00
- Apron costs $16.00
- A set of 3 cooking utensils cost $10.00
- A small knife costs twice the amount of the utensils, which is $20.00 (since 2 * $10.00 = $20.00)

Next, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = Hand mitts + Apron + Cooking utensils + Knife
Total cost = $14.00 + $16.00 + $10.00 + $20.00 = $60.00

Now, let's calculate the discount amount and the final price:

Discount = 25% of $60.00 = 0.25 * $60.00 = $15.00

Final price after discount = Total cost - Discount
Final price after discount = $60.00 - $15.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Eve will spend $45.00 on the gifts.

To determine how much Eve will spend on the gifts, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.

1. **Hand mitts**: $14.00
2. **Apron**: $16.00
3. **Set of 3 cooking utensils**: $10.00
4. **Small knife**: Twice the amount of the utensils ($10.00) = $20.00

Now, we sum these costs to find the total cost before the discount:
\[
14.00 + 16.00 + 10.00 + 20.00 = 60.00
\]

Since the store is offering a 25% off sale, we need to determine what 25% of $60.00 is:
\[
0.25 \times 60.00 = 15.00
\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:
\[
60.00 - 15.00 = 45.00
\]

Therefore, the amount Eve will spend on the gifts is $45.00.

To determine how much Eve will spend on her nieces' cooking gear, we first need to calculate the cost of each item without the discount and then apply the 25% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of each item:
   - Hand mitts: $14.00
   - Apron: $16.00
   - Set of 3 cooking utensils: $10.00
   - Small knife: 2 * $10.00 = $20.00

2. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   Total cost = $14.00 (hand mitts) + $16.00 (apron) + $10.00 (set of 3 cooking utensils) + $20.00 (small knife)
   Total cost = $60.00

3. Apply the 25% discount:
   Discount amount = 25% of $60.00 = 0.25 * $60.00 = $15.00

4. Calculate the final cost after the discount:
   Final cost = Total cost - Discount amount
   Final cost = $60.00 - $15.00 = $45.00

Therefore, the amount Eve will spend on the gifts is $45.00.

Let's calculate the cost for each item after the 25% discount:

Hand mitts: $14.00
Apron: $16.00
Cooking utensils: $10.00
Small knife: Twice the amount of the utensils so it's 2 * $10.00 = $20.00

Now, let's sum up the original prices of individual items:
Total cost for hand mitts and apron: $14.00 + $16.00 = $30.00
Total cost for cooking utensils and knife: $10.00 + $20.00 = $30.00

Adding the two amounts together:
Total original cost: $30.00 + $30.00 = $60.00

Now, let's calculate the 25% discount on the original total cost:

25% of $60.00 is 0.25 * $60.00 = $15.00

Subtract that from the total original cost to get the discounted amount:
Discounted amount: $60.00 - $15.00 = $45.00

Therefore, the total amount Eve will spend on the gifts is $45.00.

To determine how much Eve will spend on the gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the items for each niece and then subtract the 25% discount.

1. **Hand mitts for each niece:** 
   \[
   14.00 \times 3 = 42.00
   \]

2. **Apron for each niece:**
   \[
   16.00 \times 3 = 48.00
   \]

3. **Cooking utensils for each niece:**
   \[
   10.00 \times 3 = 30.00
   \]

4. **Small knife for each niece:**
   \[
   2 \times 10.00 = 20.00
   \]

5. **Total cost for one niece:**
   \[
   42.00 + 48.00 + 30.00 + 20.00 = 140.00
   \]

6. **Total cost for three nieces:**
   \[
   140.00 \times 3 = 420.00
   \]

7. **Discount**:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 420.00 = 0.25 \times 420.00 = 105.00
   \]

8. **Final amount spent after discount:**
   \[
   420.00 - 105.00 = 315.00
   \]

Therefore, Eve will spend \(\boxed{315.00}\) dollars on the gifts.

To determine how much Eve will spend on the gifts, let's break down the cost of each item and then apply the 25% discount.

1. **Hand mitts:**
   - Cost: $14.00

2. **Apron:**
   - Cost: $16.00

3. **Set of 3 cooking utensils:**
   - Cost: $10.00

4. **Small knife:**
   - Cost: Twice the cost of the utensils
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 10 \) = $20.00

Next, we add up the costs of all the items before applying the discount:

\[
14 + 16 + 10 + 20 = 60
\]

The total cost of the cooking gear is $60.00.

Now, we apply the 25% discount to the total cost:

\[
\text{Discount amount} = 0.25 \times 60 = 15
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Eve will spend:

\[
60 - 15 = 45

To find out how much Eve will spend on the gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 25% discount to that total.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:
1. Hand mitts: $14.00
2. Apron: $16.00
3. Set of 3 cooking utensils: $10.00
4. Small knife: $10.00 (since it's twice the amount of the utensils, which cost $10)

Now, let's add these up to get the total cost before the discount:
$14.00 (mitts) + $16.00 (apron) + $10.00 (utensils) + $10.00 (knife) = $50.00

The store is offering a 25% discount on all cooking gear. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $50.00:
25% of $50.00 = 0.25 * $50.00 = $12.50

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the total cost after the discount:
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $12.50 = $37.50

Therefore, Eve will spend $37.50 on the gifts.

First, let's calculate the cost of one small knife:

Small knife = 2 * 10.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of a set of cooking utensils:

Cooking utensils = 10.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost without the discount:

Total cost = 2 * 14.00 (hand mitts) + 1 * 16.00 (apron) + 3 * 10.00 (utensils) + 2 * 20.00 (knives)

Total cost = $114.00

Now, let's calculate the discount:

Discount = 25% of $114.00
Discount = 0.25 * 114.00
Discount = $28.50

Finally, let's calculate the total cost with the discount:

To find the total cost of the cooking gear for Eve's nieces, we need to add up the costs of one set of kid's cooking gear.

1. A set of 3 cooking utensils costs $10.00.
2. A small knife is twice the amount of the utensils, so it costs $10.00 * 2 = $20.00.
3. One hand mitt costs $14.00.
4. One apron costs $16.00.

Total cost before the discount = $10.00 + $20.00 + $14.00 + $16.00 = $60.00.

The store is offering a 25% discount on all cooking gear. To find 25% of $60.00, we calculate \(60.00 \times 0.25 = 15.00\).

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final amount Eve will spend:

$60.00 - $15.00 = $45.00.

First, we calculate the cost of the items without the discount. The cost of one set of cooking utensils is $10.00. Since a set of 3 cooking utensils costs twice as much, the cost for three sets is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the apron:
\[ 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the hand mitts is:
\[ 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum these costs to find the total cost before the discount:
\[ 14 + 16 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The store is offering a 25% discount on all cooking gear. We calculate the discount amount by finding 25% of the total cost before the discount:
\[ 0.25 \times 60 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

We then subtract this discount from the total cost to find the amount Eve will spend:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Discounted total cost = $60.00 * (1 - 0.25) = $60.00 * 0.75 = $45.00

Finally, we calculate the cost for 3 nieces, since Eve wants to buy cooking gear for them all:

Now, let's calculate the total cost of one complete set of cooking gear:
Total for one set = Hand mitts + Apron + Utensils + Knife = $14.00 + $16.00 + $10.00 + $20.00 = $60.00

Since Eve wants to buy cooking gear for 3 nieces, we need to calculate the total cost for 3 sets:
Total for 3 sets = 3 * $60.00 = $180.00

The store is offering a 25% off sale, so Eve needs to calculate the discount:
Discount = 25% of $180.00 = 0.25 * $180.00 = $45.00

Finally, let's calculate how much Eve will spend after the discount:
