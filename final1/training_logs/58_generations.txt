system
To find the total amount of money the 60 students get in a day, we need to calculate the contributions of both groups of students and then sum them up.

1. First, we need to determine how many students receive $6 per day. This can be calculated as:

   \[ \text{Number of students receiving $6} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 \]
   
   \[ = 40 \]

2. For the remaining students who receive $4 per day, we subtract the number of students receiving $6 from total students:

   \[ \text{Number of students receiving $4} = 60 - 40 \]
   
   \[ = 20 \]

3. Now, we calculate the total amount for each group:

   - Total money received by students getting $6:

     \[ \text{Total amount for $6 students} = 40 \times 6 \]

     \[ = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

   - Total money received by students getting $4:

     \[ \text{Total amount for $4 students} = 20 \times 4 \]

     \[ = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Finally, to find the total amount of money received by all students in a day:

   \[ \text{Total amount} = 240 + 80 \]

   \[ = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $320.

Let's break down the problem:

1. 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 a day.
2. 1/3 of the students receive an average of $4 a day.
3. There are a total of 60 students surveyed.
4. We need to calculate the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. First, calculate the number of students receiving $6 a day:
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) students.

2. Next, calculate the number of students receiving $4 a day:
   \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) students.

3. Now, calculate the total amount of money for the 40 students receiving $6 a day:
   \( 40 \times 6 = 240 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the total amount of money for the 20 students receiving $4 a day:
   \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \) dollars.

5. Finally, sum the amounts from both groups to get the total:
   \( 240 + 80 = 320 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $320.

reasoning:
Let's break down the problem.
If the student surveyed 60 students, there are two groups of students. $\frac{2}{3}$ of students receive $6 a day, while the rest $4 a day. There are 40 students in the first group and 20 students in the second group.
Now we need to find the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day.
answer:
$6 \times (40 \times \frac{2}{3}) + $4 \times (20 \times \frac{1}{3})$, or $240 + 26.67$, which is $266.67.

Therefore, the answer is $266.67.

system
Reasoning:
First, let's determine the number of students who receive $6 per day and the number who receive $4 per day.
2/3 of 60 students receive $6 allowance per day, so (2/3) * 60 = 40 students receive this amount.
The rest, 60 - 40 = 20 students, receive $4 per day.

Now, let's calculate the total daily allowance for each group.
$6 allowance per day * 40 students = $240 for the first group.
$4 allowance per day * 20 students = $80 for the second group.

To find the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day, we add the two amounts together.
$240 + $80 = $320 total daily allowance for the 60 students.

Answer:
The total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $320.

To find the total amount of money the 60 students get in a day, we can calculate the amount each group receives and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many students receive an average of $6 allowance per day. 

According to the survey, 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 allowance per day. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of students receiving $6 allowance} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 \]

\[ = 40 \]

So, 40 students get an average of $6 allowance per day.

Next, let's find out how many students receive an average of $4 allowance per day. Since there are 60 students in total, we subtract the number of students receiving $6 allowance from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of students receiving $4 allowance} = 60 - 40 \]

\[ = 20 \]

So, 20 students get an average of $4 allowance per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money received by the students in each group:

\[ \text{Total amount for students receiving $6 allowance} = 40 \times 6 \]

\[ = \$240 \]

\[ \text{Total amount for students receiving $4 allowance} = 20 \times 4 \]

\[ = \$80 \]

Finally, let's add the total amounts received by both groups to get the grand total:

\[ \text{Total amount of money} = \$240 + \$80 \]

\[ = \$320 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the 60 students get in a day is $320.

First, we need to determine how many students fall into each category based on the given survey. 

Given that 2/3 of the students receive $6 allowance per day, the number of students in this category is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ students} \]

Since these are the only two categories mentioned, the rest of the students must receive the $4 allowance per day. Therefore, the number of students receiving $4 allowance per day is:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ students} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money received by the students in the $6 category:
\[ 40 \times 6 = 240 \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of money received by the students in the $4 category:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

Finally, we find the total amount of money received by all 60 students in a day:
\[ 240 + 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $320.

To find the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day, we first need to determine how many students receive $6 and how many receive $4. Based on the survey, 2/3 of the students receive $6, so:

\[ \text{Number receiving $6} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

The rest of the students, which is 1/3 of the total number of students, receive $4. So:

\[ \text{Number receiving $4} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money received by all students. For the students receiving $6:

\[ 40 \times 6 = 240 \]

For the students receiving $4:

\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of money received by all students:

\[ 240 + 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $320.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money received by the students and then divide it by the number of students surveyed. In this case, the students are split into two groups: those receiving an average of $6 per day and those receiving an average of $4 per day.

We are given that \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the students receive an average of $6 per day and the rest receive an average of $4 per day. Therefore, the remaining portion of the students (which is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of them) receive $4 in allowance per day.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money received by the \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the students:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \text{ of students} \times \$6 \text{ per day} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ students} \times 6 = 4 \text{ students} \times 6 = \$24
\]

Next, we calculate the amount received by the \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the students:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \text{ of students} \times \$4 \text{ per day} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ students} \times 4 = 1 \text{ student} \times 4 = \$4
\]

Now, we add these two amounts to get the total amount of money received by all 60 students:
\[
\$24 + \$4 = \$28
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money received by the 60 students in a day is:
\[
\boxed{\$28}
\]

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Find the number of students receiving $4 a day:**
   Since 2/3 of the students receive $6 a day, we calculate the number of students as follows:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 students receive $4 a day.

2. **Find the number of students receiving $6 a day:**
   The rest of the students (1/3 of 60) receive $6 a day. Since 40 students receive $4 a day, the number of students receiving $6 a day is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount for students receiving $4 a day:**
   Each of these 40 students receives $4 a day, so the total amount for these students is:
   \[
   40 \times 4 = 160
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount for students receiving $6 a day:**
   Each of these 20 students receives $6 a day, so the total amount for these students is:
   \[
   20 \times 6 = 120
   \]

5. **Add the two totals to find the overall total amount:**
   \[
   160 + 120 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $280.

To find the total amount of money the students receive in a day, we first need to find out how many students receive each amount and then multiply each by the average daily allowance.

2/3 of the students receive $6 allowance per day, so to find how many students that is, we calculate:
(2/3) * 60 = 40 students

The rest of the students receive $4 allowance per day. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who receive $6 per day from the total number of students surveyed:
60 - 40 = 20 students

Now we can calculate the total amount of money the students get in a day by multiplying the number of students by their respective average daily allowances:
40 students * $6/student = $240
20 students * $4/student = $80

Finally, we add the two totals together to find the total amount of money:
$240 + $80 = $320

The total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $320.

Let's break down the problem:

- There are 60 students in total.
- \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the students receive an average of $6 per day.
- \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the students receive an average of $4 per day.

First, calculate the number of students who receive $6 allowance per day:
\[ \text{Number of students receiving $6 per day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

Next, calculate the number of students who receive $4 allowance per day:
\[ \text{Number of students receiving $4 per day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

Now, calculate the total amount of money received by the students who receive $6 per day:
\[ \text{Total for students getting $6 per day} = 40 \times 6 = 240 \]

Then, calculate the total amount of money received by the students who receive $4 per day:
\[ \text{Total for students getting $4 per day} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

Finally, add the two totals to find the overall average daily allowance:
\[ \text{Overall average daily allowance} = 240 + 80 = 320 \]

To find the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day, consider that each student contributes $320 in total:
\[ \text{Total amount for 60 students} = 60 \times 320 = 19200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $\boxed{19200}$.

To find the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day, we need to calculate the average allowance for the entire group.

First, let's find out how many students receive $6 allowance per day and how many receive $4 allowance per day.

- Number of students receiving $6 allowance per day = 2/3 * Total number of students
- Number of students receiving $4 allowance per day = (1 - 2/3) * Total number of students

Given that the total number of students is 60:

- Number of students receiving $6 allowance per day = 2/3 * 60 = 40 students
- Number of students receiving $4 allowance per day = (1 - 2/3) * 60 = 20 students

Now, we calculate the total amount of money:

- Total allowance from students receiving $6 per day = 40 * $6 = $240
- Total allowance from students receiving $4 per day = 20 * $4 = $80

Finally, we add these two amounts to get the total amount of money:

- Total amount of money = $240 + $80 = $320

Therefore, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $320.

To find the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day, we need to consider both the groups surveyed. The students can either be in the first group that receive $6 a day or in the second group that receive $4 a day. Since we don't know which group they belong to, we will consider both possibilities.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money the first group receives. If 2/3 of the students receive $6 a day, we can calculate the number of students in this group as follows:

Number of students in the first group = 2/3 * 60 = 40 students

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money these 40 students get:

Total amount from the first group = 40 students * $6/student = $240

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the remaining students in the second group receive. Since we don't know the number of students in the second group, we'll assume that the remaining students are in the second group. The total number of students in the second group is:

Number of students in the second group = 60 total students - 40 students in the first group = 20 students

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money these 20 students get:

Total amount from the second group = 20 students * $4/student = $80

Finally, to find the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day, we add the amounts from both groups:

Total amount = Total amount from the first group + Total amount from the second group
Total amount = $240 + $80 = $320

Therefore, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $320.

To find the total amount of money the 60 students get in a day, we need to calculate the total amount for the students who receive $6 daily allowance and the total amount for the students who receive $4 daily allowance.

First, we calculate the number of students receiving $6 daily allowance:
2/3 of 60 students receive $6 daily allowance.
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we calculate the number of students receiving $4 daily allowance:
The rest of the students receive $4 daily allowance.
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ students} \]
\[ 20 \text{ students} \times 4 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money the students get in a day:
\[ 40 \text{ students} \times 6 \text{ dollars/student} + 20 \text{ students} \times 4 \text{ dollars/student} \]
\[ 240 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 320 \text{ dollars} \]
