###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

The city’s bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day. How many people does the bus system carry for 13 weeks?

#### ANS ####

109,200,000
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To calculate the number of people the bus system carries in 13 weeks, we first need to determine the number of days in 13 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ 13 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ days} \]

Next, we multiply the number of days by the number of people the bus system carries each day:

\[ 91 \text{ days} \times 1,200,000 \text{ people/day} = 109,200,000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the bus system carries 109,200,000 people in 13 weeks.

system
To determine the number of people the bus system carries in 13 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of days in 13 weeks.

Number of days in 13 weeks = 13 weeks * 7 days/week = 91 days

Now, we know that the city’s bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day. To find the total number of people carried in 91 days, we multiply the daily ridership by the number of days:

Total riders = 1,200,000 people/day * 91 days = 109,200,000 people

So, the bus system carries 109,200,000 people in 13 weeks.

To determine how many people the bus system carries in 13 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of days in 13 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of days in 13 weeks is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) days.

Given that the bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day, the total number of people carried in 91 days is \(91 \times 1,200,000 = 109,200,000\).

So, the bus system carries 109,200,000 people in 13 weeks.

system
To find out how many people the bus system carries for 13 weeks, we first need to calculate the daily total number of people the bus system carries. 

Given that the bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day, we need to calculate the weekly total by multiplying this number by the number of days in a week:

\[ 1,200,000 \text{ people/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 8,400,000 \text{ people/week} \]

Next, to find the total number of people carried in 13 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks:

\[ 8,400,000 \text{ people/week} \times 13 \text{ weeks} = 109,200,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the bus system carries 109,200,000 people for 13 weeks.

To calculate the number of people the bus system carries in 13 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days in 13 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily passenger count.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days in 13 weeks.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 13 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ days} \]

Step 2: Multiply the number of days by the daily passenger count.
The bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day, so:
\[ 1,200,000 \text{ people/day} \times 91 \text{ days} = 109,200,000 \text{ people} \]

To calculate the total number of people carried by the city's bus system for 13 weeks, we first need to determine how many days are in 13 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate 13 weeks by multiplying 13 by 7:

\[ 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ days} \]

Next, since the bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day, we can find the total number of people carried in 91 days by multiplying the daily capacity by the number of days:

\[ 1,200,000 \times 91 = 109,200,000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the bus system carries 109,200,000 people for 13 weeks.

   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, \( 13 \) weeks times \( 7 \) days per week equals:
   \[
   13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of people carried in 91 days:**
   - The bus system carries \( 1,200,000 \) people each day.
   - Therefore, \( 1,200,000 \) people times \( 91 \) days equals:

To find the total number of people the bus system carries for 13 weeks, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Determine the number of days in 13 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 13 weeks would have \( 13 \times 7 = 91 \) days.
2. Calculate the total number of people carried in a month by multiplying the number of people carried each day by the number of days in a week: \( 1,200,000 \times 7 = 8,400,000 \).
3. Since the question asks for the total for 13 weeks, we multiply the number of people carried in a month by 13: \( 8,400,000 \times 13 = 109,200,000 \).

Therefore, the bus system carries 109,200,000 people for 13 weeks.

system
To find out how many people the bus system carries in 13 weeks, we need to calculate the number of buses that operate per day and then multiply by the number of weeks.

1. First, calculate the number of buses that operate per day. The bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day, but we need the number of buses. Assuming there is one bus per person for simplicity, the number of buses is equal to the number of people transported, which is 1,200,000.

2. Now, calculate the number of buses operated in 13 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, in one week there are \(7 \times 13 = 91\) days. Therefore, the total number of buses operated in 13 weeks is \(91 \times 1,200,000\).

3. Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   91 \times 1,200,000 = 91 \times (1,000,000 + 200,000) = 91 \times 1,000,000 + 91 \times 200,000 = 91,000,000 + 18,200,000 = 109,200,000.
   \]

So, the bus system carries 109,200,000 people in 13 weeks.

   \[
   \text{Number of days} = 13 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total number of people carried by multiplying the number of days by the number of people carried per day:
   \[
   \text{Total people} = 91 \text{ days} \times 1,200,000 \text{ people/day} = 1,092,000,000 \text{ people}

To calculate the total number of people the bus system carries in 13 weeks, we need to multiply the daily number of riders by the total number of days in 13 weeks.

1 week has 7 days, so 13 weeks have \( 13 \times 7 = 91 \) days.

The daily number of riders is 1,200,000.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 1,200,000 \text{ people/day} \times 91 \text{ days} = 109,200,000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the bus system carries 109,200,000 people in 13 weeks.
