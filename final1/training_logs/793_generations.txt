<reasoning>
To find out how much dog food Hannah should prepare each day, we need to calculate the daily food consumption for each dog and then sum them up.

1. The first dog eats 1.5 cups of dog food a day.
2. The second dog eats twice as much as the first dog, which is:
   \( 1.5 \text{ cups} \times 2 = 3 \text{ cups} \).

3. The third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog, which is:
   \( 3 \text{ cups} + 2.5 \text{ cups} = 5.5 \text{ cups} \).

Now, we can add the daily food consumption for all three dogs:
\( 1.5 \text{ cups} + 3 \text{ cups} + 5.5 \text{ cups} = 10 \text{ cups} \).

Therefore, Hannah should prepare 10 cups of dog food each day for her three dogs.

The second dog eats twice as much as the first dog, which eats 1.5 cups a day. Therefore, the second dog eats \(2 \times 1.5 = 3\) cups a day. The third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog, so it eats \(3 + 2.5 = 5.5\) cups a day. To find out how much dog food Hannah should prepare in a day for her three dogs, we add the daily consumption of each dog:

- First dog: 1.5 cups
- Second dog: 3 cups
- Third dog: 5.5 cups

So the total amount of food Hannah should prepare in a day is \(1.5 + 3 + 5.5 = 10\) cups.

To determine the total cups of dog food Hannah should prepare in a day for her three dogs, we first need to calculate the daily food consumption for each dog.

1. The first dog eats:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. The second dog eats twice as much as the first dog:
   \[
   2 \times 1.5 = 3 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. The third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog:
   \[
   3 + 2.5 = 5.5 \text{ cups}
   \]

Next, we sum the daily food consumption for all three dogs:
\[
1.5 + 3 + 5.5 = 10 \text{ cups}
\]

Thus, Hannah should prepare 10 cups of dog food in a day for her three dogs.

Perform the addition:

Let's break down the amount of dog food each dog eats in a day:
- The first dog eats 1.5 cups.
- The second dog eats twice as much as the first dog, which means it eats \(2 \times 1.5 = 3\) cups.
- The third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog, so it eats \(3 + 2.5 = 5.5\) cups.

Now, let's add up the total amount of dog food they eat together:
- First dog: 1.5 cups
- Second dog: 3 cups
- Third dog: 5.5 cups

Total = 1.5 + 3 + 5.5 = 10 cups.

Therefore, Hannah should prepare 10 cups of dog food in a day for her three dogs.
