#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out how many cupcakes Quinton had left over, we first need to determine the total number of cupcakes he gave away.

First, Quinton gave cupcakes to:
- 18 students in Ms. Delmont's class
- 16 students in Mrs. Donnelly's class

This gives us:
\[ 18 + 16 = 34 \text{ cupcakes} \]

He also gave a cupcake to:
- Ms. Delmont
- Mrs. Donnelly
- The school nurse
- The school principal

This gives us:
\[ 4 \text{ cupcakes} \]

So, in total, Quinton gave away:
\[ 34 + 4 = 38 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Quinton started with 40 cupcakes. Therefore, the number of cupcakes he had left over is:
\[ 40 - 38 = 2 \]

So, Quinton had 2 cupcakes left over.

To determine how many cupcakes Quinton had left over, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes he gave away.

First, Quinton gave cupcakes to the students in Ms. Delmont's class. He gave 18 cupcakes to these students.

Next, he gave cupcakes to the students in Mrs. Donnelly's class. He gave 16 more cupcakes to these students.

Then, he gave cupcakes to himself, Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal. This totals 5 more cupcakes.

Now, we add up all the cupcakes given away:
\[ 18 + 16 + 5 = 39 \]

Quinton started with 40 cupcakes. After giving away 39 cupcakes, the number of cupcakes he has left over is:
\[ 40 - 39 = 1 \]

Therefore, Quinton has 1 cupcake left over.

To determine how many cupcakes Quinton had left over, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes he distributed and then subtract that from the number of cupcakes he originally brought.

1. Quinton distributed cupcakes to 18 students in Ms. Delmont's class.
2. He also distributed cupcakes to 16 students in Mrs. Donnelly's class.
3. He gave a cupcake to each of 4 teachers (Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal).

First, we calculate the total number of cupcakes distributed to the students:
\[ 
\text{Cupcakes to Ms. Delmont's class} = 18 
\]
\[ 
\text{Cupcakes to Mrs. Donnelly's class} = 16 
\]
\[ 
\text{Cupcakes to teachers} = 4 \times 1 = 4 
\]

Adding these together gives:
\[ 
\text{Total cupcakes distributed} = 18 + 16 + 4 = 38 
\]

Quinton originally brought 40 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes are left over, we subtract the total distributed from the original number:
\[ 
\text{Cupcakes left over} = 40 - 38 = 2 
\]

Let's calculate the total number of cupcakes Quinton used for the students and staff:

1. Ms. Delmont's class: 18 students
2. Mrs. Donnelly's class: 16 students
3. Ms. Delmont: 1 person
4. Mrs. Donnelly: 1 person
5. School nurse: 1 person
6. School principal: 1 person

Total cupcakes given:
\[
18 + 16 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38

Quinton started with 40 cupcakes. After giving out 38 cupcakes, he would have:
\[
40 - 38 = 2

Quinton started with 40 cupcakes. He gave cupcakes to 18 students in Ms. Delmont's class, 16 students in Mrs. Donnelly's class, and 4 other individuals (Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal). 

First, we calculate the total number of cupcakes given to the students:
\[ 18 + 16 = 34 \]

Next, we add the cupcakes given to the other individuals to account for all gifts:
\[ 34 + 4 = 38 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of cupcakes given from the initial amount to find out how many are left:
\[ 40 - 38 = 2 \]

Therefore, Quinton had 2 cupcakes left.

To find out how many cupcakes Quinton has left, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes given away and then subtract that from the total number of cupcakes he brought to school.

1. Calculate the number of cupcakes given to Ms. Delmont's class: 18 cupcakes.
2. Calculate the number of cupcakes given to Mrs. Donnelly's class: 16 cupcakes.
3. Calculate the number of cupcakes given to the staff (Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal): 
   - Ms. Delmont: 1 cupcake
   - Mrs. Donnelly: 1 cupcake
   - School nurse: 1 cupcake
   - School principal: 1 cupcake
4. Add these amounts together to get the total number of cupcakes given away:
   - 18 from Ms. Delmont's class + 16 from Mrs. Donnelly's class + 1 from Ms. Delmont + 1 from Mrs. Donnelly + 1 from the school nurse + 1 from the school principal = 42 cupcakes given away.

5. Subtract the total number of cupcakes given away from the number brought:

1. Start with 40 cupcakes originally.
2. Subtract the 42 cupcakes given away:
   40 - 42 = -2

Since it's not possible to have a negative number of cupcakes, it means Quinton ran out of cupcakes and didn't have any left over, but he was short by 2 cupcakes. 

Therefore, Quinton had no cupcakes left over.

First, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes Quinton gave to the students in his classes and to the teachers. This can be calculated as follows:

- Cupcakes given to students in Ms. Delmont's class: 18
- Cupcakes given to students in Mrs. Donnelly's class: 16
- Cupcakes given to Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal: 4 teachers + 1 principal = 5

Therefore, Quinton gave a total of \(18 + 16 + 5 = 39\) cupcakes.

Quinton initially had 40 cupcakes, so the number of cupcakes left over would be \(40 - 39 = 1\).

First, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes given to the students:
- Ms. Delmont's class: 18 students
- Mrs. Donnelly's class: 16 students
Total cupcakes given to students = 18 + 16 = 34 cupcakes

Quinton also gave cupcakes to:
- Ms. Delmont
- Mrs. Donnelly
- The school nurse
- The school principal

This is a total of 4 more cupcakes.

Adding these to the cupcakes given to the students:
Total cupcakes given = 34 (students) + 4 (administrators) = 38 cupcakes

Quinton originally had 40 cupcakes. Now we need to find out how many are left:

40 (initial cupcakes) - 38 (given out) = 2 cupcakes left

Therefore, Quinton has 2 cupcakes left over.

He gave cupcakes to 18 students in Ms. Delmont's class, 16 students in Mrs. Donnelly's class, Ms. Delmont himself, Mrs. Donnelly herself, the school nurse, and the school principal, totaling 47 cupcakes. Since he started with 40 cupcakes, we can subtract this from the total cupcakes given to see how many are left over. The calculation is straightforward: \(40 - 40 = 0\).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Quinton brought 40 cupcakes to school.
2. He gave a cupcake to each student in Ms. Delmont's class, which consists of 18 students.
3. He also gave a cupcake to each student in Mrs. Donnelly's class, which comprises 16 students.
4. He gave a cupcake to Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal, which totals 4 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes given away:

- Cupcakes given to Ms. Delmont's class: 18 cupcakes
- Cupcakes given to Mrs. Donnelly's class: 16 cupcakes
- Cupcakes given to Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal: 4 cupcakes

Total cupcakes given away = 18 (Ms. Delmont's class) + 16 (Mrs. Donnelly's class) + 4 (Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal) = 38 cupcakes

Now, let's find out how many cupcakes Quinton had left over:

Initial number of cupcakes = 40
Total cupcakes given away = 38
Cupcakes left over = 40 - 38 = 2 cupcakes

The answer is 2 cupcakes left over.

To determine how many cupcakes Quinton had left over, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes he gave away and then subtract this from the initial number of cupcakes he brought. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Cupcakes for Ms. Delmont's class:**
   - Number of students: 18
   - Cupcakes per student: 1
   - Total cupcakes given to Ms. Delmont's class: \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \)

2. **Cupcakes for Mrs. Donnelly's class:**
   - Number of students: 16
   - Cupcakes per student: 1
   - Total cupcakes given to Mrs. Donnelly's class: \( 16 \times 1 = 16 \)

3. **Cupcakes for Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal:**
   - These are 4 individuals.
   - Total cupcakes given to these 4 people: \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \)

4. **Total cupcakes given away:**
   - Sum of cupcakes given to each group: \( 18 + 16 + 4 = 38 \)

5. **Initial number of cupcakes:**
   - Quinton brought 40 cupcakes.

6. **Cupcakes left over:**
   - Subtract the total cupcakes given away from the initial number of cupcakes: \( 40 - 38 = 2 \)

Therefore, Quinton had 2 cupcakes left over.
