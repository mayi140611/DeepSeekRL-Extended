To calculate the total hours children spend watching television in 2 weeks given the daily and weekly restrictions, follow these steps:

1. **Daily Watching Time**: Each child watches television for 45 minutes per day.
2. **Weekly Watching Time**: There are 4 days in a week, so the total weekly watching time is \( 45 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \).
3. **Convert Minutes to Hours**: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, convert the weekly watching time to hours: 
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \].
4. **Two-Week Total**: Over 2 weeks, the total time is \( 3 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Now, put the information together:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} \]

First, we need to find out how many minutes children watch television in 2 weeks.

In one week, they watch:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

In two weeks, they watch:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we convert 360 minutes into hours:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

First, we need to calculate the total number of hours children 6-11 years old watch television each day. The study indicates that children spend 45 minutes each day watching television.

Convert 45 minutes to hours: \( \frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \) hours.

Next, calculate the total daily hours for the 2-week period considering that they watch 4 days a week: \( 0.75 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \).

Finally, calculate the total hours for 2 weeks: \( 3 \text{ hours/week} \times 14 \text{ weeks} = 42 \text{ hours} \).

So, in 2 weeks, these children watch television for a total of 42 hours.

The children watch 45 minutes each day on 4 days, which is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes a week. Then we convert minutes to hours: 1/6 days = 180 minutes/60 = 3 hours. So the children watch 3 hours of television in a week. In two weeks, they watch 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes children watch television in 2 weeks.
2. Convert the total minutes into hours.

First, we know that children watch television for 45 minutes each day and they are allowed to watch it 4 days a week. Therefore, the total minutes watched in one week is:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, to find out the total minutes watched in 2 weeks, we multiply:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, to convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how many hours children 6–11 years old watch television in 2 weeks if they are allowed to watch it 4 days a week, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the daily television watching time: 45 minutes per day for 6-11-year-olds.
2. Calculate the total weekly television watching time: Multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week (7 days).
3. Convert the weekly watching time from minutes to hours.

Now, let's perform the calculations:
1. Total weekly time in minutes: \( 45 \text{ minutes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 315 \text{ minutes/week} \).
2. Convert minutes to hours: \( 315 \text{ minutes/week} = 315 \text{ minutes} / 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 5.25 \text{ hours/week} \).
3. Calculate the total time in 2 weeks: \( 5.25 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10.5 \text{ hours} \).

So, children 6–11 years old watch television for approximately 10.5 hours in 2 weeks.

First, we need to calculate the total time children watch television in a week. 
Total time:45 minutes x 4 days = 180 minutes
Next, to convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours

Therefore, children watch television for 3 hours in 1 week.
Now we need to calculate for 2 weeks. We multiply the hours per week by 2:
3 hours x 2 = 6 hours

To find out how many hours these children watch television in 2 weeks, we'll first determine the total number of minutes they watch television in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, each child watches 45 minutes of television each day. Over 4 days a week, they watch:

First, we need to determine how many hours children 6-11 years old spend watching television each week. The study mentioned that children spend 45 minutes each day watching television. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the number of hours spent by multiplying the daily time spent by 7:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 315 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time spent in minutes to hours. We know that 60 minutes are equal to 1 hour, so:
\[ 315 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 5.25 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, to find out how many hours children spend watching television in 2 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 2:
\[ 5.25 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10.5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, children 6-11 years old spend 10.5 hours watching television in 2 weeks if they are allowed to watch television 4 days a week.

To determine how many hours children 6-11 years old watch television in 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the total minutes they watch per week, then convert that to hours, and finally account for the two-week period.

Given:
- Children watch 45 minutes each day.
- They watch television 4 days a week.
- They are watched 2 weeks.

First, calculate the total minutes watched per week:
\[ 45 \, \text{minutes/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 180 \, \text{minutes/week} \]

Then, convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{180 \, \text{minutes/week}}{60 \, \text{minutes/hour}} = 3 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Now, calculate the total hours watched in 2 weeks:
\[ 3 \, \text{hours/week} \times 2 \, \text{weeks} = 6 \, \text{hours} \]

So, children in this age group watch 6 hours of television in 2 weeks.

To determine how many hours these children spend watching television in 2 weeks, we first need to understand the total amount of time they watch television each day.

Given that children aged 6-11 watch 45 minutes of television each day, and they are allowed to watch television 4 days a week, the total minutes watched each week is:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to convert these minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours they watch television in 2 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 2:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the children watch 6 hours of television in 2 weeks.

First, we calculate the daily TV watching time for the children, which is given as 45 minutes. Since they watch TV for 45 minutes each day that they can watch it. To find out how many days they can watch in a week, we need to multiply the number of days they watch TV by the number of minutes they watch each day, then we will divide by 60 to get the hours.

Next, we multiply the number of days they can watch TV by the number of hours they watch each day to get the total hours spent watching TV in one week. Since we need to find out the total hours spent watching TV in 2 weeks, we will multiply the total hours watched in one week by 2.

Let's do the calculations:

45 minutes/day * 4 days/week * 2 = 360 minutes/week

360 minutes/week * 2 = 720 minutes/2 weeks

To convert minutes to hours, we divide 720 minutes by 60 minutes/1 hour:

720 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 12 hours/2 weeks

We start by calculating how many hours these children watch television daily. The study indicates they spend 45 minutes each day watching television. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to \( 45/60 = 0.75 \) hours per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of hours they watch television in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week and they watch for 4 days, the number of hours in one week is:
\[ 0.75 \times 4 = 3 \text{ hours} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find the number of hours they watch television in 2 weeks. Since 2 weeks is \( 2 \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ days} \):
