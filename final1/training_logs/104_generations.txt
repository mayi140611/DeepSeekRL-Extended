#### ANS ####

96
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine the total number of people the boat can transport in 2 days, we first need to calculate the number of people it can transport in one day. Then, we multiply that by 2.

From the information given:
- There are 4 boat trips per day.
- Each trip can take up to 12 people.

Calculating the number of people transported in one day:
\[ 4 \text{ trips/day} \times 12 \text{ people/trip} = 48 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, we multiply the number of people transported in one day by 2 to get the number for 2 days:
\[ 48 \text{ people/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 96 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the boat can transport 96 people in 2 days.

The boat can transport a maximum of 12 people during one trip. During one day, there are 4 boat trips.
12 x 4 = 48
The boat can transport a maximum of 48 people in one day.
48 x 2 = 96

The answer is 96.

system
To solve this problem, first, we need to determine the number of people the boat can transport in one day. Since there are 4 boat trips and each trip can take up to 12 people, we multiply the number of trips by the maximum number of people per trip:

4 trips/day * 12 people/trip = 48 people/day

Now that we know the boat can transport 48 people in one day, we can find out how many people it can transport in 2 days by multiplying the number of people transported in one day by the number of days:

48 people/day * 2 days = 96 people

Therefore, in 2 days, the boat can transport at most 96 people.

To determine how many people the boat can transport in 2 days, we first need to calculate how many people it can transport in one day and then multiply that by 2.

1. **Calculate the number of people the boat can transport in one day:**
   - There are 4 boat trips each day.
   - Each trip can carry up to 12 people.
   \[
   \text{People transported in one day} = 4 \text{ trips/day} \times 12 \text{ people/trip} = 48 \text{ people/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of people the boat can transport in 2 days:**
   - We need to multiply the number of people transported in one day by 2.
   \[
   \text{People transported in 2 days} = 48 \text{ people/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 96 \text{ people}
   \]

Therefore, the boat can transport 96 people in 2 days.

To determine how many people the boat can transport in 2 days, we will follow these steps:

1. Find out how many people the boat can transport in one day:
   - There are 4 boat trips in one day.
   - The boat can take up to 12 people per trip.
   - Therefore, the number of people transported in one day is:
     \[
     4 \text{ trips/day} \times 12 \text{ people/trip} = 48 \text{ people/day}
     \]

2. Determine the total number of people transported in 2 days:
   - The boat can transport 48 people in one day.
   - To find the total for 2 days, multiply the number of people transported in one day by 2:
     \[
     48 \text{ people/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 96 \text{ people}
     \]

3. Conclude with the final answer:
   - The boat can transport 96 people in 2 days.

\[
\boxed{96}

To calculate the number of people the boat can transport in 2 days, we first need to determine the number of people it can transport during one day and then multiply that by 2.

1. Number of trips per day: 4
2. Maximum capacity per trip: 12 people

First, calculate the number of people the boat can transport in one day:
\[
4 \text{ trips/day} \times 12 \text{ people/trip} = 48 \text{ people/day}
\]

Now, calculate the total number of people the boat can transport in 2 days:
\[
48 \text{ people/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 96 \text{ people}
\]

So, the boat can transport a total of 96 people in 2 days.

To determine how many people the boat can transport in 2 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people the boat can transport in one day.
2. Multiply the number of people transported in one day by the number of days (2 days).

Step 1: Calculate the number of people transported in one day.
The boat can take up to 12 people on each trip, and there are 4 trips in one day. Therefore, the number of people transported in one day is:
\[ 12 \text{ people/trip} \times 4 \text{ trips/day} = 48 \text{ people/day} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of people transported in 2 days.
Since the boat can transport 48 people in one day, the number of people transported in 2 days is:
\[ 48 \text{ people/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 96 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the boat can transport 96 people in 2 days.
