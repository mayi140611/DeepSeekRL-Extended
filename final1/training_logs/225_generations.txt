###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A washing machine uses 20 gallons of water for a heavy wash, 10 gallons of water for a regular wash, and 2 gallons of water for a light wash per load of laundry. If bleach is used, there is an extra light wash cycle added to rinse the laundry thoroughly. There are two heavy washes, three regular washes, and one light wash to do. Two of the loads need to be bleached. How many gallons of water will be needed?

system
The total water consumption for the heavy washes is 20 gallons/load * 2 loads = 40 gallons.
The total water consumption for the regular washes is 10 gallons/load * 3 loads = 30 gallons.
The total water consumption for the light wash is 2 gallons/load * 1 load = 2 gallons.
Two loads need to be bleached, adding an extra light wash cycle, so the water consumption for the bleach is 2 gallons/ cycle * 1 cycle = 2 gallons.

The total water consumption for all the loads is 40 + 30 + 2 + 2 = 74 gallons.

The number of heavy washes is 2, so total water needed for the heavy washes is 2*20 = 40 gallons.
The number of regular washes is 3, so total water needed for the regular washes is 3*10 = 30 gallons.
Add the water needed for the light washes, which is 1*2 = 2 gallons.
Add the extra water needed for the bleaching, which is 2*1 = 2 gallons.
Total water needed for the laundry is 40+30+2+2 = 74 gallons.

The total water required without considering bleach usage is:
- Heavy washes: 2 × 20 = 40 gallons
- Regular washes: 3 × 10 = 30 gallons
- Light washes: 1 × 2 = 2 gallons
So, without bleach usage, the total water required is:
40 + 30 + 2 = 72 gallons.

With bleach usage, an additional light wash cycle is added for each bleach used. There are two loads that need to be bleached:
- One additional light wash cycle for the first load.
- Another additional light wash cycle for the second load.

This adds an extra 2 gallons for the first load wash and another 2 gallons for the second load wash:
2 + 2 = 4 gallons.

So, the total water required including the additional light wash cycles due to bleach usage is:
72 gallons (from the regular washes and regular cycles) + 4 gallons (for bleach usage) = 76 gallons.

The first step is to calculate the total amount of water needed for the heavy washes. Two heavy washes require 2 * 20 = 40 gallons of water.
Next, calculate the total amount of water needed for the regular washes. Three regular washes require 3 * 10 = 30 gallons of water.
Now, calculate the total amount of water needed for the light wash. One light wash requires 1 * 2 = 2 gallons of water.
Next, add the amount of water needed for the bleached loads. Two bleached loads require 2 * 2 + 2 = 6 gallons of water.
Finally, add up all the amounts of water: 40 + 30 + 2 + 6 = 78 gallons.

The first step to solving this problem would be to calculate the total gallons of water needed for the heavy washes, regular washes, and light washes. To do so, we need to multiply the number of each load type by the amount of water it uses.
Heavy washes: 2 x 20 = 40 gallons
Regular washes: 3 x 10 = 30 gallons
Light washes: 1 x 2 = 2 gallons

Next, we need to calculate the additional water needed for the bleach. Since bleach is used for two loads, we need to multiply the gallon amount by 2.
Add-on for bleach: 2 x 2 = 4 gallons

Now we can add all the water used, the additional water used for the bleach, and the number of loads to calculate the total amount of water needed.
Total: 40 + 30 + 2 + 4 + 2 x 2 = 106 gallons

For the regular and light washes, the water needed is:
- 10 gallons for a regular wash x 3 washes = 30 gallons
- 2 gallons for a light wash x 2 washes = 4 gallons

The two heavy washes use:
- 20 gallons for a heavy wash x 2 washes = 40 gallons

Adding the water needed for the bleached washes:
- 2 gallons for a heavy wash x 2 loads = 4 gallons
- 10 gallons for a regular wash x 2 loads = 20 gallons
- 2 gallons for a light wash x 2 loads = 4 gallons

In total:
- 40 gallons for regular and light washes
- 4 + 20 + 4 = 28 gallons for bleached washes
- 40 + 28 = 68 gallons total.

The heavy wash uses 20 gallons per load, so two heavy washes will use 20 gallons/load * 2 loads = 40 gallons.
The regular wash uses 10 gallons per load, so three regular washes will use 10 gallons/load * 3 loads = 30 gallons.
There is an added light wash to use with each of the two loads that need to be bleached, for a total of 2 gallons/load * 2 loads = 4 gallons.
In total, 40 gallons + 30 gallons + 4 gallons = 74 gallons of water will be needed.

For heavy washes, 20 gallons are used, so 2 × 20 = 40 gallons are used.
For regular washes, 10 gallons are used, so 3 × 10 = 30 gallons are used.
For light washes, 2 gallons are used, so 1 × 2 = 2 gallons are used.

2 of the loads need bleach, which adds another 2 × (light wash) = 4 gallons for bleaching.
