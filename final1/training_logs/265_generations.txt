###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Larry and Barry want to pick apples out of the tree, but neither is tall enough to reach the apples.  Barry can reach apples that are 5 feet high.  Larry is 5 feet tall, but his shoulder height is 20% less than his full height.  If Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, how high can they reach?

system
Barry's shoulder height is 20% less than his full height, which means his shoulder height is 80% of his full height.
Barry's full height is 5 feet, so his shoulder height is 5 feet * 0.8 = 4 feet.
If Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, they can reach a height of 5 feet + 4 feet = 9 feet.

Larry's shoulder height is 20% less than his full height, which is 5 feet. So his shoulder height is 5 - (0.20 * 5) = 4 feet. If Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, they can reach a height of 5 + 4 = 9 feet.

Larry's shoulder height is 20% less than his full height, which means it's \( 5 \times (1 - 0.20) = 4 \) feet.
If Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, they can reach \( 5 + 4 = 9 \) feet high.

Larry's shoulder height is 80% of his full height because 100 - 20 = 80
If Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, they can reach 6 feet high because 5 + (80/100)5 = 6

Larry's shoulder height is 20% less than his full height, which is 5 feet. So, 20% of 5 feet is 1 foot (since 5 * 0.20 = 1). Therefore, Larry's shoulder height is 5 feet - 1 foot = 4 feet.

Barry can reach apples that are 5 feet high. If Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, which are 4 feet high, the total height they can reach together is 4 feet + 5 feet = 9 feet.

system
Larry's shoulder height is 20% less than his full height, which is 5 feet. To find Larry's shoulder height, we calculate:
\[ \text{Larry's shoulder height} = 5 \text{ feet} - (20\% \times 5 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Larry's shoulder height} = 5 \text{ feet} - (0.20 \times 5 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Larry's shoulder height} = 5 \text{ feet} - 1 \text{ foot} \]
\[ \text{Larry's shoulder height} = 4 \text{ feet} \]

Barry can reach apples that are 5 feet high. If Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, they can reach:
\[ \text{Total height they can reach} = \text{Barry's reach} + \text{Larry's shoulder height} \]
\[ \text{Total height they can reach} = 5 \text{ feet} + 4 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Total height they can reach} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Larry's shoulder height is 20% less than his full height, which is 5 feet. To find Larry's shoulder height, we calculate:

\[ \text{Larry's shoulder height} = 5 \times (1 - 0.20) = 5 \times 0.80 = 4 \text{ feet} \]

Now, if Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, their combined height is the sum of their individual heights:

\[ \text{Combined height} = \text{Larry's shoulder height} + \text{Barry's reach} \]
\[ \text{Combined height} = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ feet} \]
