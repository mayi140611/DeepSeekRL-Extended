Kate bought 7 packs of red bouncy balls, with 18 bouncy balls per pack, which totals 7 * 18 = 126 red bouncy balls.
She also bought 6 packs of yellow bouncy balls, with 18 bouncy balls per pack, which totals 6 * 18 = 108 yellow bouncy balls.

To find how many more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls she bought, we need to subtract the total number of yellow bouncy balls from the total number of red bouncy balls: 126 - 108 = 18.

Each pack contains 18 bouncy balls, so 7 packs contain \(7 \times 18 = 126\) red bouncy balls. 6 packs contain \(6 \times 18 = 108\) yellow bouncy balls.

The difference between the number of red and yellow bouncy balls is \(126 - 108 = 18\).

First, we calculate the total number of red bouncy balls. Kate bought 7 packs of red bouncy balls, with each pack containing 18 bouncy balls. So the number of red bouncy balls is:

\[7 \times 18 = 126\]

Next, we calculate the total number of yellow bouncy balls. Kate bought 6 packs of yellow bouncy balls, with each pack containing 18 bouncy balls. So the number of yellow bouncy balls is:

\[6 \times 18 = 108\]

Now, we need to find out how many more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls were bought. We subtract the number of yellow bouncy balls from the number of red bouncy balls:

\[126 - 108 = 18\]
