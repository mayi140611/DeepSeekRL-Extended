###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Richard can clean his room in 22 minutes. Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard to clean her room while Blake can clean his room 4 minutes more quickly than Cory. If they have to clean their rooms twice a week, how many minutes do all three spend cleaning their rooms each week?

SYSTEM
Let's denote the time it takes Richard, Cory, and Blake to clean their rooms as $R$, $C$, and $B$ respectively. We know the following:

- Richard takes 22 minutes to clean his room: $R = 22$ minutes.
- Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard: $C = R + 3 = 22 + 3 = 25$ minutes.
- Blake takes 4 minutes less than Cory: $B = C - 4 = 25 - 4 = 21$ minutes.

Each of them has to clean their rooms twice a week. So, the total time they spend cleaning their rooms each week is calculated as follows:

- Richard spends $22 \times 2$ minutes each week.
- Cory spends $25 \times 2$ minutes each week.
- Blake spends $21 \times 2$ minutes each week.

Adding these together gives the total time spent cleaning their rooms each week:

$$ \text{Total Time} = (22 \times 2) + (25 \times 2) + (21 \times 2) $$

Let's calculate this total time.
</reasoning>
<answer>
Total Time = (22 \times 2) + (25 \times 2) + (21 \times 2)
            = 44 + 50 + 42
            = 136

Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard, so Cory takes \(22 + 3 = 25\) minutes to clean her room.

Blake can clean his room 4 minutes quicker than Cory, so Blake takes \(25 - 4 = 21\) minutes to clean his room.

To find the total time they each spend cleaning their rooms weekly, we multiply their individual weekly cleaning times by 2 (since they clean twice a week):

For Richard: \(22 \times 2 = 44\) minutes
For Cory: \(25 \times 2 = 50\) minutes
For Blake: \(21 \times 2 = 42\) minutes

Now, to find the total minutes spent cleaning each week by all three, we add up their weekly cleaning times:

\(44 + 50 + 42 = 136\) minutes

Therefore, all three spend 136 minutes cleaning their rooms each week.

Let's calculate the time each person takes to clean her room:

1. Richard takes 22 minutes.
2. Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard, so Cory's time is 22 + 3 = 25 minutes.
3. Blake takes 4 minutes less than Cory, so Blake's time is 25 - 4 = 21 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the total time each person takes to clean their room twice a week:

- Richard: 22 minutes per session * 2 sessions = 44 minutes per week
- Cory: 25 minutes per session * 2 sessions = 50 minutes per week
- Blake: 21 minutes per session * 2 sessions = 42 minutes per week

Finally, we'll add up all their weekly cleaning times:

- Richard's weekly cleaning time: 44 minutes
- Cory's weekly cleaning time: 50 minutes
- Blake's weekly cleaning time: 42 minutes

Total cleaning time = 44 + 50 + 42 = 136 minutes.

Therefore, all three spend a total of 136 minutes cleaning their rooms each week.

Richard takes 22 minutes to clean his room. 
Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard, so Cory takes \(22 + 3 = 25\) minutes.
Blake can clean his room 4 minutes more quickly than Cory, so Blake takes \(25 - 4 = 21\) minutes.

In one session, all three clean their rooms for \(22 + 25 + 21 = 68\) minutes.

To find out how many minutes they spend cleaning their rooms each week, we multiply the time spent cleaning for one session by the number of times they clean in a week:

First, let's determine how long it takes each person to clean their room once a week.

1. Richard takes 22 minutes. Since he has to clean his room twice a week, he spends:
\[22 \times 2 = 44 \text{ minutes}\]

2. Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard, so:
\[22 + 3 = 25 \text{ minutes}\]
Since he has to clean his room twice a week, he spends:
\[25 \times 2 = 50 \text{ minutes}\]

3. Blake can clean his room 4 minutes faster than Cory, so:
\[25 - 4 = 21 \text{ minutes}\]
Since he has to clean his room twice a week, he spends:
\[21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, let's sum up the total time spent cleaning by all three each week:
\[44 + 50 + 42 = 136 \text{ minutes}\]

To find out how many minutes Richard, Cory, and Blake spend cleaning their rooms each week, we need to first determine the time each takes to clean their rooms individually.

Richard takes 22 minutes to clean his room. Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard, so Cory takes 22 + 3 = 25 minutes. Blake takes 4 minutes less than Cory, so Blake takes 25 - 4 = 21 minutes.

Now, since all of them clean their rooms twice a week, we need to calculate the total time they spend cleaning each week.

Richard's total time for two weeks = 22 minutes/week * 2 = 44 minutes.
Cory's total time for two weeks = 25 minutes/week * 2 = 50 minutes.
Blake's total time for two weeks = 21 minutes/week * 2 = 42 minutes.

To find the total time for all three to clean their rooms each week, we add up the individual times:

Total time = Richard's total time + Cory's total time + Blake's total time
Total time = 44 + 50 + 42 = 136 minutes.

To find out how many minutes all three spend cleaning their rooms each week, we just need to add up the individual totals: 44 + 50 + 42 = 136 minutes.
Therefore, the answer is 136.
