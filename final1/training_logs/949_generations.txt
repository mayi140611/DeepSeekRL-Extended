Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of apples in one of Pam's bags:**
   - Each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags.
   - Gerald's bags contain 40 apples each.
   - Therefore, one of Pam's bags contains \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \) apples.

2. **Calculate the total number of apples Pam has:**
   - Pam has 10 bags.
   - Each of Pam's bags contains 120 apples.
   - Therefore, the total number of apples Pam has is \( 10 \times 120 = 1200 \).

**Answer:**
Pam has a total of 1200 apples.

First, we determine how many apples are in one of Pam's bags. Since each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, and each of Gerald's bags has 40 apples, one of Pam's bags contains 3 * 40 = 120 apples.

Next, we multiply the number of apples in one of Pam's bags by the total number of bags to find the total number of apples Pam has. Since Pam has 10 bags, we have 10 * 120 = 1200 apples.

To determine how many apples Pam has, we need to calculate the number of apples in each of her bags and then multiply by the number of bags she has.

First, we know that each of Pam's bags contains as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags. Since each of Gerald's bags contains 40 apples, each of Pam's bags contains:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many apples are in all of Pam's 10 bags. Since each of her bags contains 120 apples, the total number of apples Pam has is:
\[ 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, Pam has 1200 apples.

To determine the total number of apples Pam has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags.
2. Multiply the number of apples in each of Pam's bags by the total number of her bags.

First, we know that each of Gerald's bags contains 40 apples. Since each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, we calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags as follows:
\[
3 \times 40 = 120 \ \text{apples}
\]
Pam has 10 bags of apples, so we multiply the number of apples in each of Pam's bags by 10:
\[
10 \times 120 = 1200 \ \text{apples}
\]

Therefore, Pam has 1200 apples in total.

First, we need to determine how many apples are in a single of Pam's bags. We know that each of Pam's bags contains as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags and each of Gerald's bags contains 40 apples. Thus, the number of apples in Pam's bags is \(3 \times 40 = 120\).

Next, we need to find out how many apples Pam has in total by multiplying the number of apples in one of her bags by the total number of bags. As Pam has 10 bags, the total number of apples is \(10 \times 120 = 1200\).

Thus, Pam has 1200 apples.

Pam has 10 bags, and each of her bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags. Since each of Gerald's bags contains 40 apples, each of Pam's bags will contain \(3 \times 40 = 120\) apples.

Since Pam has 10 bags, the total number of apples Pam has is \(10 \times 120 = 1200\).

Therefore, Pam has 1200 apples.

First, we need to determine how many apples are in each of Pam's bags. Since each of her bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, and each of Gerald's bags has 40 apples, we can calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags as follows:

\[ \text{Apples per PAM} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we know Pam has 10 bags, each containing 120 apples. Hence, the total number of apples that Pam has can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Total apples} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \]

Therefore, Pam has 1200 apples.

To determine the total number of apples Pam has, we start by calculating the number of apples in one of Pam's bags. Since each of Pam's bags contains as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, and Gerald's bags each contain 40 apples, we have:

Number of apples in one of Pam's bags = 3 * 40 = 120 apples.

Since Pam has 10 bags, the total number of apples Pam has is:

Total apples Pam has = 10 * 120 = 1200 apples.

To determine how many apples Pam has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the number of apples in each of Pam's bags:**
   Each of Pam's bags contains as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags.

   - Gerald's bag contains \(40\) apples.
   - Therefore, each of Pam's bags contains \(3 \times 40\) apples.

   Calculate this:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120
   \]
   So, each of Pam's bags contains \(120\) apples.

2. **Calculate the total number of apples in all of Pam's bags:**
   Pam has \(10\) bags.

   Multiply the number of apples in each of her bags by the number of bags:
   \[
   10 \times 120 = 1200
   \]

Therefore, Pam has \(1200\) apples in total.
