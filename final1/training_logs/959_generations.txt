To determine how many more wings Alan must eat per minute to beat Kevin’s record, we need to find the difference between Kevin’s eating rate and Alan’s current eating rate, and then convert that difference into minutes.

Kevin's eating rate is 64 wings per 8 minutes, which means he eats \( \frac{64}{8} = 8 \) wings per minute.

Alan can currently eat 5 wings per minute. 

So, the difference in his eating rate compared to Kevin's rate is:
\[ 8 \text{ wings/minute} - 5 \text{ wings/minute} = 3 \text{ wings/minute} \]

To beat Kevin's record of 64 wings in 8 minutes, Alan needs to eat 64 wings in 8 minutes. Since he can currently eat 5 wings per minute, he needs to eat 10 minutes to eat 64 wings (since 5 wings/minute * 10 minutes = 50 wings).

Currently, Alan eats 5 wings per minute, so to eat 64 wings in 8 minutes, he needs to add:
\[ 64 \text{ wings} - (5 \text{ wings/minute} \times 10 \text{ minutes}) = 64 - 50 = 14 \text{ wings} \]

Since he currently eats 5 wings per minute, he needs to eat:
\[ \frac{14 \text{ wings}}{5 \text{ wings/minute}} = 2.8 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of additional minutes Alan needs to eat to beat Kevin’s record is:
\[ 2.8 \text{ minutes} \]

But since Alan can't eat a fraction of a minute, he needs to eat more to beat Kevin's record. Therefore, he needs to eat enough wings to cover that fractional minute. He needs to eat an additional \( \frac{1}{5} \) of a wing per minute, which is 0.2 wings or 1.6 wings per 10 minutes to cover that fractional minute.

Hence, he must eat an additional 1.6 wings per 10 minutes to beat Kevin’s record.

<reasoning>
To beat Kevin's record, Alan needs to eat more wings per minute, so we first determine how many wings he needs to eat in total per minute. 

Kevin's record is 64 wings in 8 minutes, so he eats \( \frac{64}{8} = 8 \) wings per minute. If Alan wants to eat at a higher rate, let's assume he increases his rate by \( x \) wings per minute.

To beat Kevin's record, Alan would need to eat 9 wings per minute (since \( 8 + x = 9 \) wings per minute, \( 8 + x = 9 \) wings per minute).

So, we calculate how many more wings he needs to eat to beat Kevin's record:
\[ 9 - 5 = 4 \text{ more wings per minute} \]

Thus, Alan needs to eat 4 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

To cover the additional wings per minute, Alan needs to eat at least \( \frac{4}{5} \) wings per minute, which would be the equivalent of 0.8 wings per minute, and that could be achieved by eating slightly more than \( 5 + 0.8 = 5.8 \) wings per minute to ensure he exceeds 9 wings per minute. Therefore, Alan needs to eat more than 5.8 wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

To determine how many more wings Alan needs to eat per minute to beat Kevin's record, we first need to calculate the number of wings that Kevin can eat in 8 minutes. Kevin eats 64 wings in 8 minutes, so he eats \( \frac{64}{8} = 8 \) wings per minute.

Alan wants to eat more than Kevin's recorded rate of 8 wings per minute to beat the record. Therefore, Alan needs to eat more than 8 wings per minute.

Let's denote the number of additional wings Alan needs to eat per minute to beat Kevin's record as \( x \). If Alan currently eats 5 wings per minute, after adding \( x \) wings per minute, he will eat \( 5 + x \) wings per minute.

To beat Kevin's record, Alan's eating rate must be greater than 8 wings per minute. Formulating this inequality gives us:
\[ 5 + x > 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x > 8 - 5 \]
\[ x > 3 \]

Since it's not possible for \( x \) to be greater than 3 if it is an integer, we need to interpret this in the context of needing more than 8 wings per minute. Therefore, the number of additional wings Alan needs to eat per minute to beat Kevin's record is greater than 3 wings per minute. The smallest integer greater than 3 is 4.

So, Alan needs to eat at least 4 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

To beat Kevin's record, Alan needs to eat more wings per minute than Kevin does. Kevin can eat 64 wings in 8 minutes, so he eats:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ wings}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = 8 \text{ wings per minute} \]

Alan can eat 5 wings per minute at the moment. To find out how many more wings per minute he needs to eat to beat Kevin's record, we calculate the number of wings at which he needs to eat per minute to match Kevin's total consumption over the same 8 minutes:
\[ 64 \text{ wings} = 8 \text{ wings per minute} \times 8 \text{ minutes} \]

He already eats 5 wings per minute, so we need to find out how many more wings he needs per minute:
\[ 64 \text{ wings} - 40 \text{ wings per minute} = 24 \text{ more wings per minute} \]

Therefore, Alan must eat 24 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

First, we need to determine how many wings Kevin ate per minute to hold his record. He can eat 64 wings in 8 minutes, so the calculation for his rate is:

$$
\frac{64 \text{ wings}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = 8 \text{ wings per minute}
$$

To win the contest, Alan needs to eat more than Kevin, that is, more than 8 wings per minute. Therefore, Alan needs to eat more than 8 wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

Next, to find out by how much Alan needs to increase his rate of eating wings, we subtract his current rate from Kevin's rate:

$$
8 \text{ wings per minute} - 5 \text{ wings per minute} = 3 \text{ wings per minute}
$$

Therefore, Alan needs to eat 3 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

To solve the problem, we first need to find out how many wings Alan currently can eat in 8 minutes, and then compare that to Kevin's record of 64 wings in 8 minutes.

Alan's current rate is 5 wings per minute. If we multiply this by 8 minutes, we get:
\[ 5 \text{ wings/minute} \times 8 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ wings} \]

Since Kevin holds the record at 64 wings in 8 minutes, we need to find out how many more wings Alan needs to eat per minute to surpass this number. So, we subtract the amount Alan can currently eat in 8 minutes from 64 wings:
\[ 64 \text{ wings} - 40 \text{ wings} = 24 \text{ wings} \]

This means Alan needs to eat 24 more wings in 8 minutes. To find out how many wings he needs to eat per minute, we divide the total number of wings he needs by the number of minutes:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ wings}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = 3 \text{ wings/minute} \]

So, Alan needs to eat 3 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

To beat Kevin's record, Alan needs to eat more hot wings per minute than Kevin can in 8 minutes. Kevin can eat 64 wings in 8 minutes, which means he eats 64 / 8 = 8 wings per minute.

Alan wants to eat more than 8 wings per minute to beat Kevin's record. Therefore, Alan needs to eat more than 8 wings per minute.

If Alan currently eats 5 wings per minute, he needs to eat a number greater than 8 wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

Let's calculate the difference:

8 (Kevin's current rate) - 5 (Alan's current rate) = 3 wings per minute

Alan needs to eat more than 3 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

Therefore, Alan must eat more than 3 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.
</reasoning>
<answer>
> 3
</answer>
This logic indicates that Alan needs to eat more than 3 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record of eating 64 wings in 8 minutes, but since he wants to beat it specifically, he needs to eat more than 3 more wings per minute to exceed 8 wings per minute, indicating he must eat more than 11 wings in 8 minutes to beat the record. This confirms the need to eat more than 3 more wings per minute from the given answer.

The answer is: > 3

Additionally, it's important to note that the original question's setup assumed Alan was eating at 5 wings per minute initially, but to properly address the condition of beating the record with Alan eating more wings per minute than Kevin needs, he would have to first eat more than the difference in rates than Kevin's 8 wings per minute, plus the initial rate he was given to reach 8. The answer >3 implies that to beat Kevin by more in the future, Alan needs to eat 3.75 more wings per minute than what he currently does, and given he's more than just the minimal difference, we round up, and since eating "more than" implies any amount greater than 3, and to be strict with beating the record by a little more than usual, Alan needs to eat more than 3.75 in addition to his initial 5 wings per minute current rate, which is not just a simple arithmetic of "more than" 3.75 wings, but exceeding 8 wings per minute because of the 3.75 mentioned.

To determine how many more hot wings per minute Alan needs to eat to beat Kevin's record, we need to calculate how many wings Kevin ate per minute and how many wings Alan needs to eat per minute to surpass that rate.

First, Kevin can eat 64 wings in 8 minutes. So, we calculate his consumption rate per minute as follows:
\[ \text{Kevin's rate} = \frac{64 \text{ wings}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = 8 \text{ wings per minute} \]

Alan wants to eat more wings per minute than Kevin to beat the record. Let \( x \) be the additional wings per minute Alan needs to eat. Then, his new rate would be:
\[ x + 5 \text{ wings per minute} \]

To beat Kevin's record, Alan needs to eat more wings than Kevin in the same amount of time:
\[ x + 5 > 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x > 8 - 5 \]
\[ x > 3 \]

Thus, Alan needs to eat more than 3 wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

Since Alan can currently eat 5 wings per minute, he needs to eat at least 4 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

Therefore, Alan needs to eat \( x = 4 \) more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.

To determine how many more hot wings per minute Alan must eat to beat Kevin's record, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Kevin's current eating rate by dividing the number of wings he can eat in 8 minutes by 8.
2. Calculate Alan's current eating rate by dividing the number of wings he can eat in 8 minutes by 8.
3. Determine the difference between Kevin's and Alan's eating rates.
4. Since Alan wants to beat Kevin's record, he needs to outeat Kevin's record, so he needs to increase his current eating rate by the difference calculated in step 3.

Kevin's current eating rate:
\[ \text{wings per minute} = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Alan's current eating rate:
\[ \text{wings per minute} = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

The difference between Kevin's and Alan's eating rates:
\[ \text{difference} = 8 - 8 = 0 \]

Alan needs to increase his current eating rate by the difference, which is 0 since he is currently at the same rate as Kevin. Therefore, he doesn't need to increase his rate, he needs to match Kevin's rate in terms of achieving the record.

Alan wants to eat more wings than Kevin, so he needs to eat more than his current rate, which is 8 wings per minute. To beat Kevin at this rate of 8 wings per minute, Alan needs to eat more than 8 wings per minute.

To find out how many more wings per minute he needs:
\[ \text{additional wings per minute} = 64 \]

Alan needs to eat 64 wings in 8 minutes, so his new rate should be:
\[ \text{new rate} = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Since current rate is 8, we calculate the increase needed:
\[ \text{additional 8 wings} = \text{current wings in 8 minutes} = 64 \]

Alan's new rate should be:
\[ 8 + \text{additional 8 wings per minute} = 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Alan needs to eat 8 more hot wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.
