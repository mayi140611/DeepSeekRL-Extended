###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Clarissa is responsible for getting 10 copies of a manuscript printed and having each copy bound.  The printers charge $0.05 per page to copy it and $5.00 per manuscript to have it bound.  If the manuscript is 400 pages, how much will it cost to have it copied and bound 10 times?

The cost to copy one manuscript is $0.05 per page * 400 pages = $20.00. The cost to have one manuscript bound is $5.00 The total cost to copy and bind one manuscript is $20.00 + $5.00 = $25.00. If she needs 10 copies of this manuscript, the total cost is $25.00 * 10 = $250.00

The cost to copy one manuscript is \(1000 \times 0.05 = \$50\). The cost to bind one manuscript is \$5. Therefore, the total cost for one manuscript is \(50 + 5 = \$55\).

Since she needs to copy and bind 10 copies, the total cost will be \(55 \times 10 = \$550\).

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of copying the pages and the cost of binding the manuscript separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of copying 400 pages:
Cost of copying = Number of pages × Cost per page
Cost of copying = 400 pages × $0.05/page
Cost of copying = $20

Next, let's calculate the cost of binding 10 manuscripts:
Cost of binding = Number of manuscritp × Cost of binding per manuscript
Cost of binding = 10 manuscripts × $5.00/manuscript
Cost of binding = $50

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of copying + Cost of binding
Total cost = $20 + $50
Total cost = $70

Therefore, it will cost $70 to have the manuscript copied and bound 10 times.

To calculate the cost for copying and binding the manuscript 10 times, we first calculate the cost per single manuscript and then multiply that by 10.

The cost to copy each manuscript is:
\[ 400 \text{ pages} \times \$0.05 \text{ per page} = \$20.00 \]

The cost to bind each manuscript is:
\[ \$5.00 \]

So, the total cost to copy and bind one manuscript is:
\[ \$20.00 + \$5.00 = \$25.00 \]

Now, to find the total cost for 10 copies, we multiply the cost of one manuscript by 10:
\[ 10 \times \$25.00 = \$250.00 \]

To find the total cost for copying and binding 10 manuscripts, we calculate the cost for one manuscript and then multiply by 10.

First, calculate the cost to copy one manuscript:
\[
\text{Cost of copying one manuscript} = 400 \, \text{pages} \times \$0.05/\text{page} = \$20.00
\]

Next, calculate the cost to bind one manuscript:
\[
\text{Cost of binding one manuscript} = \$5.00
\]

Then, find the total cost for one manuscript, which includes both the copy and bind costs:
\[
\text{Total cost for one manuscript} = \$20.00 + \$5.00 = \$25.00
\]

Finally, find the total cost for 10 manuscripts multiplied by the cost for one manuscript:
\[
\text{Total cost for 10 manuscripts} = 10 \times \$25.00 = \$250.00

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of copying 10 manuscripts and the cost of binding 10 manuscripts.

First, calculate the cost of copying 10 manuscripts:

\[ \text{Cost of copying} = 10 \times \text{Number of pages per manuscript} \times \text{Cost per page} \]
\[ \text{Cost of copying} = 10 \times 400 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Cost of copying} = 10 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Cost of copying} = \$200 \]

Now, calculate the cost of binding 10 manuscripts:

\[ \text{Cost of binding} = 10 \times \text{Cost to have a manuscript bound} \]
\[ \text{Cost of binding} = 10 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Cost of binding} = \$50 \]

Finally, add the cost of copying and binding to get the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of copying} + \text{Cost of binding} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 200 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$250 \]

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of copying and the cost of binding for one manuscript and then multiply by 10.

1. **Cost of copying one manuscript:**
   - There are 400 pages in the manuscript.
   - The cost to copy one page is $0.05.
   - So, the cost to copy one manuscript is \(400 \text{ pages} \times \$0.05/\text{page} = \$20.00\).

2. **Cost of binding one manuscript:**
   - The cost to bind one manuscript is $5.00.

3. **Total cost for one manuscript:**
   - Adding the cost of copying and binding, we get \( \$20.00 + \$5.00 = \$25.00\).

4. **Total cost for 10 manuscripts:**
   - Since one manuscript costs $25.00, for 10 manuscripts, the total cost is \( 10 \times \$25.00 = \$250.00\).

To find the total cost for 10 copies of a manuscript, we need to calculate the cost for copying and then for binding each copy, and then multiply by 10.

1. **Cost of copying 10 copies**: 
   Since each copy is 400 pages, the total pages for 10 copies is \(400 \times 10 = 4000\) pages.
   The cost to copy is $0.05 per page, so the total copying cost for 10 copies is \(4000 \times \$0.05 = \$200\).

2. **Cost of binding 10 copies**:
   The cost to bind one manuscript is $5.00, so the cost to bind 10 copies is \(10 \times \$5.00 = \$50\).

To find the total cost for the manuscript to be copied and bound 10 times, we need to calculate the cost for one copy separately and then multiply by 10.

First, calculate the cost for copying one manuscript:
\[ 400 \text{ pages} \times \$0.05 \text{ per page} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the cost to bind one manuscript:

Now, add these two amounts to find the total cost for one copy:
\[ \$20 + \$5 = \$25 \]

Since Clarissa needs 10 copies, multiply the cost of one copy by 10:

To find the total cost for copying and binding 10 manuscripts, we'll break this down into steps based on the charges provided.

1. **Cost to copy a manuscript:**
   - The printers charge $0.05 per page to copy it.
   - The manuscript is 400 pages.
   - Therefore, the cost to copy one manuscript is:
     \[
     400 \text{ pages} \times \$0.05 \text{ per page} = \$20
     \]

2. **Cost to bind a manuscript:**
   - The printers charge $5.00 to have a manuscript bound.
   - For one manuscript, the cost is:
     \[
     \$5.00
     \]

3. **Total cost to copy and bind one manuscript:**
   - The cost to copy one manuscript is $20.
   - The cost to bind one manuscript is $5.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for one manuscript is:
     \[
     \$20 \text{ (copying)} + \$5.00 \text{ (binding)} = \$25
     \]

4. **Total cost for 10 copies:**
   - We need to copy and bind 10 manuscripts.
   - Since the cost for one manuscript is $25, the total cost for 10 manuscripts is:
     \[
     10 \text{ manuscripts} \times \$25 \text{ per manuscript} = \$250
     \]

So, the total cost to have 10 copies of the manuscript printed and bound is $250.
