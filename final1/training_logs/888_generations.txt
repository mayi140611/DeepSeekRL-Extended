###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

An auto shop has a part that Clark needs for $80. Clark buys 7 of them and got a discount. If Clark only had to pay $439, how much was the discount?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
<reasoning>
To find out how much the discount was, we need to calculate the total cost without the discount and then subtract that from the amount Clark actually paid.

First, we determine the total cost without the discount. Clark bought 7 parts at $80 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 7 \times 80 = 560 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the discount by finding the difference between the total cost without the discount and the amount Clark actually paid:
\[ 560 - 439 = 121 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the discount was $121.

Let's calculate the total cost without the discount. Clark bought 7 parts at $80 each, so the total cost without the discount would be:

\( 7 \times 80 = $560 \)

Clark actually paid $439, which means the discount is the difference between the total cost without the discount and the amount paid:

\( $560 - $439 = $121 \)

The discount amount is $121.

To determine the discount Clark received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount for buying 7 parts.
2. Subtract the amount Clark actually paid from the calculated total cost.
3. Divide the resulting difference by the number of parts to find the discount per part.

First, the cost without the discount is:
\[ 80 \times 7 = 560 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Clark paid $439 after the discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 560 - 439 = 121 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the discount was applied equally to all 7 parts, the discount per part is:
\[ \frac{121}{7} \approx 17.29 \text{ dollars} \]

The discount itself can be calculated as $17.29 per part.

First, let's find the total amount Clark would have paid without any discount. Since he bought 7 parts at $80 each, the total cost would be:
\[ 7 \times 80 = 560 \]

Clark actually paid $439 after the discount. To find the amount of the discount, we subtract the amount he paid from the total cost:
\[ 560 - 439 = 121 \]

So, the discount was $121.

To find out how much the discount was, we need to calculate the total cost of the parts before the discount and then compare it to what Clark actually paid.

First, we calculate the total cost of the parts before the discount:
- Each part costs $80.
- Clark bought 7 parts.

Total cost before discount = 7 parts * $80/part = $560.

Clark paid $439 after the discount. 

To find the discount amount, we subtract the amount he paid from the total cost before the discount:
- Discount amount = Total cost before discount - Amount paid.

Discount amount = $560 - $439 = $121.

Therefore, the discount was $121.

To find the discount amount, we need to calculate the total cost Clark would have paid if he hadn't received the discount. Since Clark bought 7 parts at $80 each, the total cost before the discount would be $80 * 7 = $560.

Clark actually paid $439 for the 7 parts. So, the discount amount is the difference between the total cost before the discount and the amount he actually paid: $560 - $439 = $121.

Therefore, the discount amount is $121.

Let's denote the original total cost of 7 parts as \( C \). According to the problem, we know that \( C = 80 \times 7 = 560 \) dollars. Clark only paid $439 after a discount, so the total discount amount will be \( 560 - 439 \).

Now, let's calculate the discount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 560 - 439 = 121 \]

So, the discount amount is $121.

To find out how much the discount was, we need to determine the total cost of the parts without the discount and then subtract the amount Clark actually paid from that total.

1. Clark bought 7 parts at $80 each.
   - Total cost without discount = 7 parts * $80/part = $560

2. Clark paid $439 for the 7 parts after the discount.

3. The discount can be calculated by subtracting the amount paid from the total cost without discount:
   - Discount amount = Total cost without discount - Amount paid
   - Discount amount = $560 - $439 = $121

Therefore, the discount amount is $121.

Let's denote the original price per part Clark bought as \( P \). Given that the part originally cost $80 and he bought 7 parts, the total original cost would be \( 7P \). 

He got a discount off this total cost, and he actually paid $439. The discount amount would therefore be \( 7P - 439 \).

To find out how much the discount was, we need to know the original price, \( P \). Since \( 7P = 80 \times 7 \) (each part originally costs $80), we calculate the original total cost and the discount amount:
\[ 7P = 80 \times 7 = 560 \]

Now, subtract the amount Clark paid ($439) from the original total cost ($560) to find the discount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 560 - 439 = 121 \]

So, the discount was $121.

Let's denote the discount Clark received as \( D \). Clark initially needs 7 parts, and each part costs $80. Therefore, the total cost without any discount would be \( 7 \times 80 = 560 \) dollars. 

According to the problem, Clark only had to pay $439 after receiving the discount. This means the total discount \( D \) can be calculated as follows:
\[ D = 560 - 439 \]

Now we can calculate the discount:
\[ D = 560 - 439 = 121 \]

So, the discount per part is:
\[ \frac{121}{7} \]

After calculating the exact discount per part, we can add it to the original price to verify if the total cost becomes $439.

Let's calculate \( \frac{121}{7} \):
\[ \frac{121}{7} \approx 17.2857 \]

The total cost per part after discount is approximately $17.29 per part. 

Now let's calculate the total cost with the discount applied to each part:
\[ 17.29 \times 7 = 121 \]

Therefore, the discount per part is $121, and the total discount is $121.

To determine the discount, we first calculate the total cost without the discount. This is done by multiplying the price of one part by the number of parts Clark bought: 

\[ 80 \text{ dollars/part} \times 7 \text{ parts} = 560 \text{ dollars} \]

Clark paid $439, so the discount can be found by subtracting the amount paid from the total cost:

\[ 560 \text{ dollars} - 439 \text{ dollars} = 121 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the discount is $121.

To solve this problem, let's denote the original price of one part as \( P \) and the discount as \( D \). According to the problem, Clark bought 7 parts for a total of $439. The original price of one part is $80.

The equation for the total cost Clark paid is:
\[ 7 \times P - D = 439 \]
We know that the original price of one part \( P \) is $80. Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[ 7 \times 80 - D = 439 \]
\[ 560 - D = 439 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = 560 - 439 \]
\[ D = 121 \]
So, the discount was $121.

Let's denote the total cost of the parts without the discount as \(7 \times 80 = 560\). Clark paid $439 after a discount. The discount amount would be the difference between the full price and the amount Clark actually paid.

Discount amount = Full price - Amount paid
             = \(560 - 439\)

Now, let's perform the subtraction:
           \(560\)
       - \(439\)
           ______
           \(121\)
