###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Ralph is going to practice playing tennis with a tennis ball machine that shoots out tennis balls for Ralph to hit. He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?

#### ANS ####

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Reasoning:
To find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we need to calculate the number of balls he managed to hit and subtract it from the total number of balls, which is 175.

1. For the first 100 balls, 2/5 of them were hit:
   - Number of first group balls hit = 2/5 * 100 = 40
   - Number of first group balls not hit = 100 - 40 = 60

2. For the next 75 balls, 1/3 of them were hit:
   - Number of next group balls hit = 1/3 * 75 = 25
   - Number of next group balls not hit = 75 - 25 = 50

3. Total number of balls Ralph hit:
   - Total number of balls Ralph hit = 40 + 25 = 65

4. Total number of balls Ralph did not hit:
   - Total number of balls not hit = Total number of balls - Total number of balls hit
   - Total number of balls not hit = 175 - 65 = 110

Answer: Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.

To find out how many balls Ralph did not hit, we need to calculate the number of balls he hit and then subtract this from the total number of balls.

First, calculate the number of balls Ralph hit out of the first 100 balls:
\[ \text{Balls hit} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Next, calculate the number of balls Ralph hit out of the next 75 balls:
\[ \text{Balls hit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25 \]

Now add the balls hit together:
\[ \text{Total balls hit} = 40 + 25 = 65 \]

Finally, subtract the total balls hit from the total number of balls to find the number that Ralph did not hit:
\[ \text{Balls not hit} = 175 - 65 = 110 \]

Therefore, Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.

To calculate how many tennis balls Ralph didn't hit, we need to determine how many he did hit from the first 100 balls and the next 75 balls.

First, let's calculate the number of balls Ralph hit from the first 100 balls. Since he hit \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them, we have:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \text{ balls} \]

Next, for the next 75 balls, he hit \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25 \text{ balls} \]

Adding these together, the total number of balls he hit is:
\[ 40 + 25 = 65 \text{ balls} \]

He loaded 175 balls into the machine, so the number of balls he did not hit is:
\[ 175 - 65 = 110 \text{ balls} \]

Therefore, Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.

To find out how many tennis balls Ralph didn't hit, we'll calculate the number of balls he hit and subtract that from the total number of balls.

1. **Calculating the number of balls Ralph hit initially:**
   - He hit \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the first 100 balls.
   - \( 100 \) balls were hit: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \) balls.

2. **Calculating the number of balls Ralph hit in the next 75 balls:**
   - He hit \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the next 75 balls.
   - \( 75 \) balls were hit: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25 \) balls.

3. **Adding the number of balls hit in both groups:**
   - Total balls hit: \( 40 + 25 = 65 \) balls.

4. **Calculating the number of balls Ralph did not hit:**
   - Total balls: 175
   - Balls hit: 65
   - Balls not hit: \( 175 - 65 = 110 \) balls.

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Ralph didn't hit is **110**.

To find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we need to first calculate how many balls he hit and how many he missed.

1. For the first 100 balls:
   Ralph hit \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them, so:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \text{ balls}
   \]

2. For the next 75 balls:
   Ralph hit \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25 \text{ balls}
   \]

Now, let's add the number of hits from both groups:
\[
40 + 25 = 65 \text{ balls}
\]

To find out how many balls Ralph did not hit, we subtract the number of hits from the total number of balls:

\[
175 - 65 = 110 \text{ balls}
\]

Therefore, Ralph did not hit 110 balls.

The first 100 balls Ralph hit, and 2/5 of 100 is 40. So in the first 100 balls, Ralph hit 40 + 75 = 115 balls. That means 175 - 115 = 60 balls Ralph did not hit.

Answer: Ralph did not hit 60 tennis balls.

This solution is derived by first calculating how many balls Ralph hit in each set. The problem states that out of the first 100 balls, Ralph hit 2/5 of them, which equals 40 balls. This is added to the 75th batch of balls, which totals 115 balls hit when combined.

The first 100 balls, plus the next 75 balls gives a total of 175 balls. The total not hit, therefore, is the difference between the total balls and how many balls were hit.

To find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we will first calculate how many balls he hit out of the first 100 balls, then out of the next 75 balls, and finally, we will subtract the sum of these from the total number of balls to find the number of balls that he did not hit.

Out of the first 100 balls, Ralph hit 2/5 of them.
\[ \text{Number of balls hit out of the first 100} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Out of the next 75 balls, Ralph hit 1/3 of them.
\[ \text{Number of balls hit out of the next 75} = \frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of balls hit from both groups to get the total number of balls hit.
\[ \text{Total number of balls hit} = 40 + 25 = 65 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of balls hit from the original number of balls to find the number of balls that Ralph did not hit.
\[ \text{Number of balls not hit} = 175 - 65 = 110 \]

Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.

To determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we need to calculate the number of balls he missed in the first round and the second round, and then sum those numbers.

1. **Calculating the number of balls Ralph missed in the first round:**
   - He missed \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the first 100 balls since he hit \(\frac{2}{5}\) of them.
   - Number of balls missed in the first round: \(\frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60\).

2. **Calculating the number of balls Ralph missed in the second round:**
   - He missed \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the next 75 balls since he hit \(\frac{1}{3}\) of them.
   - Number of balls missed in the second round: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50\).

3. **Summing the number of balls Ralph missed in both rounds:**
   - Total number of balls missed: \(60 + 50 = 110\).

Therefore, Ralph did not hit 110 balls.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit.

1. **First 100 balls:**
   - Ralph hits \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the first 100 balls.
   - Number of balls hit = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \)
   - Number of balls not hit = \( 100 - 40 = 60 \)

2. **Next 75 balls:**
   - Ralph hits \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the next 75 balls.
   - Number of balls hit = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25 \)
   - Number of balls not hit = \( 75 - 25 = 50 \)

3. **Total balls hit:**
   - Balls hit in total = \( 40 + 25 = 65 \)

4. **Total balls not hit:**
   - Total balls = 175
   - Balls not hit = Total balls - Balls hit
   - Balls not hit = \( 175 - 65 = 110 \)

Therefore, the total number of tennis balls that Ralph did not hit is **110**.

To determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we need to calculate the number of hits he made from each batch of balls and subtract that from the total number of balls in each batch.

1. For the first 100 balls:
   Ralph hits \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \text{ hits}
   \]
   The number of balls he did not hit is:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60
   \]

2. For the next 75 balls:
   Ralph hits \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25 \text{ hits}
   \]
   The number of balls he did not hit is:
   \[
   75 - 25 = 50
   \]

3. Since all balls in the first 100 + 75 = 175 balls are part of the original 175 balls, adding the hits for the next 75 balls does not change the total number of hits or the number of balls he did not hit.

Adding up the hits for both batches:
\[
40 + 25 = 65 \text{ hits}
\]
The total number of balls is 175, so the number of balls Ralph did not hit is:
\[
175 - 65 = 110
\]

So, Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.
