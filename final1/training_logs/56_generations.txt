system
To determine how many minutes Leo spent on the third part of his assignment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the total time taken for the assignment to minutes:**
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time spent on the second part:**
   It took Leo twice as long to finish the second part as it did to finish the first part. Since the first part took him 25 minutes:
   \[
   2 \text{ parts} = 2 \times 25 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on the third part:**
   The total time taken for the assignment is 120 minutes. We already know the time spent on the first and second parts, so we subtract these from the total time:
   \[
   \text{Third part time} = 120 \text{ minutes} - 25 \text{ minutes} - 50 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the time Leo spent on the third part of the assignment is 45 minutes.

To determine how many minutes Leo spent on the third part of his assignment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent on the second part:**
   Leo spent twice as long on the second part as on the first part. The first part took him 25 minutes.
   \[
   \text{Time on second part} = 2 \times 25 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent on the first two parts:**
   Add the time spent on the first part and the second part.
   \[
   \text{Total time for first two parts} = 25 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the total time taken to finish the entire assignment:**
   The problem states that Leo finished the entire assignment in 2 hours. Convert this time into minutes.
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time spent on the third part:**
   Subtract the total time spent on the first two parts from the total time taken to finish the assignment.
   \[
   \text{Time on third part} = 120 \text{ minutes} - 75 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the number of minutes Leo spent on the third part of his assignment is \(\boxed{45}\).

To find out how many minutes Leo finished the third part of the assignment, we can first calculate the time he spent on the first and second parts and then subtract that from the total time it took him to finish the assignment.

The first part took 25 minutes.

The second part took twice as long as the first part, so it took:
25 minutes + 2 * 25 minutes = 50 minutes

The total time for the assignment is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. To find out how much time Leo spent on the third part, we subtract the time spent on the first and second parts from the total time:

120 minutes (total time) - 25 minutes (first part) - 50 minutes (second part) = 45 minutes

So, Leo spent 45 minutes finishing the third part of the assignment.

To determine how many minutes Leo finished the third part of his assignment, we first need to calculate the time he spent on each part of the assignment.

First, we know that Leo finished the first part in 25 minutes. He spent twice as long on the second part, so the time spent on the second part is:
\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the time spent on the first and second parts to find the total time spent on the first two parts:
\[ 25 + 50 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Leo finished his entire assignment in 2 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is equal to:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the time spent on the third part, we subtract the time spent on the first two parts from the total time:
\[ 120 - 75 = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the time Leo spent on the third part of his assignment is:
\[
\boxed{45}

To find out how many minutes Leo spent on the third part of his assignment, we first need to determine how long he spent on the second part.

Since the assignment was divided into three parts and he finished the first part in 25 minutes, the second part took twice as long, which means the second part took \(2 \times 25 = 50\) minutes.

Now, to find out how much time he spent on the first and second parts combined, we add the time spent on each:
\[25 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}\]

Leo finished his entire assignment in 2 hours, which is equivalent to \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

To find out how much time was spent on the third part, we subtract the time spent on the first and second parts from the total time:
\[120 \text{ minutes} - 75 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}\]

So, Leo spent 45 minutes on the third part of his assignment.

Let's break down the information given:

- Leo finished the first part in 25 minutes.
- It took him twice as long for the second part.

First, calculate the time taken for the second part:
\[
25 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Leo's total assignment is supposed to take 2 hours to complete. Let's convert this to minutes:
\[
2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, add the time taken for the first part and the second part to find out the combined time for the first two parts:
\[
25 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, subtract the combined time of the first two parts from the total time to find the time taken for the third part:
\[
120 \text{ minutes} - 75 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, Leo finished the third part of the assignment in 45 minutes.

Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Time for the first part:**
   Leo finished the first part in 25 minutes.

2. **Time for the second part:**
   It took Leo twice as long to finish the second part compared to the first part.
   - Time for the second part = 2 * 25 minutes = 50 minutes

3. **Total time for the assignment:**
   Leo finished his assignment in 2 hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

4. **Time for the third part:**
   To find the time Leo spent on the third part, we subtract the time spent on the first and second parts from the total time.
   - Time for the third part = Total time - Time for the first part - Time for the second part
   - Time for the third part = 120 minutes - 25 minutes - 50 minutes = 45 minutes.

Now, let's confirm the calculations:

- Time for the first part: 25 minutes
- Time for the second part: 50 minutes
- Total time: 120 minutes

By subtracting these:
\[ 120 - 25 - 50 = 45 \]

Therefore, the time Leo spent on the third part is 45 minutes.

To determine how long Leo spent on the third part of his assignment, we start by calculating the time he spent on each part.

First, we know that Leo finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes. Since this is stated directly:

1. Time spent on the first part = 25 minutes

Next, we are told that it took him twice as long to finish the second part. There are two parts to the problem provided but only the first part is given time, implying the problem might be misstepped or a mix-up in data. Let's assume it's meant he finished it in half the time of the next part if we continue with the initial intent:

2. Time spent on the second part = 25 minutes (half the time of the first part)

Adding the time spent on the first two parts:
3. Time spent on the first part = 25 minutes
4. Time spent on the second part = 25 minutes
5. Combined time for the first two parts = 25 + 25 = 50 minutes

The total time Leo spent on his assignment is given as 2 hours. Converting this to minutes:
6. Total time in minutes = 2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes

To find the time spent on the third part, we subtract the time spent on the first two parts from the total time:

7. Time spent on the third part = Total time - Time spent on first two parts
                            = 120 minutes - 50 minutes
                            = 70 minutes

Therefore, Leo finished the third part of his assignment in 70 minutes.

However, the stated initial setup for the second part of not being twice the time of the first part might suggest a deeper inconsistency or error in data distribution, so we might re-evaluate whether second part's time was indeed meant. Given the data provided, 70 minutes for the third part is the correct answer based on initial time given, not considering non-aligned information otherwise misleading given.

To solve this problem, let's break down the time Leo spent on each part of the assignment:

1. First part: 25 minutes
2. Second part: Twice as long as the first part, so \(2 \times 25\) minutes
3. Total time taken: 2 hours, which is \(2 \times 60\) minutes

Now, let's calculate the time for the second and third parts:

\[ \text{Second part time} = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time taken} = (25 + 50) + \text{Third part time} = 2 \times 60 \]
\[ \text{Third part time} = 2 \times 60 - (25 + 50) \]

Let's compute the value:

\[ \text{Third part time} = 2 \times 60 - 75 \]
\[ \text{Third part time} = 120 - 75 \]
\[ \text{Third part time} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]
