#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to determine how long it takes David to wash one window. Since it takes him 10 minutes to wash 4 windows, we can calculate the time per window by dividing the total time by the number of windows:
   \[
   \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ windows}} = 2.5 \text{ minutes per window}
   \]

2. Now, we know it takes David 2.5 minutes to wash one window. To find out how long it will take him to wash all 64 windows, we multiply the time per window by the total number of windows:
   \[
   2.5 \text{ minutes/window} \times 64 \text{ windows} = 160 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Therefore, it will take David 160 minutes to wash all 64 windows.

To find out how long it will take David to wash all 64 windows, we first determine how many windows he can wash in one minute. We do this by dividing the total number of windows by the number of windows he can wash in 10 minutes.

\[
\text{Windows per minute} = \frac{4 \text{ windows}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \text{ windows per minute}
\]

Next, we multiply the number of windows he can wash in one minute by the total number of windows to find out how many minutes it will take him to wash all 64 windows:

\[
\text{Total time} = 64 \text{ windows} \times 0.4 \text{ windows per minute} = 25.6 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take David 25.6 minutes to wash all of the windows.

First, we need to determine how long it takes David to wash one window. Since it takes him 10 minutes to wash 4 windows, it will take him \(10/4 = 2.5\) minutes to wash one window.

Now, we can calculate the time required to wash 64 windows by multiplying the time it takes to wash one window by the total number of windows: \(2.5 \times 64 = 160\) minutes.

First, we need to determine how long it takes David to wash one window. Since David takes 10 minutes to wash 4 windows, we can calculate the time it takes to wash one window by dividing the total time by the number of windows:

\[
\text{Time per window} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ windows}}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to wash all 64 windows. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to wash one window by the total number of windows:

\[
\text{Total time for 64 windows} = \text{Time per window} \times 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Let's calculate this.
</reasoning>
<answer>
\[
\text{Time per window} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 2.5 \text{ minutes per window}
\]

\[
\text{Total time for 64 windows} = 2.5 \text{ minutes per window} \times 64 \text{ windows} = 160 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
\text{Total time for all windows} = 160 \text{ minutes}
\]
</answer>
<reasoning>
To estimate how long it will take David to wash all the windows, we can use the following proportions and conversions:

1. First, we find out how long it takes to wash one window, given that it takes 10 minutes to wash 4 windows.
2. We then calculate the time it takes to wash one window.
3. Use this time to determine how many windows can be washed in a minute.
4. Calculate how many minutes it will take to wash all 64 windows by multiplying the time it takes to wash one window by the total number of windows.

We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. Since it takes David 10 minutes to wash 4 windows, we can calculate how long it takes to wash one window, then use that to determine how long it takes to wash 64 windows.

The proportion is: \( \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ windows}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{64 \text{ windows}} \)

Solving for \( x \), we get: \( x = \frac{10 \times 64}{4} = 160 \text{ minutes} \)

So, it will take David 160 minutes to wash all of the windows.

To find out how many minutes it will take David to wash all 64 windows, we need to first determine how many windows he can wash in one minute. Since it takes him 10 minutes to wash 4 windows, he washes \( \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5} \) of a window per minute. Therefore, we can calculate the time it takes to wash one window by taking the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \) minutes. Since there are 64 windows, the total time \( T \) required to wash all the windows is:

\[ T = 64 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, let's calculate that value.

<reasoning>
\[ T = 64 \times \frac{5}{2} = 64 \times 2.5 = 160 \]

To find out how many minutes it will take David to wash all the windows, we can set up a proportion based on the rate at which he washes the windows.

If 4 windows take 10 minutes, then 64 windows will take:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ windows}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{64 \text{ windows}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross multiply:
