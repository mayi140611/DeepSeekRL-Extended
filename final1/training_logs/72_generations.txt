To determine the amount of water in the aquarium, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total capacity of the aquarium:**
   The aquarium dimensions are 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which the aquarium is) is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Substituting the given dimensions:
   \[
   V = 4 \times 6 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the initial amount of water when Nancy fills it halfway:**
   Since Nancy fills the aquarium halfway, the amount of water is half of the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Initial water} = \frac{72}{2} = 36 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water after the cat knocks it over and spills half of it:**
   The cat spills half of the initial amount of water:
   \[
   \text{Water after spill} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water after Nancy triples it:**
   Nancy then triples the amount of water:
   \[
   \text{Final water} = 18 \times 3 = 54 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the aquarium is:
\[
\boxed{54 \text{ cubic feet}}
\]

To find out how many cubic feet of water are in the aquarium, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial volume of water in the aquarium.
2. Adjust for the spill by dividing by 2.
3. Multiply by 3 to account for Nancy's action of tripling the amount of water.

Let's go through these steps.

1. **Calculate the initial volume of water in the aquarium:**
   The formula to calculate the volume of a rectangular aquarium is:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Given the dimensions of the aquarium:
   \[
   \text{length} = 4 \text{ feet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{width} = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{height} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

   Plugging in the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 4 \times 6 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Adjust for the spill:**
   The cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half the water. Therefore, we take half of the initial volume:
   \[
   \text{Water left after spill} = \frac{72}{2} = 36 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Triple the amount of water:**
   Nancy triples the remaining amount of water:
   \[
   \text{Final volume} = 36 \times 3 = 108 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

So, the amount of water in the aquarium is 108 cubic feet.

Reasoning:

1. First, calculate the total volume of the aquarium: length x width x height = 4 feet x 6 feet x 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.
2. Nancy initially fills the aquarium halfway, so the initial amount of water is 72 cubic feet / 2 = 36 cubic feet.
3. Her cat knocks over the aquarium, spilling half of the water, so the amount of water left is 36 cubic feet / 2 = 18 cubic feet.
4. Nancy then triples the amount of water, so the final amount of water in the aquarium is 18 cubic feet x 3 = 54 cubic feet.

Answer:

There are 54 cubic feet of water in the aquarium.

To find out how much water is in the aquarium after all the described events, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total volume of the aquarium**: The aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   V = 4 \text{ ft} \times 6 \text{ ft} \times 3 \text{ ft} = 72 \text{ cubic ft}
   \]

2. **Determine the initial amount of water**: Since Nancy fills the aquarium halfway, the volume of water initially is:
   \[
   \text{Initial volume} = \frac{72 \text{ cubic ft}}{2} = 36 \text{ cubic ft}
   \]

3. **Account for the cat spilling half the water**: When the cat knocks the aquarium over, half of the water spills out. The amount of water spilled is:
   \[
   \text{Water spilled} = \frac{36 \text{ cubic ft}}{2} = 18 \text{ cubic ft}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining water after the spill**: The remaining water is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 36 \text{ cubic ft} - 18 \text{ cubic ft} = 18 \text{ cubic ft}
   \]

5. **Add back Nancy's tripled amount of water**: Nancy then triples the remaining amount of water in the aquarium. The new volume of water is:
   \[
   \text{New volume} = 18 \text{ cubic ft} \times 3 = 54 \text{ cubic ft}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of water in the aquarium after all events is:
\[
\boxed{54 \text{ cubic ft}}

To determine the volume of water in the aquarium, we need to follow the steps described in the problem:

1. Calculate the total volume of the aquarium.
2. Determine how much water is left after the cat knocks it over and spills half of it.
3. Calculate the volume of water after the cat spills some and Nancy triples it.

First, we calculate the total volume of the aquarium:
\[

Next, we find out how much water is left after the cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half of it:
\[
\text{Water left} = \frac{72}{2} = 36 \text{ cubic feet}
\]

Then, we need to determine how much water is in the aquarium after Nancy triples the amount of water left:
\[
\text{Water after tripling} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic feet}

To find the initial amount of water, we first find the volume of the aquarium. We use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
$$ \text{Volume} =\text{length} \cdot \text{width} \cdot \text{height} = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 3 = 72\text{ cubic feet} $$
We then fill the aquarium halfway, so there are 72/2 = 36 cubic feet of water in it.
The cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half the water, so there are now 36/2 = 18 cubic feet of water in the aquarium.
Now Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium, so there are 18*3 = 54 cubic feet of water in the aquarium.
Therefore, the answer is 54.

First, we need to calculate the volume of the aquarium. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given:
- Length (\( l \)) = 4 feet
- Width (\( w \)) = 6 feet
- Height (\( h \)) = 3 feet

So the volume \( V \) is:
\[ V = 4 \times 6 \times 3 \]
\[ V = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Nancy fills the aquarium halfway, so:
\[ \text{half-filling} = \frac{1}{2} \times 72 = 36 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Then her cat spills half of this water, leaving:
\[ \text{spill} = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18 \text{ cubic feet} \]

After this, Nancy triples the remaining water:
\[ \text{triple} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Therefore, the aquarium contains 54 cubic feet of water.

Let's calculate the volume of the aquarium step by step.

1. The total volume of the aquarium is calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: \( \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \).
   - The length is 4 feet.
   - The width is 6 feet.
   - The height is 3 feet.
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 4 \, \text{ft} \times 6 \, \text{ft} \times 3 \, \text{ft} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. Nancy fills the aquarium halfway, so the initial amount of water is half of its total volume:
   \[
   \text{Initial amount of water} = \frac{72}{2} = 36 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

3. The cat knocks over the aquarium, causing half of the water to spill out:
   \[
   \text{Water spilled} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]
   So, the amount of water left in the aquarium is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 36 - 18 = 18 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

4. Nancy then triples the remaining water:
   \[
   \text{Final amount of water} = 18 \times 3 = 54 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the aquarium is 54 cubic feet.

To find out how many cubic feet of water are in the aquarium after Nancy's actions, we will go through the process step by step.

1. **Initial Volume of Water:**
   The aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Substituting the dimensions:
   \[
   V = 4 \, \text{feet} \times 6 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **First Part: Nancy Fills the Aquarium Halfway:**
   Nancy fills the aquarium halfway, so:
   \[
   \text{Volume after filling halfway} = \frac{1}{2} \times 72 \, \text{cubic feet} = 36 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Cat Spills Half of the Water:**
   The cat knocks the aquarium over, spilling half of the water:
   \[
   \text{Volume after spilling half} = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 \, \text{cubic feet} = 18 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

4. **Trifolds the Amount of Water:**
   Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium:
   \[
   \text{Final Volume} = 3 \times 18 \, \text{cubic feet} = 54 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

**Summary of the Steps:**
- Initial volume: 72 cubic feet
- After filling halfway: 36 cubic feet
- After the cat spills half: 18 cubic feet
- After tripling: 54 cubic feet

Therefore:
\[
\boxed{54}
\] cubic feet of water are in the aquarium.

The aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high. The volume of the aquarium is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 4 \times 6 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 24 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Nancy fills the aquarium halfway, so we take half of the volume:

\[ \text{Half the volume} = \frac{72}{2} \]
\[ \text{Half the volume} = 36 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cat then spills half of this amount, so we calculate half of 36 cubic feet:

\[ \text{Half spilt} = \frac{36}{2} \]
\[ \text{Half spilt} = 18 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Then Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water:

\[ \text{Triple} = 18 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Triple} = 54 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Therefore, there are 54 cubic feet of water in the aquarium.
