To determine how many cups of juice were drunk, we can follow these steps:
1. Calculate the total number of cups of juice Mr. Williams bought: \(10 \text{ gallons} \times 10 \text{ cups/gallon} = 100 \text{ cups}\).
2. Subtract the number of cups left after the party: \(100 \text{ cups} - 5 \text{ cups} = 95 \text{ cups}\).
3. The number of cups drunk is equal to the total number of cups minus the number of cups left: \(95 \text{ cups} - 5 \text{ cups} = 90 \text{ cups}\).

The total number of cups of juice that were drunk is \(90\) cups.

<reasoning>
To find out how many cups of juice were drunk, we first need to determine the total amount of juice Mr. Williams bought and the amount left after the party. 

The party was attended by 10 people, and each person received 5 cups of juice. Therefore, the total amount of juice drunk is:

10 people * 5 cups/person = 50 cups

Mr. Williams bought 10 gallons of juice, with each gallon containing 10 cups, so the total amount of juice bought is:

10 gallons * 10 cups/gallon = 100 cups

The amount of juice left after the party is given as 5 cups. Therefore, the total amount of juice drunk is the difference between the total amount of juice bought and the amount left:

100 cups - 5 cups = 95 cups

So the total amount of juice drunk is 95 cups.

The party started with 10 gallons of juice, which is equivalent to 10 x 10 = 100 cups of juice. After the party, there were 5 cups of juice left. Therefore, the number of cups of juice that were drunk is 100 - 5 = 95 cups.

To determine how many cups of juice were drunk, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of juice in cups before any was drunk:
   - Mr. Williams bought 10 gallons of juice.
   - Each gallon has 10 cups.
   - Therefore, the total amount of juice is \( 10 \text{ gallons} \times 10 \text{ cups/gallon} = 100 \text{ cups} \).

2. Subtract the number of cups left after the party:
   - At the end of the party, 5 cups of juice were left.
   - Therefore, the number of cups drunk is \( 100 \text{ cups} - 5 \text{ cups} = 95 \text{ cups} \).

So, the number of cups of juice that were drunk is 95.

To find out how many cups of juice were drunk, we need to first determine how many cups of juice Mr. Williams had initially and then subtract the amount that was left.

Mr. Williams bought 10 gallons of juice, and each gallon contains 10 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups he had initially is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 10 \text{ cups/gallon} = 100 \text{ cups} \]

At the end of the party, 5 cups of juice were left. To find out how many cups were drunk, we subtract the leftover juice from the total amount of juice:
\[ 100 \text{ cups} - 5 \text{ cups} = 95 \text{ cups} \]

So, 95 cups of juice were drunk.

Mr. Williams bought 10 gallons of juice for the party. Each gallon contains 10 cups of juice, which results in a total of \( 10 \text{ gallons} \times 10 \text{ cups/gallon} = 100 \text{ cups} \). After the party, at least \( 5 \text{ cups} \) of juice remained.

The total amount of juice drunk is the difference between the initial total and the amount left after the party.
\[ \text{Juice drunk} = 100 \text{ cups} - 5 \text{ cups} = 95 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Mr. Williams drank 95 cups of juice.
