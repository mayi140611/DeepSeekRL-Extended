###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

system
Betty initially needs $100 for the wallet.

Since she has only half of it, she currently has:
\[ \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Her parents give her $15, so now she has:
\[ 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, so:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to what she already has:
\[ 65 + 30 = 95 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money Betty needs, we subtract what she has from the total cost of the wallet:
\[ 100 - 95 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Betty still needs $5 more to buy the wallet.

Betty needs to save $100 for the wallet, but she has only half of that, which is $50. Her parents give her $15, and her grandparents give her twice $15, which is $30. So, the total amount of money Betty has is $50 (her savings) + $15 (parents) + $30 (grandparents) = $95. The wallet costs $100, so Betty needs $100 - $95 = $5 more to buy the wallet.

Betty needs $100 but has only half of the money she needs, so she has $100 / 2 = $50. Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which is $15 x 2 = $30. The total amount her parents and grandparents gave her is $15 + $30 = $45. Therefore, Betty still needs $100 - $50 - $45 = $5.

Betty needs $100 for the wallet.
Half of the amount Betty needs is $100 / 2 = $50.
Her grandparents decided to give Betty twice as much as her parents, which is 2 * $15 = $30.
So, Betty needs $50 ($100 - $50 she already has) + $30 ($30 from her grandparents - $15 from her parents) = $80.

Given that Betty's parents gave her $15 and her grandparents gave her two times as much as her parents, how much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total cost of the wallet**: The wallet costs $100.

2. **Calculate Betty's current savings**: Since Betty has only half of the money she needs, we calculate her current savings as follows:
   \[
   \text{Betty's current savings} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the money given by Betty's parents**: Her parents gave her $15.

4. **Determine the money given by Betty's grandparents**: Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so:
   \[
   \text{Money given by grandparents} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Betty now has**: Add the amount from her parents and grandparents to her current savings:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 50 + 15 + 30 = 95 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Determine how much more money Betty needs**: Subtract the total amount she now has from the total cost of the wallet:
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 100 - 95 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Betty still needs $5 more to buy the wallet.

Betty needs $100, and she already has half of it, which is $100/2 = $50.

Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so they gave her $15 x 2 = $30.

So far, Betty has $50 + $15 + $30 = $95.

The cost of the wallet is $100, so Betty still needs $100 - $95 = $5.

Therefore, the answer is 5.

Betty initially saves half of $100, which is $50. Her parents give her $15. Her grandparents give twice the amount her parents gave, which is $15 \times 2 = $30. So in total, Betty has $50 (initial savings) + $15 (from parents) + $30 (from grandparents) = $95.

To find out how much more money Betty needs, we subtract the total she has from the cost of the wallet: $100 - $95 = $5.

Betty needs to save up $100 for the wallet. We know that Betty already has half of this amount, so we calculate the initial amount she has as follows:

\[ \text{Initial amount} = \frac{100}{2} = \$50 \]

Her parents give her $15:

\[ \text{Money from parents} = 15 \]

Her grandparents give her twice this amount:

\[ \text{Money from grandparents} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount Betty received:

\[ \text{Total received} = 50 + 15 + 30 = \$95 \]

The wallet costs $100, so the amount still needed is:

\[ \text{Additional needed} = 100 - 95 = \$5 \]

Therefore, Betty still needs to save \$5 more to buy the wallet.

The amount still needed for Betty to buy the wallet is \$5.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Betty needs a total of $100 for the wallet.
2. Betty currently has only half of the money she needs, which means she has $100 / 2 = $50.
3. Her parents gave her $15.
4. Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Betty has after receiving gifts from her parents and grandparents:
- Total from parents: $15
- Total from grandparents: $30
- Total received from parents and grandparents: $15 + $30 = $45

Adding this amount to the $50 Betty already had:
- Betty's total with gifts: $50 + $45 = $95

To find out how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet:
- Amount needed: $100
- Amount already has: $95
- Amount still needed: $100 - $95 = $5

Therefore, Betty still needs $5 to buy the wallet.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Betty needs a total of $100 for the wallet.

Step 1: Determine how much Betty currently has.
Betty has only half of the money she needs.
$$
\text{Amount Betty has} = \frac{100}{2} = \$50
$$

Step 2: Calculate how much money Betty's parents will give her.
Her parents gave her $15.
$$
\text{Amount from parents} = \$15
$$

Step 3: Calculate how much money Betty's grandparents will give her.
Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents.
$$
\text{Amount from grandparents} = 2 \times \$15 = \$30
$$

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Betty will have after receiving money from her parents and grandparents.
$$
\text{Total money Betty will have} = \$50 + \$15 + \$30 = \$95
$$

Step 5: Determine how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet.
$$
\text{Amount still needed} = \$100 - \$95 = \$5
$$

Therefore, Betty still needs \$5 to buy the wallet.

Betty needs $100. She has half of that, which means she has $100/2 = $50. Her parents gave her $15, so she now has $50 + $15 = $65. Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which is $15 \times 2 = $30. Adding this to Betty's current amount, she has $65 + $30 = $95. The wallet costs $100, so Betty still needs $100 - $95 = $5.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Betty needs a total of $100 for the wallet.
2. Betty already has half the amount she needs, which is \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) dollars.
3. Her parents gave her $15.
4. Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which is \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Betty has:

- Betty's current savings: $50
- Money from parents: $15
- Money from grandparents: $30

Total savings = $50 (Betty's savings) + $15 (parents) + $30 (grandparents) = $95.

To find out how much more money Betty needs, we subtract her total savings from the total cost of the wallet:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total savings
Amount needed = $100 - $95

Now, let's calculate the amount Betty needs:

- Calculation for the remaining amount = $100 - $95 = $5.

However, the question seems to have mistaken the total cost for the wallet as $200 in the final step, which is not the correct total cost of the wallet.

Apologies for the confusion, let's proceed with the correct total cost of $100:

- Correct calculation for the remaining amount = $100 - $95 = $5.

Betty needs $5 more to buy the wallet.

To determine how much more money Betty needs, we start by calculating how much money she currently has. Since the wallet costs $100 and Betty has only half of the money she needs, she currently has $50 (because $100 / 2 = $50).

Next, we account for the money her parents will give her. Her parents will give her $15. Adding this to the $50 she already has:

$50 (current savings) + $15 (from parents) = $65

Then, we determine how much money her grandparents will give her. Her grandparents will give her twice as much as her parents, so:

$15 (parents) × 2 = $30

Adding this to the $65 she already has:

$65 (current total) + $30 (from grandparents) = $95

Now we compare the total amount of money Betty has to the cost of the wallet:

$95 (total savings) - $100 (cost of wallet) = -$5

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Betty has saved $5 more than she needs. Therefore, Betty has $5 more than the cost of the wallet.

To find out how much more money Betty needs:

$100 (cost of wallet) - $95 (total savings) = $5

Therefore, Betty already has more than enough money to buy the wallet and needs no additional funds.
