###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

system
<reasoning>
First, let's calculate the total number of trays baked in 6 days:
2 trays/day * 6 days = 12 trays

Each tray makes 12 cookies, so total cookies baked:
12 trays * 12 cookies/tray = 144 cookies

Frank eats 1 cookie per day for 6 days, so he eats a total of:
1 cookie/day * 6 days = 6 cookies

Ted eats 4 cookies on the sixth day.

Total cookies consumed by Frank and Ted:
6 cookies (Frank) + 4 cookies (Ted) = 10 cookies

Now, subtract the total cookies eaten from the total cookies baked to find out how many cookies are left:
144 cookies - 10 cookies = 134 cookies

So, there are 134 cookies left when Ted leaves.

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine the total number of cookies Frank bakes. Frank bakes two trays per day for 6 days, and each tray makes 12 cookies. So, the total number of cookies baked is:
\[ 2 \text{ trays/day} \times 12 \text{ cookies/tray} \times 6 \text{ days} = 144 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to account for the cookies Frank eats. Frank eats one cookie each day for 6 days. So the total number of cookies Frank eats is:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies available by the end of the sixth day is:
\[ 144 \text{ cookies} - 6 \text{ cookies} = 138 \text{ cookies} \]

On the sixth day, Ted eats 4 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left when Ted leaves is:
\[ 138 \text{ cookies} - 4 \text{ cookies} = 134 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the number of cookies left when Ted leaves is 134.

Frank bakes 2 trays of cookies per day, which makes 2 * 12 = 24 cookies per day. Over the course of 6 days, he bakes 24 * 6 = 144 cookies.
Frank eats 1 cookie per day, so he eats 6 * 1 = 6 cookies in total over the 6 days. Ted eats 4 cookies on the sixth day.
Frank started with 144 cookies and ate 6, leaving 144 - 6 = 138 cookies. Ted then ate 4 cookies, leaving 138 - 4 = 134 cookies.
The final number of cookies left is 134.

Frank bakes a total of:
2 trays/day * 6 days = 12 trays of cookies.

He eats one cookies per day, for 6 days, so:
2 trays * 12 cookies/tray * 6 days = 144 cookies eaten.

Ted comes over on the sixth day and eats 4 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:
144 cookies - 4 cookies eaten by Ted = 140 cookies.

Therefore, there are 140 cookies left when Ted leaves.

Frank bakes \(2 \text{ trays/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ trays}\) of cookies.
Each tray makes 12 cookies, so 12 trays make \(12 \text{ trays} \times 12 \text{ cookies/tray} = 144 \text{ cookies}\).

Frank eats one cookie per day for 6 days, so he eats \(1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ cookies}\).
Ted eats 4 cookies on the sixth day.

Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten is \(6 \text{ (Frank's cookies)} + 4 \text{ (Ted's cookies)} = 10 \text{ cookies}\).

The total number of cookies left when Ted leaves is \(144 \text{ cookies} - 10 \text{ cookies eaten} = 134 \text{ cookies}\).

First, calculate the total number of cookies Frank bakes. He bakes 2 trays per day for 6 days, and each tray makes 12 cookies. So, the total number of cookies baked is \( 2 \times 12 \times 6 = 144 \) cookies.

Next, account for the cookies Frank eats. He eats 1 cookie per day for 6 days, so that's \( 1 \times 6 = 6 \) cookies.

On the sixth day, Ted eats 4 cookies.

Now, subtract the cookies eaten by Frank and Ted from the total number of cookies baked:
\( 144 - 6 - 4 = 134 \) cookies are left when Ted leaves.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Frank bakes cookies for 6 days. Since he bakes two trays each day, he bakes a total of 6 trays per day.
2. Each tray makes 12 cookies. So, Frank bakes a total of 6 * 12 = 72 cookies.
3. Frank eats one cookie each day for 6 days. That's a total of 6 cookies eaten by Frank.
4. On the sixth day, Ted comes over and eats 4 cookies. This means 4 more cookies are eaten.
5. To find the total number of cookies eaten by Frank and Ted, we add the number of cookies eaten by Frank (6) and the number of cookies eaten by Ted (4). This gives us 6 + 4 = 10 cookies eaten in total.
6. Subtract the total number of cookies eaten (10) from the total number of cookies baked (72) to find out how many cookies are left. This is 72 - 10 = 62 cookies left.

So, there are 62 cookies left when Ted leaves.

Frank bakes two trays of cookies per day for 6 days, so he bakes a total of 2 trays/day * 6 days = 12 trays.
Each tray makes 12 cookies, so he bakes a total of 12 trays * 12 cookies/tray = 144 cookies.
Frank eats one cookie each day over the 6 days, so he eats a total of 1 cookie/day * 6 days = 6 cookies.
On the sixth day, Ted comes over and eats 4 cookies.
So, the total number of cookies eaten is 6 (Frank's cookies) + 4 (Ted's cookies) = 10 cookies.
Therefore, the total number of cookies left is 144 (total baked) - 10 (total eaten) = 134 cookies.

To determine how many cookies are left when Ted leaves, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies baked in 6 days.
2. Subtract the number of cookies Frank eats over 6 days.
3. Subtract the 4 cookies Ted eats on the sixth day.
4. Finally, divide the remaining number by 2 because each tray makes 12 cookies.

1. The total number of cookies baked in 6 days:
\[ 2 \text{ trays/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ trays} \]

2. Frank eats 1 cookie each day, so in 6 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ cookies} \]

3. After Frank eats, the remaining number of cookies:
\[ 12 \text{ trays} \times 12 \text{ cookies/tray} - 6 \text{ cookies} = 144 \text{ cookies} - 6 \text{ cookies} = 138 \text{ cookies} \]

4. After Frank and Ted eat, the remaining number of cookies:
\[ 138 \text{ cookies} - 4 \text{ cookies} = 134 \text{ cookies} \]

Since each tray makes 12 cookies, the number of trays left:
\[ \frac{134 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/tray}} \approx 11 \text{ trays} \]

So, the number of cookies left when Ted leaves is \( 134 \).
