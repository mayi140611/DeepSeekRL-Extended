#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
First, let's calculate the total amount of money Chad made this year:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from mowing yards} + \text{Money from birthday/holidays} + \text{Money from selling video games} + \text{Money from odd jobs} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 600 + 250 + 150 + 150 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 1150 \]

Chad saves 40% of his total earnings. To calculate his savings, we multiply the total earnings by 40%:

\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Total earnings} \times 0.40 \]

\[ \text{Savings} = 1150 \times 0.40 \]

\[ \text{Savings} = 460 \]

Therefore, Chad will save $460.

First, let's find out how much money Chad earned/received in total for the year. He made $600 mowing yards, $250.00 for his birthday/holidays, $150.00 by selling old video games, and another $150.00 doing odd jobs. 

Total earnings/receipts = $600 + $250.00 + $150.00 + $150.00 = $1,150.00

Now, we know that Chad saves 40% of the money he earns. To find out how much he will save, we multiply the total earnings by 40%.

Amount saved = 40% of $1,150.00
              = 0.40 * $1,150.00
              = $460.00

To determine how much Chad will save, we need to first calculate his total earnings and then find out how much he saves from those earnings. He earns money from mowing yards, receiving money for his birthday/holidays, selling old video games, and doing odd jobs.

First, let's list his earnings:
- $600 from mowing yards
- $250 from birthday/holiday gifts
- $150 from selling old video games
- $150 from odd jobs

Next, we add these amounts to find his total earnings:
\[ 600 + 250 + 150 + 150 = 1150 \]

Chad saves 40% of his total earnings. To find out how much he saves, we calculate 40% of $1150:
\[ 0.40 \times 1150 = 460 \]

So, Chad will save $460.

To calculate how much Chad will save, we first need to determine his total earnings for the year. We do this by adding up all the money he made:

- Money from mowing yards: $600
- Money from birthday/holidays: $250
- Money from selling old video games: $150

Savings = 0.40 * Total earnings
Savings = 0.40 * $1150
Savings = $460

So, Chad will save $460.

First, we need to calculate Chad's total earnings for the year. He made money from mowing yards, received money for his birthday/holidays, sold video games, and did odd jobs. 

Total earnings = Earnings from mowing yards + Received from birthday/holidays + Earnings from selling video games + Earnings from odd jobs
Total earnings = $600 + $250 + $150 + $150
Total earnings = $1,200

Next, we need to calculate how much Chad saves. He saves 40% of his total earnings.

Savings = Total earnings * Savings percentage
Savings = $1,200 * 40%
Savings = $1,200 * 0.4
Savings = $480

To determine how much Chad will save, we first need to calculate his total earnings and the amount he wants to save.

1. Calculate Chad's total earnings:
   - Earnings from mowing yards: $600.00
   - Earnings from birthday/holidays: $250.00
   - Earnings from selling video games: $150.00
   - Earnings from odd jobs: $150.00
   - Total earnings = $600.00 + $250.00 + $150.00 + $150.00 = $1150.00

2. Calculate the amount Chad will save:
   - Chad saves 40% of his total earnings.
   - Savings = 40% of $1150.00 = 0.40 * $1150.00 = $460.00

3. Subtract the amount he spends from his total earnings:
   - Total earnings = $1150.00
   - Amount spent on miscellaneous expenses = $250.00
   - Amount saved = Total earnings - Amount spent = $1150.00 - $250.00 = $850.00
