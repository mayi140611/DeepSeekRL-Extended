Let's denote the amount of practice Johnny has currently as \( P \). According to the problem, 20 days ago, Johnny had half as much practice as he has currently, so he had \( \frac{P}{2} \) practice 20 days ago.

Given that Johnny practices the same amount each day, let's denote the amount of practice per day as \( D \). Therefore, in \( 20 \) days, Johnny has practiced \( 20D \) and by 20 days ago, he had practiced \( 20D - 20D = 0 \) additional days of practice in the past, which is negligible since he hasn't been practicing for exactly 20 days at that point.

Let's denote \( T \) as the total time since he started practicing, and \( T + 20 \) as the current time as he practices today. So, now Johnny has practiced \( (T + 20)D \) and will practice \( TD \) days into the future.

The problem states that Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he currently has (let's call this \( 3P \)) after some days. This means \( 3P = PD \), because since \( P \) is his current practice, and he will keep practicing \( D \) every day he does, \( 3P = DP \), which simplifies to \( P = 3D \).

Given that he has practiced \( 20D \) days ago, the total time \( T \) is \( 20 \) days less than the current time \( T + 20 \). So,
\[ T + 20 = 2T. \]
This simplifies to
\[ T = 20. \]
This means 20 days ago Johnny had practiced \( 20D \) and will continue to practice \( D \) days every day he practices today until he has 3 times as much practice as he currently has.

The number of days from now when Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he currently has is therefore \( 30 - 20 = 10 \) days.

Let's denote the amount of practice Johnny has today as \( P \). According to the problem, 20 days ago, he had half of that, which means he had \( \frac{P}{2} \). The difference in practice between today and 20 days ago is \( P - \frac{P}{2} = \frac{P}{2} \). This represents the same amount he practices each day. We need to find out how many more days (\( x \)) it will take until he has 3 times as much practice as he does today.

We can set up the equation for the practice over some number of days:
\[ \text{Practice} = P + x \cdot \frac{P}{2} \]
We want to solve for \( x \) such that the practice becomes 3 times \( P \). So we set up the equation:
\[ 3P = P + x \cdot \frac{P}{2} \]
Subtract \( P \) from both sides:
\[ 2P = x \cdot \frac{P}{2} \]
Divide both sides by \( P \) (assuming \( P \neq 0 \)):
\[ 2 = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} \]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 4 = x \]
So, \( x = 4 \).

This means that in 4 more days, Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he currently has.

Let's denote the amount Johnny has had practice in the past 20 days as \(P\). According to the problem, as of 20 days ago, he had half as much practice as he does currently. This means he has \(2P\) practice currently. He practices the same amount each day, so in the same 20 days, he practices \(20d\), where \(d\) is the amount he practices each day. Hence, we can express the current amount of practice as:
\[20d = 2P \implies P = 10d\]

We need to find out after how many days he will have 3 times as much practice as he does currently. Let this number of days be \(x\) days after the current date. In \(x\) days, he will have practiced \(xd\) more, making his total practice amount \(20d + xd = (20 + x)d\). According to the problem, this total amount will be 3 times the current amount of practice:

\[(20 + x)d = 3 \cdot 20d\]

Dividing both sides by \(d\) (assuming \(d \neq 0\)), we get:

\[20 + x = 60\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = 60 - 20\]
\[x = 40\]

So, in 40 days from now, Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he has currently.

Let's denote the amount of practice Johnny has today as \( P \). According to the problem, 20 days ago, Johnny had half as much practice as he has currently, so he had \( \frac{P}{2} \).

This implies:
\[ P - 20 = \frac{P}{2} \]

By solving this equation, we can find \( P \). First, multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2(P - 20) = P \]
\[ 2P - 40 = P \]
\[ 2P - P = 40 \]
\[ P = 40 \]

So Johnny has 40 days of practice.

Now, we are asked how many days will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he has today. That would be:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Thus, to increase his practice by 120 days, he needs to practice:
\[ 120 - 40 = 80 \]

So, 80 days will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he does currently.

Let's denote the current amount of practice Johnny has as \( P \). According to the problem, 20 days ago, Johnny had half of this amount, which means he had \( \frac{P}{2} \). The amount of practice he has now is \( P \), and we need to find out after how many days he will have \( 3P \).

Let's denote the number of days that will pass as \( d \). In \( d \) days, Johnny practices \( d \) times the amount he practices each day. So, his current amount of practice is \( P = \frac{d}{20}(P - \frac{P}{2}) + \frac{d}{20} \cdot \frac{P}{2} \).

Simplifying the equation:
\[ P = \frac{d}{20}P - \frac{dP}{40} + \frac{dP}{40} \]
\[ P = \frac{d}{20}P \]

Dividing both sides by \( P \):
\[ 1 = \frac{d}{20} \]

Solving for \( d \):
\[ d = 20 \]

Therefore, 20 days will pass before Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he currently has.

Let's denote the number of days Johnny has been playing guitar as \( x \). Currently, he has practiced \( x \) days ago. If he practices the same amount each day, the number of days he will take to have 3 times as much practice as he currently has is \( y \) days.

Since 20 days ago he had half as much practice as he currently does, the difference in days since he had half as much practice is 20 days, meaning he has been playing for \( x + 20 \) days.

The number of ways he has been playing for is a multiple of the base he started from, i.e., \( x + 20 \). In terms of his current practice amount, the difference of practice is:

\[ 3x - x = 2x \]

This difference of practice occurs over \( y \) days. Since he practices the same amount each day, \( y \) days of this practice translate to \( 2x \) days of current practice. Therefore, \( y \) needs to be twice the number of days since he had half as much practice, which means \( y = 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Therefore, it will take 40 days for Johnny to have 3 times as much practice as he currently has.

Let's denote the total amount of practice Johnny has currently as \( P \).

20 days ago, Johnny had half as much practice as he does currently. Therefore, he had \( \frac{P}{2} \) practice 20 days ago.

Since he practices the same amount each day, let's denote the amount of practice he practices each day as \( d \).

The total amount of practice he has practiced since 20 days ago is the number of days he practiced multiplied by his daily practice amount:

\[ \text{Total practice since 20 days ago} = 20d \]

So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{P}{2} = 20d \]

Solving for \( d \) gives:

\[ d = \frac{P}{40} \]

Now, Johnny wants to have 3 times as much practice as he currently has. This amount is \( 3P \).

The amount of practice he will have in the future (letâ€™s call this \( P_{future} \)) can be expressed as:

\[ P_{future} = 20d + (d \times \text{number of days until 3 times practice}) \]

Since \( P_{future} = 3P \) and \( 20d = \frac{P}{2} \), we substitute:

\[ 20d + (d \times \text{number of days until 3 times practice}) = 3P \]

Substitute \( d \):

\[ \frac{P}{2} + \left(\frac{P}{40} \times \text{number of days until 3 times practice}\right) = 3P \]

Solving for the number of days until 3 times practice:

\[ \frac{P}{40} \times \text{number of days until 3 times practice} = 3P - \frac{P}{2} \]

\[ \frac{P}{40} \times \text{number of days until 3 times practice} = \frac{5P - P}{2} \]

\[ \frac{P}{40} \times \text{number of days until 3 times practice} = \frac{4P}{2} \]

\[ \frac{P}{40} \times \text{number of days until 3 times practice} = 2P \]

\[ \text{number of days until 3 times practice} = 2 \times 40 \]

\[ \text{number of days until 3 times practice} = 80 \]

Therefore, 80 days will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he does currently.

Let's denote the amount of practice Johnny has as \( P \) and the amount he practices each day as \( d \).

Given that 20 days ago he had half of his current practice:
\[ P - 20d = \frac{1}{2}P \]

This simplifies to:
\[ P - 20d = \frac{1}{2}P \]
\[ P - \frac{1}{2}P = 20d \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}P = 20d \]
\[ P = 40d \]

So, Johnny currently has 40 times his daily practice amount.

We want to find out how many days will pass (let's call this \( x \)) before he has 3 times his current amount of practice:
\[ P + xd = 3P \]

Substitute \( P = 40d \) into the equation:
\[ 40d + xd = 3(40d) \]
\[ 40d + xd = 120d \]
\[ d(x + 40) = 120d \]
\[ x + 40 = 120 \]
\[ x = 120 - 40 \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, 80 days will pass before Johnny has 3 times his current amount of practice.

Let's denote the current amount of practice Johnny has as \( P \). According to the problem, 20 days ago, he had half as much practice as he has currently, so that means he had \( \frac{P}{2} \) days ago.

Johnny practices the same amount each day, so the daily practice amount can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Daily practice} = \frac{P - \frac{P}{2}}{20} = \frac{\frac{P}{2}}{20} = \frac{P}{40} \]

We want to find out when Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he does currently, which is \( 3P \).

The time it will take for Johnny to have 3 times as much practice as he does currently can be calculated by dividing the difference in practice by his daily practice amount:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{3P - P}{\frac{P}{40}} = \frac{2P}{\frac{P}{40}} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ days} \]

So, 80 days will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he does currently.

Let's denote Johnny's current practice amount as \( P \). According to the problem, 20 days ago, Johnny had half of his current practice. So, 20 days ago, he had \( \frac{P}{2} \). 

Let's say Johnny practices \( d \) days a week. So, in 20 days, he has practiced \( 20d \) days. If we let \( x \) be the number of days before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he does currently, then in \( x \) days he will have practiced \( xd \) days.

In \( x + 20 \) days, Johnny will have practiced \( xd + 20d \). At this time, Johnny will have practiced \( x + 20 \) times as much as he did 20 days ago, which is \( (x + 20)d \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 20)d = 3P \]
\[ xd + 20d = 3P \]

We also know that 20 days ago, Johnny had half as much practice as he does now, which means:
\[ 20d = \frac{P}{2} \]
\[ d = \frac{P}{40} \]

Substituting \( d \) into the equation:
\[ x \left( \frac{P}{40} \right) + 20 \left( \frac{P}{40} \right) = 3P \]
\[ \frac{xP}{40} + \frac{20P}{40} = 3P \]
\[ \frac{xP + 20P}{40} = 3P \]
\[ \frac{(x + 20)P}{40} = 3P \]
\[ x + 20 = 120 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, 100 days will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he does currently.

Let's denote the amount of practice Johnny has currently as \( P \). According to the information given, 20 days ago, he had half as much practice as he has currently, so he had \( \frac{P}{2} \) days ago. 

If he practices the same amount each day, let the daily practice amount be \( d \). Then, we can express his current practice as:
\[ P = 20d. \]

His practice 20 days ago was:
\[ \frac{P}{2} = \frac{20d}{2} = 10d. \]

We need to find \( d \) by substituting \( P = 20d \) back into the equation:

Let's denote the amount of practice Johnny has today as \( P \). According to the information given, 20 days ago, he had half as much practice as he does currently. So, 20 days ago, he had \( \frac{P}{2} \).

Since Johnny practices the same amount every day, he has been practicing for 20 days. Therefore, the total amount of practice he has now is \( P \) and the total amount of practice he has had in the last 20 days is \( 20P \).

The total amount of practice Johnny has had so far is equal to the amount he has today plus the amount he had 20 days ago. This can be written as:
\[ P = \frac{P}{2} + 20P \]

Let's solve this equation to find \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{P}{2} + 20P \]
\[ P = 20P + \frac{P}{2} \]
\[ P - 20P - \frac{P}{2} = 0 \]
\[ -20P - \frac{P}{2} = 0 \]
\[ -40P - P = 0 \]
\[ -41P = 0 \]
\[ P = 0 \]

This result seems incorrect because Johnny should have some amount of practice. Let's re-evaluate the equation by removing the fractions and simplifying properly:
\[ P = \frac{P}{2} + 20P \]
\[ P = \frac{P}{2} + \frac{40P}{2} \]
\[ P = \frac{P + 80P}{2} \]
\[ P = \frac{81P}{2} \]
\[ 2P = 81P \]
\[ 2P = 81P \]
\[ 2P - 81P = 0 \]
\[ -79P = 0 \]
\[ P = 40 \]

So Johnny has 40 units of practice today.

Now, we want to find out how many days will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he currently has, i.e., \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \) units.

Since he currently has 40 units of practice, the number of days it will take him to have 120 units of practice is:
\[ \frac{120}{40} = 3 \]

Therefore, three days will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he does currently.

Let's denote the amount of practice Johnny has currently as \( P \).

According to the information given, 20 days ago, Johnny had half as much practice as he does currently. So, 20 days ago, he had \( \frac{P}{2} \).

Johnny practices the same amount each day. Therefore, the amount of practice he gains each day is constant.

Now, we want to find out how many days pass before Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he currently has. That would be \( 3P \).

Since the amount he practices each day is constant, the number of additional days before he has 3 times as much practice as he does currently will be the same as the number of days he has until he gains the remaining amount of practice to reach 3 times as much as he does currently.

So, \( 3P - P = 2P \).

If Johnny has gained \( \frac{P}{2} \) in the last 20 days, the remaining amount to reach 3 times as much practice as he currently has is \( 3P - \frac{P}{2} = \frac{6P - P}{2} = \frac{5P}{2} \).

Since Johnny practices the same amount each day, the number of days required to gain \( \frac{5P}{2} \) will be \( \frac{5P}{2} \div \frac{P}{2} = 5 \).

Therefore, 5 days will pass before Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he currently has.

Let's denote the number of days Johnny has been playing guitar as \( D \) and the number of days until Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he currently has as \( T \). We know that Johnny has been playing for exactly \( D \) days.

According to the problem, 20 days ago, Johnny had half as much practice as he does currently. This means that 20 days ago, he had \( \frac{D-20}{2} \) days of practice.

Since Johnny practices equally each day, the amount of practice he has is proportional by the number of days he has practiced. Therefore, the amount of practice he has today is the same as what he had 20 days ago.

So, Johnny currently practices for \( \frac{D-20}{2} \) days per day, and the total practice is given by the equation:
\[ 20 \times \frac{D-20}{2} = D \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:
\[ 20(D - 20) = 2D \]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 20D - 400 = 2D \]
\[ 18D = 400 \]
\[ D = \frac{400}{18} \]
\[ D = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22 \]

Next, for Johnny to have 3 times as much practice as he currently has, the number of days until he has achieved that will be \( T \). At that point, he will have practiced for \( \frac{D - 20T}{2} \) days per day, and the relationship between current practice and future practice will be the same.

The equation representing this is:
\[ D - 20T = \frac{D - 20}{2} \times 2T \]
\[ D - 20T = T(D - 20) \]
\[ D - 20T = TD - 20T \]
\[ D = TD \]
\[ T = \frac{200}{18 \times 3} \]
\[ T = \frac{200}{54} \]
\[ T = \frac{100}{27} \approx 3.7 \]

So, \( T \) is approximately 3.7 days.

Given \( D \approx 22.22 \) and \( T \approx 3.7 \), we need to find the exact number of days \( T \) when Johnny has 3 times his current practice.

Therefore, Johnny has to practice for approximately 3.7 days to have 3 times as much practice as he currently has. However, in practical terms, we need to round this to the nearest whole number of days.

To have exactly 3 times as much practice as he currently has, Johnny needs to practice for \( \frac{200}{27} \approx 7.4 \) days, rounded to 8 days.

Thus, the number of days needed is 8.

Let's denote the current amount of practice Johnny has as \( P \). According to the problem, 20 days ago, he had half as much practice as he currently has, so 20 days ago he had \( \frac{P}{2} \).

Since Johnny practices the same amount each day, in 20 days, he has practiced \( 20 \times x \) (where \( x \) is the amount of practice he practices each day).

We know that:
\[ P - 20x = \frac{P}{2} \]

Solving this equation for \( x \):
\[ 2P - 40x = P \]
\[ P = 40x \]
\[ x = \frac{P}{40} \]

So, Johnny practices \( \frac{P}{40} \) each day.

Now, to find out when Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he does currently, we need to calculate the number of days \( d \) it will take for him to reach \( 3P \). In \( d \) days, he will have practiced \( dx \). We want:
\[ dx = 3P \]
\[ \frac{P}{40} \cdot d = 3P \]

Solving for \( d \):
\[ d = 3 \times 40 \]

Let's denote the amount of practice Johnny has been doing in the current period as \( x \). According to the problem, 20 days ago, he had half as much practice as he has currently, so he was practicing for \( x/2 \) days 20 days ago.

The total number of days Johnny has been practicing for his current amount of practice can be calculated as follows:

- Let \( d \) be the number of days it takes for Johnny to reach his target amount of practice (3 times what he currently has).
- In that time, he will have practiced \( 3x \).
- The days he has been practicing since 20 days ago are \( d - 20 \).

Since we know he has been practicing for \( x/2 \) days 20 days ago, we can set up the following equation based on the total days he has been practicing:
\[ x + (d - 20) = 3x \]
\[ d - 20 = 2x \]
\[ d = 2x + 20 \]

So, it will take \( 2x + 20 \) days to reach his target amount of practice (3 times what he currently has).

We need to find how many days \( d \) will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he does currently. Therefore, we need to solve for \( d \) in terms of \( x \).

\[ d = 2x + 20 \]
\[ 2x + 20 \text{ is the number of days it will take to reach 3 times his current practice.} \]

Let's substitute \( 2x + 20 \) back into the equation for \( d \):
\[ d = 2x + 20 \]

Finally, we determine the number of days since 20 days ago:
\[ d - 20 = 2x \]

So, it will take \( 2x \) days to reach his target amount of practice (3 times what he currently has).

Now let's use the information given in the problem to find the value of \( x \).
