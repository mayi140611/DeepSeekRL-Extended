system
Let's start by calculating the amount of butter used for each type of cookie.

1. Liza used one-half of the butter for chocolate chip cookies:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

2. She used one-fifth of the butter for peanut butter cookies:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 \text{ kg} = 2 \text{ kg} \]

3. Now, we need to calculate the remaining butter after these two uses. The initial amount of butter is 10 kg. After using 5 kg for chocolate chip cookies and 2 kg for peanut butter cookies, the remaining amount of butter is:
\[ 10 \text{ kg} - 5 \text{ kg} - 2 \text{ kg} = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Next, Liza used one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies. So, the amount of butter used for sugar cookies is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 \text{ kg} = 1 \text{ kg} \]

Finally, we subtract the butter used for sugar cookies from the remaining butter:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} - 1 \text{ kg} = 2 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, after making these three kinds of cookies, Liza has 2 kilograms of butter left.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Liza starts with 10 kilograms of butter.
2. She uses one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies:
   \[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ kilograms} \]
   Amount of butter used for chocolate chip cookies: 5 kilograms.

3. She then uses one-fifth of the remaining butter for peanut butter cookies:
   \[ \frac{1}{5} \times (10 - 5) = \frac{1}{5} \times 5 = 1 \text{ kilogram} \]
   Amount of butter used for peanut butter cookies: 1 kilogram.

4. After using butter for chocolate chip cookies and peanut butter cookies, Liza has:
   \[ 10 - 5 - 1 = 4 \text{ kilograms} \]

5. One-third of the remaining butter is used for sugar cookies:
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 4 = \frac{4}{3} \text{ kilogram} \]

6. To find out how many kilograms of butter are left, we subtract the butter used for sugar cookies from the remaining butter:
   \[ 4 - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{12}{3} - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ kilograms} \]

7. Lastly, we convert \(\frac{8}{3}\) kilograms to a mixed number:
   \[ \frac{8}{3} = 2\frac{2}{3} \text{ kilograms} \]

Therefore, Liza has \(2\frac{2}{3}\) kilograms of butter left after making chocolate chip, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.

Let's first calculate the amount of butter Liza used for each type of cookies:

- Butter for chocolate chip cookies: \(10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5\) kilograms
- Butter for peanut butter cookies: \(10 \times \frac{1}{5} = 2\) kilograms
- Butter for sugar cookies: \(R(tal) \times \frac{1}{3}\)

To find out how much butter was left after making the chocolate chip cookies and the peanut butter cookies, we subtract the butter used for these cookies from the total:

-Butter remaining after chocolate chip cookies: \(10 - 5 = 5\) kilograms
-Butter remaining after peanut butter cookies: \(5 - 2 = 3\) kilograms

Now, we need to calculate the amount of butter used for the sugar cookies:

- Butter for sugar cookies: \(3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1\) kilogram

Finally, to find out how much butter is left after making all three kinds of cookies, we subtract the butter used for sugar cookies from the remaining butter after making the chocolate chip cookies and the peanut butter cookies:

-Butter remaining after sugar cookies: \(3 - 1 = 2\) kilograms

Therefore, Liza has 2 kilograms of butter left after making those three kinds of cookies.

To find out how much butter is left, we'll first calculate how much butter Liza used for each type of cookie and then subtract the total used from the initial amount.

1. Butter for chocolate chip cookies: 
   \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) kg

2. Butter for peanut butter cookies: 
   \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) kg

Now, we'll add the butter used for the first two kinds of cookies:
   \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) kg

Subtract this from the total butter used so far:
   \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) kg

Liza used 3 kg of butter for the sugar cookies. To find out how much butter is left, we subtract this from the butter she initially had:

   \( 10 - 3 = 7 \) kg

So, the number of kilograms of butter left after making those three kinds of cookies is 7 kg.

Liza initially has 10 kilograms of butter. She uses one-half for chocolate chip cookies, which amounts to:
\[ 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \text{ kilograms} \]

One-fifth of the initial amount is used for peanut butter cookies:
\[ 10 \times \frac{1}{5} = 2 \text{ kilograms} \]

The total butter used for chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies is:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ kilograms} \]

Thus, the butter remaining before making sugar cookies is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \text{ kilograms} \]

Liza uses one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies:
\[ 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \text{ kilogram} \]

Therefore, the butter remaining after making the sugar cookies is:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \text{ kilograms} \]

After making chocolates and peanut butter cookies, and then sugar cookies, Liza has:
\[ 2 \text{ kilograms of butter} \]

To find out how much butter is left after making the three kinds of cookies, we need to calculate the amount of butter used for each type and subtract it from the initial amount.

First, Liza bought 10 kilograms of butter.

1. Butter used for chocolate chip cookies: 
   \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 10 kilograms = 5 kilograms.

2. Butter used for peanut butter cookies:
   \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 10 kilograms = 2 kilograms.

Next, we calculate the amount of butter used for the sugar cookies:
   - Total butter used = 5 kilograms (chocolate chip) + 2 kilograms (peanut butter) = 7 kilograms.
   - Remaining butter = 10 kilograms - 7 kilograms = 3 kilograms.

Now, we calculate the butter used for the sugar cookies from the remaining 3 kilograms:
   \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 3 kilograms = 1 kilogram.

Finally, we subtract the butter used for the sugar cookies from the remaining butter:
   3 kilograms (remaining after chocolate and peanut butter cookies) - 1 kilogram (sugar cookies) = 2 kilograms.

So, 2 kilograms of butter are left after making all three kinds of cookies.

To find out how much butter Liza has left after making the cookies, we can follow these steps:

1. She bought 10 kilograms of butter.
2. She used half of it for chocolate chip cookies: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ kg}
   \]
3. She used one-fifth of the remaining butter (which is \(10 - 5 = 5\) kg) for peanut butter cookies:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 5 = 1 \text{ kg}
   \]
   After making the peanut butter cookies, the remaining butter is:
   \[
   5 - 1 = 4 \text{ kg}
   \]
4. She used one-third of the remaining butter (which is \(4\) kg) for sugar cookies:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 4 = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ kg}
   \]
   After making the sugar cookies, the remaining butter is:
   \[
   4 - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{12}{3} - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ kg}
   \]

So, the amount of butter left after making all the cookies is approximately \(2.67\) kg. 

Therefore, the answer is 2.67 kilograms.

First, let's calculate how much butter Liza used for each type of cookie.

For chocolate chip cookies:
\( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \) kg = 5 kg

For peanut butter cookies:
\( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 \) kg = 2 kg

Now, let's calculate the remaining butter after buying chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies.
\( 10 \) kg - (5 kg + 2 kg) = 3 kg

After making chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies, Liza has used up 3 kg of butter. Now, she uses one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies.

Using 1/3 of the remaining 3 kg:
\( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 \) kg = 1 kg

So, out of the 3 kg of butter left, she used 1 kg for sugar cookies.

Finally, let's calculate the amount of butter left after making sugar cookies.
\( 3 \) kg - 1 kg = 2 kg

Therefore, the amount of butter left after making those three kinds of cookies is 2 kilograms.
