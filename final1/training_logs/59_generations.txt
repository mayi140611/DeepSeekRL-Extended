###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Every hour Joanne has to collect the coins out of the fountain inside the mall. During the first hour, she collected 15 coins. For the next two hours, she collected 35 coins from the fountain. In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins from the fountain but she gave 15 of them to her coworker so she could buy a soda. How many coins did she have after the fourth hour?

system
Reasoning:
To determine how many coins Joanne had after the fourth hour, we need to calculate the total number of coins she collected each hour and subtract the ones she gave to her coworker.

1. During the first hour, Joanne collected 15 coins.
2. For the next two hours, she collected 35 coins each hour. So, this part contributes \(35 \times 2 = 70\) coins.
3. In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins but gave 15 of them to her coworker.
4. Therefore, the number of coins Joanne had at the end of the fourth hour is the total collected minus the ones she gave to her coworker.

Calculations:
- Coins collected by Joanne: \(15 + 70 = 85\)
- Coins given to her coworker: 15
- Coins Joanne had after the fourth hour: \(85 - 15 = 70\)

Answer: Joanne had 70 coins after the fourth hour.

```python
# Calculating the total coins collected and subtracting the coins given to her coworker
coins_collected_first_hour = 15
coins_collected_next_two_hours = 35 * 2
coins_collected_fourth_hour = 50
coins_given_to_coworker = 15

# Total coins collected minus coins given to her coworker
total_coins_before_fourth_hour = coins_collected_first_hour + coins_collected_next_two_hours
total_coins_after_fourth_hour = total_coins_before_fourth_hour - coins_given_to_coworker
print(total_coins_after_fourth_hour)
```

<reasoning>
Joanne starts by collecting 15 coins in the first hour. In the next two hours, she collects a total of \(2 \times 35 = 70\) coins. In the fourth hour, she collects 50 coins, but gives away a total of 15 coins. We can sum these values to determine the total number of coins Joanne has after the fourth hour.

First, let's calculate the total coins collected in the first two hours:

\[ \text{Coins from first two hours} = 15 \text{ coins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total coins collected in the fourth hour:

\[ \text{Coins from fourth hour} = 50 \text{ coins} \]
\[ \text{Coins given away} = 15 \text{ coins} \]

Adding these values will give us the total number of coins Joanne has after the fourth hour:

\[ \text{Total coins after fourth hour} = 15 + 70 + (50 - 15) \]

To get the exact value, we need to perform the arithmetic operations.

\[ 15 + 70 + (50 - 15) \]

Let's compute the sum:
\[ 15 + 70 = 85 \]

\[ 85 + 35 = 120 \]

So, Joanne has 120 coins after the fourth hour.

To find out how many coins Joanne had after the fourth hour, we need to account for the coins she collected and gave away.

1. In the first hour, she collected 15 coins.
2. For the next two hours (second and third), she collected 35 coins each hour, totaling 35 + 35 = 70 coins.
3. In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins but gave 15 coins to her coworker, so she kept 50 - 15 = 35 coins from that hour.

Now we add up all the coins she collected and the ones she kept:

15 (first hour) + 70 (next two hours) + 35 (fourth hour) = 120 coins.

Therefore, the answer is 120 coins.

To determine how many coins Joanne has after the fourth hour, we need to break down the collection and the subsequent actions step by step.

1. **First hour**: Joanne collected 15 coins.
2. **Next two hours**: She collected 35 coins each hour.
   \[
   35 \text{ coins/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 70 \text{ coins}
   \]
3. **Fourth hour**: She collected 50 coins but gave 15 coins to her coworker.
   \[
   50 \text{ coins} - 15 \text{ coins} = 35 \text{ coins}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the coins collected over the four hours.

\[
15 \text{ coins (first hour)} + 70 \text{ coins (next two hours)} + 35 \text{ coins (fourth hour)} = 120 \text{ coins}
\]

Therefore, the total number of coins Joanne had after the fourth hour is:

\[
\boxed{120}

To find out how many coins Joanne had after the fourth hour, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

First hour: She collected 15 coins.

Second hour: She collected 35 coins.

Third hour: She collected 35 coins.

Fourth hour: She collected 50 coins.

Total coins after the third hour: \(15 + 35 + 35 = 85\)

After she gave 15 coins to her coworker for buying a soda, she had \(85 - 15 = 70\) coins left.

Therefore, Joanne had 70 coins after the fourth hour.

To determine how many coins Joanne has after the fourth hour, we need to calculate the total number of coins collected and subtract the number of coins given away.

First, let's list the coins collected each hour:
- During the first hour, she collected 15 coins.
- For the next two hours, she collected 35 coins each hour. So, in the next two hours, she collected \(35 + 35 = 70\) coins.
- In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins but gave 15 coins to her coworker. So, the net number of coins collected in the fourth hour is \(50 - 15 = 35\) coins.

Now, we add up all the coins collected:
\[15 + 70 + 35 = 120\]

Therefore, after the fourth hour, Joanne has \(\boxed{120}\) coins.

To determine the total number of coins Joanne had after the fourth hour, we need to consider the coins collected each hour and account for the coins given to her coworker in the fourth hour.

1. In the first hour, Joanne collected 15 coins.
   \[
   \text{Coins after the first hour} = 15
   \]

2. In the second and third hours, Joanne collected 35 coins each hour. Since we don't know how many coins she collected in each of these, letâ€™s assume she collected \(x\) coins in the second hour and \(y\) coins in the third hour.
   \[
   \text{Coins after the second hour} = 15 + 35 + x = 50 + x
   \]
   \[
   \text{Coins after the third hour} = 50 + x + 35 = 85 + x
   \]

3. In the fourth hour, Joanne collected 50 coins but gave 15 of them to her coworker. Therefore, she kept:
   \[
   50 - 15 = 35 \text{ coins}
   \]
   Adding the coins she collected in the fourth hour:
   \[
   \text{Total coins after the fourth hour} = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of coins Joanne had after the fourth hour is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]

To determine the total number of coins Joanne collected after the fourth hour, we'll calculate the amount collected each hour and then adjust for the coins given to her coworker. Here's a breakdown:

- In the first hour, Joanne collected 15 coins.
- For the next two hours, she collected 35 coins each, so that's 35 coins/hour * 2 hours = 70 coins.
- In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins, but then gave 15 coins to her coworker.

Now, let's calculate the total:

- Coins collected in the first hour: 15 coins
- Coins collected in the next two hours: 70 coins
- Coins collected in the fourth hour: 50 coins, but after giving 15 coins to her coworker, she has 50 - 15 = 35 coins

Adding these up:

15 (first hour) + 70 (next two hours) + 35 (fourth hour) = 120 coins

To determine how many coins Joanne has after the fourth hour, we need to calculate the total number of coins she collected during each hour and then account for the coins she gave away.

1. **First hour:**
   Joanne collected 15 coins.

2. **Second and third hours:**
   Joanne collected 35 coins each hour. Therefore, in the second hour, she collected 35 coins, and in the third hour, she also collected 35 coins.

3. **Fourth hour:**
   Joanne collected 50 coins but gave 15 coins to her coworker. 

Now, let's add up all the coins collected and the coins given away:

\[ 15 \text{ (first hour)} + 35 \text{ (second hour)} + 35 \text{ (third hour)} + 50 \text{ (fourth hour)} - 15 \text{ (given to coworker)} \]

Perform the addition and subtraction step-by-step:

\[ 15 + 35 = 50 \]
\[ 50 + 35 = 85 \]
\[ 85 + 50 = 135 \]
