system
Let's denote the weights of Stan, Steve, and Jim as S, W, and J, respectively.

We know that:
1. Jim weighs 110 pounds, so J = 110 pounds.
2. Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim, so W = J - 8 pounds.
3. Stan weighs five pounds more than Steve, so S = W + 5 pounds.

First, we calculate Steve's weight:
\[ W = J - 8 = 110 - 8 = 102 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate Stan's weight:
\[ S = W + 5 = 102 + 5 = 107 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the total weight of Stan, Steve, and Jim:
\[ \text{Total weight} = S + W + J = 107 + 102 + 110 = 319 \text{ pounds} \]

So, their total weight is 319 pounds.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim's weight = 110 pounds
2. Steve weighs 8 pounds less than Jim, so Steve's weight = 110 - 8 = 102 pounds.
3. Stan weighs 5 pounds more than Steve, so Stan's weight = 102 + 5 = 107 pounds.

Now, to find their total weight, we add the weights of Jim, Steve, and Stan together:

Total weight = Jim's weight + Steve's weight + Stan's weight
Total weight = 110 + 102 + 107

Let's calculate the total weight:

110 + 102 = 212
212 + 107 = 319

So, their total weight is 319 pounds.

2. Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim, so Steve weighs 110 - 8 = 102 pounds.
3. Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve, so Stan weighs 102 + 5 = 107 pounds.

Now, we can add their weights:

Jim's weight: 110 pounds
Steve's weight: 102 pounds
Stan's weight: 107 pounds

Total weight = 110 + 102 + 107 = 319 pounds

Therefore, their total weight is 319 pounds.

Let's calculate the weights step by step.

1. Jim weighs 110 pounds.

2. Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim, so:
   Steve's weight = Jim's weight - 8 = 110 - 8 = 102 pounds

3. Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve, so:
   Stan's weight = Steve's weight + 5 = 102 + 5 = 107 pounds

4. To find their total weight, we add the weights of Jim, Steve, and Stan:
   Total weight = Jim's weight + Steve's weight + Stan's weight
                = 110 + 102 + 107
                = 319 pounds

3. Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve. So, Stan's weight = 102 + 5 = 107 pounds.

Now, to find their total weight when they crowd onto the scale, we add their individual weights together:
- Jim's weight: 110 pounds
- Steve's weight: 102 pounds
- Stan's weight: 107 pounds

Total weight = Jim's weight + Steve's weight + Stan's weight
Total weight = 110 + 102 + 107 = 319 pounds

Let's denote Jim's weight as J, Steve's weight as S, and Stan's weight as T.

Given:
- Jim's weight (J) = 110 pounds
- Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim (S = J - 8)
- Stan weighs 5 pounds more than Steve (T = S + 5)

Let's calculate Steve's and Stan's weights first:
S = J - 8 = 110 - 8 = 102 pounds
T = S + 5 = 102 + 5 = 107 pounds

Let's calculate the weight of each person step by step.

1. Jim's weight is given as 110 pounds.
2. Steve weighs 8 pounds less than Jim, so Steve's weight is 110 pounds - 8 pounds = 102 pounds.
3. Stan weighs 5 pounds more than Steve, so Stan's weight is 102 pounds + 5 pounds = 107 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight when all three of them crowd onto the scale at the same time:

Total weight = Jim's weight + Steve's weight + Stan's weight
Total weight = 110 pounds + 102 pounds + 107 pounds
Total weight = 319 pounds

Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know that Jim weighs 110 pounds.
   - Jim's weight = 110 pounds.

2. Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim.
   - Steve's weight = Jim's weight - 8 pounds
   - Steve's weight = 110 pounds - 8 pounds = 102 pounds.

3. Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve.
   - Stan's weight = Steve's weight + 5 pounds
   - Stan's weight = 102 pounds + 5 pounds = 107 pounds.

4. To find their total weight, we add up the weights of Jim, Steve, and Stan.
   - Total weight = Jim's weight + Steve's weight + Stan's weight
   - Total weight = 110 pounds + 102 pounds + 107 pounds = 319 pounds.

Therefore, their total weight is 319 pounds.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of Stan and Steve first, then calculate the total weight of Stan, Steve, and Jim.

1. We know that Jim weighs 110 pounds.
2. Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim, so Steve's weight is 110 - 8 = 102 pounds.
3. Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve, so Stan's weight is 102 + 5 = 107 pounds.

Now we calculate the total weight:
- Jim's weight is 110 pounds.
- Steve's weight is 102 pounds.
- Stan's weight is 107 pounds.

Total weight = Jim's weight + Steve's weight + Stan's weight
              = 110 pounds + 102 pounds + 107 pounds
              = 319 pounds

2. Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim. So, Steve's weight is:
   \( 110 - 8 = 102 \) pounds.

3. Stan weighs 5 pounds more than Steve. So, Stan's weight is:
   \( 102 + 5 = 107 \) pounds.

Now, let's find out their total weight when they crowd onto the scale at the same time:

\( 110 \) (Jim) \( + 102 \) (Steve) \( + 107 \) (Stan) \( = 110 + 102 + 107 \).

Let's denote the weights of Stan, Steve, and Jim as \( S \), \( T \), and \( J \) respectively. From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve:
\[ S = T + 5 \]

2. Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim:
\[ T = J - 8 \]

We are given that Jim's weight \( J \) is 110 pounds:
\[ J = 110 \]

Using the second relationship, we can find Steve's weight \( T \):
\[ T = 110 - 8 = 102 \]

Now we can find Stan's weight \( S \) using the first relationship:
\[ S = T + 5 = 102 + 5 = 107 \]

We need to find the total weight of Stan, Steve, and Jim:
\[ S + T + J = 107 + 102 + 110 = 319 \]
