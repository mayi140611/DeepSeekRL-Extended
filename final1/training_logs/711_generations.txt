To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total cost of making the bracelets, the total revenue from selling them, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Cost Calculation**: 
   - The cost to make one bracelet is the sum of the cost of the string and the beads: $1 (string) + $3 (beads) = $4 per bracelet.

2. **Number of Bracelets Sold**:
   - You sold 25 bracelets.

3. **Total Cost**:
   - The total cost for making 25 bracelets is 25 bracelets × $4 per bracelet = $100.

4. **Total Revenue**:
   - You sold each bracelet for $6, so the total revenue from selling 25 bracelets is 25 bracelets × $6 per bracelet = $150.

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $150 (total revenue) - $100 (total cost) = $50.

Therefore, the total profit you make from selling 25 bracelets is $50.

To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the costs from the revenue.

First, calculate the total costs:
- The cost of string per bracelet is $1, and for 25 bracelets, that's $1 × 25 = $25.
- The cost of beads per bracelet is $3, and for 25 bracelets, that's $3 × 25 = $75.
- The total cost for 25 bracelets is $25 + $75 = $100.

Next, calculate the total revenue:
- Revenue is the selling price per bracelet × number of bracelets sold, which is $6 × 25 = $150.

Now, calculate the profit:
- Profit is the revenue minus the total costs, so it's $150 - $100 = $50.

Therefore, the profit from selling 25 bracelets is $50.

To determine the profit from selling 25 bracelets, we need to first calculate the total cost of producing these bracelets and then subtract this cost from the total revenue generated. 

1. Calculate the total cost:
   - Cost of string per bracelet = $1
   - Cost of beads per bracelet = $3
   - Therefore, total cost per bracelet = $1 + $3 = $4
   - Selling price per bracelet = $6

   Now, we calculate the total cost for 25 bracelets:
   - Total cost = 25 bracelets * $4 per bracelet = $100

2. Calculate the total revenue:
   - Selling price per bracelet = $6
   - Total revenue = 25 bracelets * $6 per bracelet = $150

3. Calculate the profit:
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $150 - $100 = $50

So, if you sell 25 bracelets, you will make a profit of $50.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials for one bracelet. The cost of string for one bracelet is $1 and the cost of beads is $3, so the total cost for one bracelet is $1 + $3 = $4.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 25 bracelets by multiplying the total cost of one bracelet by the number of bracelets sold:
$4 * 25 = $100.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 25 bracelets at $6 each:
$6 * 25 = $150.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$150 - $100 = $50.

To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total costs and then subtract the total revenue from the total costs.

First, calculate the total initial costs for the string and beads:
- Cost for string for 25 bracelets = $1 per bracelet × 25 bracelets = $25
- Cost for beads for 25 bracelets = $3 per bracelet × 25 bracelets = $75
- Total initial costs = $25 (string) + $75 (beads) = $100

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling 25 bracelets:
- Revenue for 25 bracelets = $6 per bracelet × 25 bracelets = $150

To find the profit, subtract the total initial costs from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total costs = $150 - $100 = $50

Therefore, the profit you will make is $50.

First, calculate the total cost of making the bracelets. 
Total cost for string = Number of bracelets x Cost per string
Total cost for string = 25 x $1 = $25
Total cost for beads = Number of bracelets x Cost per beads
Total cost for beads = 25 x $3 = $75

Total cost = Total cost for string + Total cost for beads
Total cost = $25 + $75 = $100

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling the bracelets.
Total revenue = Number of bracelets x Selling price per bracelet
Total revenue = 25 x $6 = $150

Now, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $150 - $100 = $50

It seems there was a mistake in the previous reasoning. Let me correct it.

We need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the profit.

Total cost for string = 25 x $1 = $25
Total cost for beads = 25 x $3 = $75
Total cost = $25 + $75 = $100

Total revenue = 25 x $6 = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $150 - $100 = $50

The correct answer is $50. 
The profit you would make after selling 25 bracelets is $50.

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total cost and the total revenue from selling the charm bracelets.

1. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost of string per bracelet: $1
   - Cost of beads per bracelet: $3
   - Total cost per bracelet: $1 + $3 = $4
   - Since you sell 25 bracelets, the total cost for 25 bracelets is:
     \[
     25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Total Revenue Calculation:**
   - Sale price per bracelet: $6
   - Total revenue from selling 25 bracelets is:
     \[
     25 \times 6 = 150 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   150 - 100 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the profit will be $50.

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total cost and the total revenue. The total cost for the beads, strings, and the beads for the 25 bracelets is $1 + $3 = $4 per bracelet. For 25 bracelets, the total cost is $4 * 25. The total revenue from selling 25 bracelets at $6 each is $6 * 25. The profit is then the total revenue minus the total cost.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = $6 \times 25 - ($1 + $3) \times 25 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = $150 - $100 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = $50 \]

So, the profit from selling 25 bracelets is $50.

To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the total cost of making 25 bracelets.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 25 bracelets.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of making 25 bracelets.
The cost of string for 1 bracelet is $1, so for 25 bracelets, it is \( 25 \times 1 = $25 \).
The cost of beads for 1 bracelet is $3, so for 25 bracelets, it is \( 25 \times 3 = $75 \).
Therefore, the total cost of making 25 bracelets is \( 25 + 75 = $100 \).

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 25 bracelets.
Each bracelet is sold for $6, so the total revenue from 25 bracelets is \( 25 \times 6 = $150 \).

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is \( 150 - 100 = $50 \).

Therefore, you will make a profit of $50.

First, let's calculate the total cost of making one bracelet. The cost of the string is $1 and the cost of the beads is $3. So, the total cost for one bracelet is:

$1 (string cost) + $3 (beads cost) = $4

Next, we calculate the profit per bracelet. You sell each bracelet for $6, but the total cost is $4, so the profit per bracelet is:

$6 (selling price) - $4 (total cost) = $2

Since you sell 25 bracelets, the total profit can be calculated by multiplying the profit per bracelet by the number of bracelets sold:

$2 (profit per bracelet) × 25 (number of bracelets) = $50

Therefore, the total profit is $50.

To calculate the profit, we need to consider the cost of materials, the selling price, and the number of bracelets sold. The total cost for each bracelet includes the cost of the string ($1) and the beads ($3). Therefore, the total cost for each bracelet is $1 + $3 = $4. 

The total cost for 25 bracelets is 25 × $4 = $100.

Each bracelet is sold for $6. If you sell 25 bracelets, the total revenue is 25 × $6 = $150.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the profit is $150 - $100 = $50.
