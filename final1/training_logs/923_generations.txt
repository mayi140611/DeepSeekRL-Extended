###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

<reasoning>
Initially, Ashley invited 20 friends. Each of these friends was supposed to invite one more person, so 20 more people were invited. This makes a total of 20 (initial friends) + 20 (people invited by the friends) = 40 people.

Half of these people came with one more person. So, 40 / 2 = 20 people came with another person.

Therefore, the total number of people at the party, including Ashley, is the initial friends + the people invited by friends + the people who came with another person:

20 (initial friends) + 20 (people invited by friends) + 20 (people who came) = 60 people.

Let's denote the number of friends Ashley invited as \( F = 20 \). According to the problem, Ashley invited each of her friends to invite one more person, so the total number of guests initially would be the sum of Ashley and her friends, plus the additional guests. Since half the number of invited guests each came with one more person, we can calculate the additional number of guests as follows:

- The initial number of friends is 20.
- Therefore, the number of additional friends coming is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Adding these additional guests to the initial number of guests, we get:
\[ 20 (initial) + 10 (additional) = 30 \]

Adding Ashley herself to the count, the total number of people at the party is:
\[ Ashley + 30 = 40 \]

Thus, the total number of people at the party, including Ashley, is 40.

Ashley invited 20 friends, and each one is supposed to bring one more person. So, if half of them come with an extra person, we first need to find out how many of Ashley's friends are bringing an extra person. Since half of 20 is 10, 10 friends will be coming with an extra person each.

The total number of guests brought by the 10 friends will be:
\[ 10 \text{ friends} \times 1 \text{ extra person each} = 10 \text{ extra guests} \]

Now, add these 10 extra guests to the original 20, plus Ashley herself, to get the total number of people at the party. 
\[ 20 \text{ original guests (Ashley included)} + 10 \text{ extra guests} = 30 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people at the party is 30.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited to the party including Ashley: 
20 friends + 1 (Ashley) + 20 more people = 41 people in total

Half the number of invited guests each came with one additional person:
20 friends * (1/2) = 10 people each came with 1 extra person
1 extra person in total

Now, adding this extra person to the initial group of 41 makes a total of:
41 + 10 + 1 = 52 people at the party.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ashley invited 20 friends.
2. Each friend was supposed to invite one more person.
3. Half of the invited friends each came with one more person. So, we first find out how many of the invited guests came extra - half of the 20 invited friends. That would be \(20 / 2 = 10\) extra guests.
4. Ashley herself is a guest at the party.
5. Therefore, the total number of people at the party is the sum of the invited friends (including Ashley) plus the extra guests, which is \(20 + 10 + 1 = 31\).

Now, let's verify the calculation.

Let's denote the number of friends Ashley initially invited as \( F \). According to the problem, \( F = 20 \). The total number of people initially invited to the party is \( F + 20 \) (including Ashley).

Half the number of these initial invitees each came with one more person. So, half the number of initial invitees is \( \frac{F + 20}{2} \). Each of these people brought one more person, so the total additional guests are \( \frac{F + 20}{2} \).

The total number of people at the party is the sum of the initial invitees and the additional guests:
\[ \text{Total} = (F + 20) + \frac{F + 20}{2} \]

Substitute \( F = 20 \):
\[ \text{Total} = (20 + 20) + \frac{20 + 20}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 40 + \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 40 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 60 \]

So, the total number of people at the party is 60.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ashley originally invited 20 friends.
2. She asked each of these friends to bring one more person.
   - Therefore, each of the 20 friends will bring 1 more person, which totals 20 more guests.
3. Now, we need to calculate the total number of people at the party after these additional guests arrive:
   - Ashley: 1 person
   - Original friends brought: 20 guests
   - Additional guests: 20 guests

So, the total number of people at the party is:
$$ 1 \text{ (Ashley)} + 20 \text{ (original friends)} + 20 \text{ (additional guests)} = 41 \text{ people} $$

4. Including Ashley, the total number is 42.

Therefore, the total number of people at the party is 42.

To determine the total number of people at the party, we need to break down the problem into steps:

1. Ashley initially invited 20 friends.
2. Each of these 20 friends is supposed to invite one more person to the party.
3. Therefore, 20 friends * 2 more people per friend = 40 more people.
4. Ashley is also attending the party.
5. Adding Susan's original 20 friends and the additional 40 friends, the total number of people is 20 + 40 + 1 (Ashley).

To calculate the total number of people:
20 (Ashley's friends) + 40 (additional people) + 1 (Ashley) = 61 people.

Therefore, the total number of people at the party is 61.

Let's start by determining how many people were invited in total. Ashley invited 20 friends, and she told each friend to invite one more person, so there were an additional 20 people invited. Therefore, the total number of invited people is 20 (friends) plus 20 (additional guests), which equals 40 people.

Now, let's consider how many of these invited guests came with one more person each. Half of the invited people came with one more person, and half did not. Therefore, half of 40 is 20, and that means 20 extra people came with one more person.

Adding these extra 20 people to the original 40 invited people gives us a total of 60 people at the party.

So, the total number of people at the party, including Ashley, is 60.

Ashley initially invited 20 friends. If half the number of these friends came with one more person, then \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) friends came with one more person. This means that 10 friends brought 10 more guests, for a total of \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) additional people.

Including the 20 initial friends and the 20 additional guests, the total number of people at the party is \( 20 + 20 = 40 \).

However, the question asks for the total number of people at the party, including Ashley. Since Ashley invited the friends, she is also included in the count. Therefore, the total number of people at the party is \( 20 + 20 + 1 = 41 \).

So, the total number of people at the party, including Ashley, is 41.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ashley invited 20 friends initially.
2. Each of these 20 friends is told to invite one more person.
3. Half of the invited guests (20 friends) each came with one more person.
   - Therefore, half of 20 is 10.
4. So, 10 additional people came with each of the 20 friends.
   
To find the total number of attendees, we will include:

- Ashley herself
- The initial 20 friends
- The 10 additional people associated with the 20 friends.

Adding these together:
- Ashley (1 person)
- 20 friends (20 people)
- 10 additional people (from the friends) = 20 + 10 = 30 people

Thus, including Ashley, the total number of people at the party is:
Ashley + 20 friends + 30 additional people = 61 people.

Therefore, the total number of people at the party, including Ashley, is 61.

Half of these additional guests each brought one more person. So, the number of additional people who brought another guest is \(20 / 2 = 10\). Adding these 10 people to the 41 people already there gives the total number of people at the party as \(41 + 10 = 51\).

Ashley initially invited 20 friends. Based on the given information, each of these invited guests is expected to bring one more person to the party.

First, calculate the number of friends who each came with one more person:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 1 = 20 \text{ people} \]

Ashley, as a participant, doesn't count as one of the guests invited by her friends. So, the initial number of guests plus the additional guests equals:
\[ 20 \text{ initial guests} + 20 \text{ additional guests} = 40 \text{ people} \]

This does not include Ashley, who also attended the party. Adding Ashley:
\[ 40 \text{ people} + 1 \text{ Ashley} = 41 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people at the party is 41.

1. Ashley invited 20 friends. According to the problem, she stated that her friends should each invite one more person.
   - Number of friends Ashley invited: 20
   - Each friend should invite: 1 more person

2. If each of Ashley's friends invited one more person, that means:
   - Number of additional people: 20 friends × 1 person = 20 people

3. Now, to find the total number of people at the party, we'll sum up Ashley and her friends:
   - Ashley: 1 person
   - Friends: 20 people
   - Additional guests: 20 people
   
   Total people at the party: 1 + 20 + 20 = 41 people

4. Ashley is also present at the party, so we count her as part of the total number.

Let's denote the number of friends Ashley initially invited as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \). Half of her friends each came with one more person, so half of \( x \) came with guests. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) friends came with guests, and each of these friends invited one more person to the party. Hence, the total number of guests in addition to Ashley would be \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

Now, we add Ashley herself to the total:
1. Ashley herself: 1
2. Friends: \( 20 \)
3. Friends with guests: \( 20 \)

So the total number of people at the party would be \( 1 + 20 + 20 = 41 \).
