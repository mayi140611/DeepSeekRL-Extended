#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Tony went to college for 4 years for science
He then got 2 more degrees in other fields for 4 years each, so that's 4*2=8 years
He also got a graduate degree in physics for 2 more years
Total years of school = The number of years for science + The number of physics years + the number of years for other degrees = 4 + 8 + 2 = 14 years

system
Tony went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science.
He then got 2 more degrees, each taking 4 years, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 years.
He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took 2 years.

The total number of years Tony went to school to be an astronaut is 4 (science degree) + 8 (other degrees) + 2 (graduate degree in physics) = 14 years.

Tony went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science.
He then went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time, which is 4 years each, so 2 * 4 = 8 years.
He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years.

Adding all the years he spent in school:
4 (science degree) + 8 (two more degrees) + 2 (graduate degree) = 14 years.

Therefore, Tony went to school for a total of 14 years to be an astronaut.
