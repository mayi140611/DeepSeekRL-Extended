#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate be $x$. Since Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, Keely and Kendall ate $2x$ nuggets each. This means $x + 2x + 2x = 100$. Combining like terms, we have $5x = 100$. Dividing both sides by 5, we get $x = 20$. 

Therefore, Alyssa ate $\boxed{20}$ chicken nuggets.

Let's denote the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate as A.

According to the problem, Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, so we can represent the number of nuggets they each ate as 2A.

The total number of nuggets they ate together is A (Alyssa) + 2A (Keely) + 2A (Kendall) = 5A.

We know from the problem statement that they ordered 100 chicken nuggets, so we can set up the equation:

5A = 100

To find out how many nuggets Alyssa ate, we need to solve for A:

A = 100 / 5
A = 20

Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.

Let's denote the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate as \( A \). According to the problem, Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many nuggets as Alyssa, so Keely ate \( 2A \) nuggets and Kendall also ate \( 2A \) nuggets.

The total number of nuggets they ate together is \( A + 2A + 2A = 5A \). We know this total is 100 nuggets, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 5A = 100 \]

To find \( A \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ A = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.

Let's denote the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate as \( A \).

Since Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, we can denote the number of nuggets Kendall ate as \( 2A \).

Together, they ordered 100 nuggets, so we can write the equation:

\[ A + 2A + 2A = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5A = 100 \]

Now, we can solve for \( A \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ A = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ A = 20 \]

So, Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.

Let's denote the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate as \( A \).

Since Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, the number of nuggets Kendall ate is \( 2A \), and the number of nuggets Keely ate is also \( 2A \).

Together, they ate 100 nuggets, so we can write the equation:

system
Let \( a \) represent the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate. According to the problem, Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, so Keely ate \( 2a \) nuggets, and Kendall ate \( 2a \) nuggets as well.

The total number of chicken nuggets eaten by Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall is given as 100. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
a + 2a + 2a
\]

Simplify the equation by combining like terms:
\[
a + 2a + 2a = 5a
\]

We know the total number of nuggets is 100, so we set up the equation:
\[
5a = 100
\]

To find the value of \( a \), we solve for \( a \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:
\[
a = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Thus, Alyssa ate \(\boxed{20}\) chicken nuggets.

To find out how many chicken nuggets Alyssa ate, let's set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate,
- \( K \) as the number of chicken nuggets Kendall ate.

According to the problem, Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, so we have:
\[ K = 2A \]
\[ K = 2A \]

The total number of chicken nuggets ordered is 100, so:
\[ A + K + K = 100 \]
\[ A + 2A + 2A = 100 \]
\[ 5A = 100 \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ A = 20 \]

Let's denote the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate as \( A \), the number Keely ate as \( K \), and the number Kendall ate as \( L \). According to the problem, Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall together ordered 100 chicken nuggets:

\[ A + K + L = 100 \]

The problem also states that Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many nuggets as Alyssa, which translates to:

\[ K = 2A \]
\[ L = 2A \]

We can substitute \( K \) and \( L \) with \( 2A \) in the first equation:

\[ A + 2A + 2A = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5A = 100 \]

To find the number of nuggets Alyssa ate (\( A \)), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ A = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ A = 20 \]

Therefore, Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.
