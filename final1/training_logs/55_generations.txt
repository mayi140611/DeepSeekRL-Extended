75
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we first need to determine the total number of flowers and then subtract the number of roses from that total.

Total flowers = 25 roses + 40 tulips + 35 daisies = 100 flowers
Rose flowers = 25

Now we subtract the number of rose flowers from the total to get the number of non-rose flowers: 100 - 25 = 75 flowers

To find the percentage of non-rose flowers, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of non-rose flowers} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of non-rose flowers}}{\text{Total number of flowers}} \right) \times 100
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{Percentage of non-rose flowers} = \left( \frac{75}{100} \right) \times 100 = 75\%
\]

So, 75% of the flowers are not roses.

To determine the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
2. Subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers to find the number of flowers that are not roses.
3. Divide the number of flowers that are not roses by the total number of flowers and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of flowers = 25 roses + 40 tulips + 35 daisies
2. Total number of flowers = 25 + 40 + 35 = 100

So, there are 100 flowers in total in the garden.

3. Number of flowers that are not roses = Total number of flowers - Number of roses
   Number of flowers that are not roses = 100 - 25 = 75

Now, we calculate the percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowers that are not roses} = \left( \frac{75}{100} \right) \times 100\% = 75\%
\]

Therefore, 75% of the flowers in the garden are not roses.

To find the percentage of flowers that are not roses, first, we need to determine the total number of flowers. We do that by adding the number of roses, tulips, and daisies together: \(25 + 40 + 35 = 100\).

Now, to find the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we compare the number of flowers that are not roses (daisies) to the total number of flowers. The formula to calculate percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowers that are not roses}}{\text{Total number of flowers}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{35}{100} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of the flowers in the garden are not roses.

To find the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of tulips + Number of daisies

Total number of flowers = 25 (roses) + 40 (tulips) + 35 (daisies)

Total number of flowers = 100

Now, we need to find the number of flowers that are not roses.

Number of flowers not roses = Total number of flowers - Number of roses

Number of flowers not roses = 100 - 25

Number of flowers not roses = 75

Finally, we calculate the percentage:

Percentage not roses = (Number of flowers not roses / Total number of flowers) × 100

Percentage not roses = (75 / 100) × 100

Percentage not roses = 75%

So, 75% of the flowers in the garden are not roses.

To find the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden and then subtract the number of roses. After that, we can find the percentage of flowers that are not roses.

Total flowers = 25 roses + 40 tulips + 35 daisies = 100 flowers
Flowers that are not roses = Total flowers - Roses = 100 - 25 = 75 flowers

Percentage of flowers that are not roses = (Flowers that are not roses / Total flowers) × 100%

Now, we'll find the number of flowers that are not roses:

<non_roses> = Total number of flowers - Number of roses = 100 - 25 = 75

The percentage of flowers that are not roses is:

<percentage_non_roses> = (75 / 100) × 100 = 75%</percentage_non_roses>

The total number of flowers in the garden is 25 roses + 40 tulips + 35 daisies = 100 flowers.

The number of flowers that are not roses is 100 total flowers - 25 roses = 75 flowers.

To find what percentage of the flowers are not roses, we divide the number of flowers that are not roses by the total number of flowers and multiply by 100. Therefore, ((25 roses / 100 total flowers) * 100 = 25%) are not roses.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of tulips + Number of daisies
Total number of flowers = 25 + 40 + 35 = 100

Now we know there are 100 flowers in total, but the question asks for the percentage of flowers that are not roses. We can do that by subtracting the number of roses from the total to get the number of non-roses flowers, and then dividing by the total to get the percentage.

Number of non-roses flowers = Total number of flowers - Number of roses
Number of non-roses flowers = 100 - 25 = 75

Percentage of flowers that are not roses = (Number of non-roses flowers / Total number of flowers) * 100
Percentage of flowers that are not roses = (75 / 100) * 100 = 75%

Let's calculate the total number of flowers first by adding the number of roses, tulips, and daisies together:

\[
25 \text{ roses} + 40 \text{ tulips} + 35 \text{ daisies} = 100 \text{ flowers}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers are not roses. Since we have 25 roses, we subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers:

\[
100 \text{ flowers} - 25 \text{ roses} = 75 \text{ flowers that are not roses}
\]

Now, to find out what percentage of the flowers are not roses, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowers that are not roses}}{\text{Total number of flowers}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{75}{100} \right) \times 100 = 75\%
\]

Therefore, 75% of the flowers in the garden are not roses.

To calculate the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we first need to find the total number of flowers in the garden. We do this by adding the number of roses, tulips, and daisies.

Total flowers = Roses + Tulips + Daisies
Total flowers = 25 + 40 + 35
Total flowers = 100

Now, we know that there are 25 roses, so the number of flowers that are not roses is the total number of flowers minus the number of roses.

Non-rose flowers = Total flowers - Roses
Non-rose flowers = 100 - 25
Non-rose flowers = 75

To find the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we divide the number of non-rose flowers by the total number of flowers and multiply by 100.

Percentage of non-rose flowers = (Non-rose flowers / Total flowers) * 100
Percentage of non-rose flowers = (75 / 100) * 100
Percentage of non-rose flowers = 75%

To find the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers and then subtract the number of roses from that total to find the number of flowers that are not roses. Finally, we'll find the percentage of these flowers relative to the total number of flowers.

Total number of flowers: 25 (roses) + 40 (tulips) + 35 (daisies) = 100 flowers

Number of flowers that are not roses: 100 (total flowers) - 25 (roses) = 75 flowers

To find the percentage, we use the formula: \( \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowers that are not roses}}{\text{Total number of flowers}} \right) \times 100 \)
