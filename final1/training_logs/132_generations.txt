First, we need to find the total weight of the beef James bought. He bought 5 packs of beef, and each pack weighs 4 pounds. So, the total weight of the beef is 5 * 4 = 20 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. The price of beef is $5.50 per pound. So, if the total weight is 20 pounds, the total cost is 20 * $5.50 = $110.

Therefore, James paid $110 for the beef.

First, we calculate the total weight of the beef James bought by multiplying the number of packs by the weight per pack:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ pounds per pack} = 20 \text{ pounds of beef} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the total weight of the beef by the price per pound:

\[ 20 \text{ pounds of beef} \times \$5.50 \text{ per pound} = \$110 \]

So, James paid \$110 for the beef.

reason
To find out how much James paid for the beef, we first need to calculate the total weight of the beef he bought. He bought 5 packs, and each pack weighs 4 pounds. So, we multiply the number of packs by the weight of each pack:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 5 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ pounds per pack} \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost. We know the price of beef is $5.50 per pound. So, we multiply the total weight by the price per pound:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total weight} \times \$5.50 \text{ per pound} \]

Let's calculate the total weight and then the total cost.
