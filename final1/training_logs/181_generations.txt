system
Initially, the tree is 100 meters tall at the end of 2017. Each year, it grows by 10% of its height from the previous year. 

The height of the tree at the end of 2018 can be calculated as:
\[ 100 \text{ meters} + 10\% \times 100 \text{ meters} = 100 \text{ meters} + 10 \text{ meters} = 110 \text{ meters} \]

The height of the tree at the end of 2019 can be calculated as:
\[ 110 \text{ meters} + 10\% \times 110 \text{ meters} = 110 \text{ meters} + 11 \text{ meters} = 121 \text{ meters} \]

The tree has grown from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019. It has grown for 3 years (from 2017 to 2018, and then from 2018 to 2019).

So, the tree has grown for 3 years.

The tree grows 10% more than its previous height each year, so at the end of 2018, the tree will be:

\[ 100 \times 1.1 = 110 \, \text{meters}\]

and at the end of 2019, the tree will be:

\[ 110 \times 1.1 = 121 \, \text{meters}\]

The tree has grown from 100 meters at the end of 2017 until the end of 2019, which is:

\[ 121 - 100 = 21 \, \text{meters}\]

system
The tree grows 10% more each year, so after one year it will have grown from 100 meters to \(100 \times 1.1 = 110\) meters. The next year, it will grow from 110 meters to \(110 \times 1.1 = 121\) meters. 

The total increase from 2017 until the end of 2019 is the sum of these increases:
\[121 + 110 + 100 = 331\]

Therefore, the tree has grown 331 meters from 2017 until the end of 2019.

The tree grows 10% more each year, so in 2018 it grows 1.1 times its height in 2017, and in 2019 it grows 1.1 times its height in 2018. Therefore, the tree has grown from 2017 until the end of 2019 by the sum of the growth in 2018 and 2019.

In 2018, the tree grows 10% more than its height at the end of 2017, which is \(100 \times 1.1 = 110\) meters. In 2019, the tree grows 10% more than its height at the end of 2018, which is \(110 \times 1.1 = 121\) meters.

Total growth from 2017 until the end of 2019 is the sum of growth in 2018 and 2019:
\[110 + 121 = 231\] meters.

The tree grows by 10% each year, which means in 2018 it will be 100 * 1.1 = 110 meters tall.

In 2017, the tree was 100 meters, and in 2018, it grew to 110 meters.

So, the tree grew from the end of 2017 until the end of 2018 by 110 - 100 = 10 meters.

In 2019, it will be 110 * 1.1 = 121 meters tall.

So the tree grew from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019 by 121 - 110 = 11 meters.

The tree grows by 10% each year, so in 2018, it will grow 10% of its height from 2017, which is 100 meters * 10/100 = 10 meters. So, at the end of 2018, it will be 100 + 10 = 110 meters tall. In 2019, it will grow 10% of its height from 2018, which is 110 meters * 10/100 = 11 meters. So, at the end of 2019, it will be 110 + 11 = 121 meters tall.

The tree grows by 10% of its previous height each year. Starting from 2017, the height of the tree in 2019 can be calculated by summing the growth from each year, considering it grows by 10% each year. 

Let's calculate the growth for 2018 and 2019.

**2018:**
- Initial height: 100 meters.
- Growth: \( 100 \text{ meters} \times 10\% = 10 \text{ meters} \).
- Height at the end of 2018: \( 100 \text{ meters} + 10 \text{ meters} = 110 \text{ meters} \).

**2019:**
- Height at the end of 2018: 110 meters.
- Growth: \( 110 \text{ meters} \times 10\% = 11 \text{ meters} \).
- Height at the end of 2019: \( 110 \text{ meters} + 11 \text{ meters} = 121 \text{ meters} \).

The growth from 2017 to the end of 2019 is the final height minus the initial height of 2017.

\( \text{Final height} - \text{Initial height} = 121 \text{ meters} - 100 \text{ meters} = 21 \text{ meters} \).

Thus, the tree has grown \( 21 \text{ meters} \) from the end of 2017 to the end of 2019.

The tree grows by 10% each year, which means it grows by 100 * 10% = 10 meters each year.

From 2017 to the end of 2018, the tree grows 10 meters, making the height 100 + 10 = 110 meters.

From 2018 to the end of 2019, the tree grows another 10 meters, making the height 110 + 10 = 120 meters.

The tree has grown 10 + 10 = 20 meters from 2017 until the end of 2019.

In 2018, the tree will grow 10% more than its previous height of 100 meters, which is 10 meters. Therefore, the height of the tree at the end of 2018 is 100 meters + 10 meters = 110 meters.

In 2019, the tree will grow 10% more than its previous height of 110 meters, which is 11 meters. Therefore, the height of the tree at the end of 2019 is 110 meters + 11 meters = 121 meters.

The tree's overall growth from the end of 2017 to the end of 2019 is 121 meters - 100 meters = 21 meters.

The tree will grow 10% more than its previous height each year. In 2017, the tree was 100 meters tall. In 2018, it would have grown to:

\(100 + 0.10 \times 100 = 100 + 10 = 110\) meters. 

In 2019, it would have grown to:

\(110 + 0.10 \times 110 = 110 + 11 = 121\) meters. 

So, the tree grew 121 meters from the end of 2017 to the end of 2019.

The tree grows by 10% each year, which means each year it is 1.1 times taller than the previous year.

From 2017 to 2018, the tree will be \(100 \times 1.1 = 110\) meters tall.
From 2018 to 2019, the tree will be \(110 \times 1.1 = 121\) meters tall.

The total growth from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019 is the difference between the height at the end of 2019 and the height at the end of 2017.

The reason is that the tree's growth is compounded each year, so the height at the end of 2019 (after two years) is more than the height at the end of 2017 (after one year).
