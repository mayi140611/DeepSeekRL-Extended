system
Larry spends a half an hour walking and playing with his dog 2 times a day, which is \(0.5 \times 2 = 1\) hour. He also spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog, which is \(0.2\) hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \(1\) hour is \(1 \times 60 = 60\) minutes.

Therefore, Larry spends \(60 + 0.2 = 60.2\) minutes on his dog each day.

#### GENERATION 8 RESPONSE ####

system
Larry spends 30 minutes a day walking and playing with his dog because 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so 1/2 of an hour is 60/2 = 30 minutes. Larry spends 30 minutes a day, twice, so 30 * 2 = 60 minutes per day on dog walking and playing. In addition to dog walking and playing, Larry spends 12 minutes a day feeding his dog because 1/5 of an hour is 60/5 = 12 minutes. So in total, Larry spends 60 + 12 = 72 minutes each day on his dog.

Larry spends 30 minutes (half an hour) twice a day walking and playing with his dog. So, for walking and playing with his dog, he spends:

30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes per day.

He also spends a fifth of an hour (60 minutes) every day feeding his dog. So, for feeding his dog, he spends:

60 minutes * 1/5 = 12 minutes per day.

Therefore, Larry spends:

60 minutes (walking and playing with his dog) + 12 minutes (feeding his dog) = 72 minutes each day.
