###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Gary manages two Amazon distribution centers. The first center processes 10000 packages per day, and the second center processes three times that volume. If Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, how much profit per week do the two centers make combined?

system
The first center processes 10000 packages per day, and the second center processes three times that volume, which is 3 * 10000 = 30000 packages per day.

So the two centers process a combined total of 10000 + 30000 = 40000 packages per day.

Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, so the combined weekly profit is 40000 * 5 cents = 200000 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 200000 cents / 100 = 2000 dollars.

The first center processes 10000 packages per day, so in a week, it processes 10000 * 7 = 70000 packages.
The second center processes three times that volume, so it processes 3 * 10000 = 30000 packages per day.
In a week, the second center processes 30000 * 7 = 210000 packages.
The total number of packages processed per week by both centers is 70000 + 210000 = 280000 packages.
Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, so the total profit per week is 280000 * 0. 05 = 14000.

The first center processes 10000 packages per day, so in a week it processes \(10000 \times 7 = 70000\) packages.
The second center processes three times that volume, which is \(10000 \times 3 = 30000\) packages per day. Thus, in a week it processes \(30000 \times 7 = 210000\) packages.
The total number of packages processed by both centers in a week is \(70000 + 210000 = 280000\).

Since Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, the total profit per week is \(280000 \times 0.05 = 14000\) dollars.

The first center processes 10,000 packages per day, which means it processes \(10,000 \times 7 = 70,000\) packages per week.

The second center processes three times that volume, so it processes \(3 \times 10,000 \times 7 = 210,000\) packages per week.

Together, the two centers process \(70,000 + 210,000 = 280,000\) packages per week.

If Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, then the total weekly profit is \(280,000 \times 0.05 = 14,000\) dollars.

First, let's calculate the daily processing volume for each center:

First center: 10,000 packages/day
Second center: 3 times the first center, which is 3 * 10,000 = 30,000 packages/day

Next, we'll find the combined daily processing volume:

Combined daily processing volume = First center + Second center
                                 = 10,000 packages/day + 30,000 packages/day
                                 = 40,000 packages/day

Now, let's calculate the profit per day:

Profit per day = Combined daily processing volume * Profit per package
               = 40,000 packages/day * $0.05/package
               = $2000/day

Finally, let's find the profit per week:

Profit per week = Profit per day * Number of days in a week
                = $2000/day * 7 days/week
                = $14,000/week

So, the two centers make a combined profit of $14,000 per week.

The first center processes 10000 packages per day and the second center processes three times that volume, so the second center processes \(10000 \times 3 = 30000\) packages per day.

The total number of packages processed per day by the two centers combined is \(10000 + 30000 = 40000\) packages.

If Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, the profit per day is \(40000 \times 0.05 = 2000\) dollars.

To find the weekly profit, we multiply the daily profit by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week), so the weekly profit is \(2000 \times 7 = 14000\) dollars.

The first center processes 10,000 packages per day. The second center processes three times that volume, so it processes 3 * 10,000 = 30,000 packages per day. 

The combined daily processing volume is 10,000 + 30,000 = 40,000 packages per day.

Amazon makes a profit of $0.05 per package, so the profit per day is 40,000 * $0.05 = $2000.

Since we need the weekly profit, we multiply the daily profit by 7 (the number of days in a week). Thus, the weekly profit is $2000 * 7 = $14,000.

First, we need to find out how many packages each center processes per day. The second center processes three times the volume of the first center, which means it processes \(3 \times 10000 = 30000\) packages per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of packages processed by both centers per day. The first center processes 10000 packages and the second center processes 30000 packages, so together they process \(10000 + 30000 = 40000\) packages per day.

To find out how much profit Amazon makes per week, we need to consider the profit per package and the daily profit. Amazon makes 5 cents profit per package, which is equivalent to \$0.05 per package. The daily profit is \(40000 \times 0.05 = 2000\) dollars, and since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly profit is \(2000 \times 7 = 14000\) dollars.

So, the combined profit per week made by the two centers is 14000 dollars.

To find the weekly profit for the two centers combined, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily package processing volume for each center.
2. Determine the total daily profit for both centers.
3. Calculate the weekly profit by multiplying the daily profit by 7.

Let's break it down:

1. First center processes 10,000 packages per day.
2. Second center processes three times that volume, which is \( 10,000 \times 3 = 30,000 \) packages per day.

2. The profit from each center per day:
   - First center: \( 10,000 \times 0.05 = 500 \) dollars per day.
   - Second center: \( 30,000 \times 0.05 = 1500 \) dollars per day.

3. Total daily profit for both centers:
   - Combined: \( 500 + 1500 = 2000 \) dollars per day.

4. Weekly profit (since there are 7 days in a week):
   - Weekly profit: \( 2000 \times 7 = 14000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the two centers make a combined weekly profit of 14,000 dollars.
