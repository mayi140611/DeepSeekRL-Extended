At 7 weeks old, the puppy weighed 6 pounds.
By week 9, it doubled in weight: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pounds.
At 3 months old, it doubled again: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds.
At 5 months old, it doubled once more: \(24 \times 2 = 48\) pounds.
Finally, at one year old, it added another 30 pounds: \(48 + 30 = 78\) pounds.
