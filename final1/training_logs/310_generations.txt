First, let's calculate the total wages for the warehouse workers:

4 workers * $15/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days/month = $12,000

Now, calculate the total wages for the managers:

2 workers * $20/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days/month = $8,000

Total wages for all employees:

$12,000 + $8,000 = $20,000

Next, let's calculate the FICA taxes:

10% * $20,000 = $2,000

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Janet owes:

Total wages + FICA taxes = $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000

First, calculate the monthly salary for each type of employee:

For warehouse workers:
4 workers * $15/hour * 25 days/week * 8 hours/day = $12,000/month

For managers:
2 workers * $20/hour * 25 days/week * 8 hours/day = $12,000/month

Total monthly salary for all workers: $12,000 + $12,000 = $24,000

Next, calculate the FICA taxes Janet needs to pay:

FICA tax rate: 10%
FICA tax amount: $24,000/month * 0.10 = $2,400/month

Now, calculate the total amount Janet owes for wages and taxes:

Total amount: $24,000 (wages) + $2,400 (FICA taxes) = $26,400

4 warehouse workers * $15/hour = $60/hour for warehouse workers
60 * 25 = $1,500 for the week for warehouse workers
1,500 * 8 = $12,000 for the month for warehouse workers

2 managers * $20/hour = $40/hour for managers
40 * 25 = $1,000 for the week for managers
1,000 * 8 = $8,000 for the month for managers

Total wages = $12,000 + $8,000 = $20,000

FICA tax = 10% of $20,000 = $2,000

Total wages and taxes = $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000

First, calculate the daily wage for each type of employee:
- Warehouse worker: \(15 \times 8 = 120\) dollars per day
- Manager: \(20 \times 8 = 160\) dollars per day

Next, calculate the monthly wages for all employees:
- Warehouse workers combined: \(4 \times 25 \times 120 = 12000\) dollars per month
- Managers combined: \(2 \times 25 \times 160 = 800\) dollars per month

Now, calculate the total monthly wages:
- Total monthly wages: \(12000 + 800 = 12800\) dollars

Next, calculate the monthly FICA taxes:
- Total number of employees: 6
- Each employee works 25 days a month
- FICA tax rate: 10%
- Monthly FICA taxes: \(6 \times 25 \times 12000 \times \frac{10}{100} = 180000\) dollars

Finally, add the total monthly wages and the FICA taxes:
- Total wages and taxes: \(12800 + 180000 = 192800\) dollars

First, let's calculate the monthly salary for the four warehouse workers. Each of them makes $15/hour and works 8 hours a day, so their monthly salary is $15/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days/month = $3,000/month. With 4 workers, the total monthly salary for the warehouse workers is $3,000/month/woker * 4 workers = $12,000/month.

Next, let's calculate the monthly salary for the two managers. Each of them makes $20/hour and works 8 hours a day, so their monthly salary is $20/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days/month = $4,000/month. With 2 managers, the total monthly salary for the managers is $4,000/month/manager * 2 managers = $8,000/month.

Now, we add the monthly salaries of the warehouse workers and managers to get the total salary for the workers: $12,000/month + $8,000/month = $20,000/month.

Finally, we need to calculate the FICA taxes Janet has to pay on the workers' salaries. Janet has to pay 10% of the workers' salaries in FICA taxes, so the total amount Janet owes in FICA taxes is 10% * $20,000/month = $2,000/month.

To find the total amount Janet owes for wages and taxes for one month, we add the total monthly salary for the workers and the total monthly FICA taxes: $20,000/month + $2,000/month = $22,000/month.

The four warehouse workers earn 4 workers * $15/hour = $60/hour.
So they earn a total of 4 workers * $60/hour = $240/hour.
The two managers earn 2 workers * $20/hour = $40/hour.
So they earn a total of 2 workers * $40/hour = $80/hour.
So their total earnings are $240/hour + $80/hour = $320/hour.
So they earn a total of $320/hour * 25 days = $8,000/month.
They also owe 10% in FICA taxes, or 10% of $8,000 = $800.
So Janet owes a total of $8,000 + $800 = $8,800.

To calculate the total wages for one month, we need to find the total hours worked by each type of worker, then multiply by their respective hourly rates. 

First, calculate the total hours worked by each group of workers.
- Warehouse workers: 4 workers * 25 days * 8 hours/day = 800 hours
- Managers: 2 workers * 25 days * 8 hours/day = 400 hours

Next, calculate the wages for each group of workers.
- Warehouse workers: 800 hours * $15/hour = $12,000
- Managers: 400 hours * $20/hour = $8,000

Now, add the wages for both groups.
Total wages: $12,000 + $8,000 = $20,000

Finally, calculate the FICA taxes.
- FICA taxes: 10% of total wages = 0.10 * $20,000 = $2,000

Now add the total wages and total FICA taxes to get the total amount Janet owes.
Total amount: $20,000 (wages) + $2,000 (FICA taxes) = $22,000

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings for each type of employee.

The weekly earnings for each worker are the product of their hourly wage and the total number of hours worked in a week.

For warehouse workers:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 25 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

For managers:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 25 \text{ days} = 4000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the monthly total earnings for each type of employee, assuming a 4-week month.

For warehouse workers:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 12000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

For managers:
\[ 4000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 16000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total monthly wages for all employees.

\[ 12000 \text{ dollars/month} + 16000 \text{ dollars/month} = 28000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Finally, let's calculate the total monthly wages including FICA taxes.

First, calculate the FICA tax:

\[ 28000 \text{ dollars} \times 10\% = 2800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, add the FICA tax to the total monthly wages.

\[ 28000 \text{ dollars} + 2800 \text{ dollars} = 30800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Janet owes a total of 30,800 dollars for the wages and taxes for one month.

First, let's calculate the total wage for each type of employee:

For the warehouse workers:
4 workers * $15/hour * 25 days * 8 hours = $12,000 per worker
Total wage for 4 workers = $12,000 * 4 = $48,000

For the managers:
2 workers * $20/hour * 25 days * 8 hours = $8,000 per worker
Total wage for 2 workers = $8,000 * 2 = $16,000

Now, let's add the total wage for both types of employees:

Total wage = $48,000 + $16,000 = $64,000

Next, let's calculate the FICA tax:

FICA tax = $64,000 * 10% = $6,400

First, we calculate the total weekly salary for the warehouse workers:
\[ 4 \text{ workers} \times \$15/\text{hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = \$480/\text{week} \]

Then, we calculate the total weekly salary for the managers:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times \$20/\text{hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = \$320/\text{week} \]

Next, we sum the weekly salaries for both groups of workers:
\[ \$480/\text{week} + \$320/\text{week} = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, we calculate the total monthly salary by multiplying weekly by 4:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200/\text{month} \]

To find out how much Janet owes in FICA taxes, we calculate 10% of the monthly salary:
\[ 0.10 \times \$3200 = \$320 \]

Finally, we add the FICA taxes to the total monthly salary to get the total amount Janet owes for wages and taxes:
\[ \$3200 + \$320 = \$3520 \]

To calculate Janet's total expenses for wages and taxes for one month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly salary for each type of employee.
2. Sum the total wages for all employees.
3. Calculate the FICA tax on the total wages.
4. Sum the total wages and the FICA tax to get the total expense.

**Step 1: Calculate the monthly salary for each type of employee.**

- **Warehouse workers:**
  - Each worker works 25 days a month x 8 hours a day = 200 hours per month
  - Each worker is paid $15/hour
  - Monthly salary for each warehouse worker = 200 hours x $15/hour = $3000

  - Since there are four warehouse workers, the total wage for the warehouse workers = 4 workers x $3000 = $12000

- **Managers:**
  - Each manager works 25 days a month x 8 hours a day = 200 hours per month
  - Each manager is paid $20/hour
  - Monthly salary for each manager = 200 hours x $20/hour = $4000

  - Since there are two managers, the total wage for the managers = 2 managers x $4000 = $8000

**Step 2: Sum the total wages for all employees.**

Total wages = Wages for warehouse workers + Wages for managers
Total wages = $12000 + $8000 = $20000

**Step 3: Calculate the FICA tax on the total wages.**

FICA tax rate = 10%
FICA tax on total wages = 10% of $20000 = 0.10 x $20000 = $2000

**Step 4: Sum the total wages and the FICA tax to get the total expense.**

Total expense = Total wages + FICA tax
Total expense = $20000 + $2000 = $22000

Therefore, Janet owes a total of $22000 for the wages and taxes for one month.
