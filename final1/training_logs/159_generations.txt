Mario's haircuts are 50% more expensive during the weekends, so if a haircut costs $18 on weekdays, it would cost $18 + 0.5 * $18 = $18 + $9 = $27 on the weekend.
So he would have paid $27/day before.

During the weekends, haircuts at Mario's barbershop cost 50% more than the regular price. Therefore, the regular price is $18 / 1.5 = $12.

To find out how much Mario would have paid the day before, we subtract the difference between the weekend price and the regular price from the weekend price. So, the price on Saturday would have been $18 - $6 = $12.

Let's calculate this step by step.

1. First, let's determine the cost of Mario's last haircut on Monday. According to the information, the cost is $18.
2. The haircut on Wednesday (the day before Monday) would be 50% more expensive than the $18.
3. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of $18 and add it to the original amount.
4. 50% of $18 is 0.50 × $18 = $9.
5. Now, we add this to the original amount: $18 + $9 = $27.

Therefore, Mario would have spent $27 on his haircut on Wednesday.

On the weekend (Saturday), haircuts are 50% more expensive than on weekdays, which means they cost $18 + (50% of $18) = $18 + $9 = $27.
To get the answer to the question, we subtract the price Mario paid for his last haircut on Sunday from the price he would have paid for the same haircut on the previous weekend, which is $27 – $18 = $9.

#### GENERATION 16 RESPONSE ####

system
The price of haircuts is 50% more during the weekends than on weekdays. On Monday, Mario pays $18 for a haircut, which is 50% more than the price on weekdays. Therefore, the weekday price for a haircut would be $18 / (1 + 0.5) = $12. 

The price of $18 is more than the weekday price of $12, meaning that the haircut was on a weekend day. Subtracting the weekday price from the weekend price, we find that the price on Sunday (the day before Monday) would have been $18 - $12 = $6.
