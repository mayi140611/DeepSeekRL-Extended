To calculate the cost of running Kim's TV for a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily energy consumption:**
   - Watts consumed per hour: 125
   - Hours of use per day: 4
   - Daily energy consumption: \( 125 \text{ watts} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 500 \text{ watt-hours} \)

2. **Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:**
   - 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt-hours
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours: \( \frac{500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 0.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours} \)

3. **Calculate the weekly energy consumption:**
   - Days in a week: 7
   - Weekly energy consumption: \( 0.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 3.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours} \)

   - Cost per kilowatt-hour: 14 cents
   - Weekly cost: \( 3.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours} \times 14 \text{ cents/kilowatt-hour} = 49 \text{ cents} \)

5. **Calculate the total weekly cost (including all days):**
   - We need to consider the weekly cost for two possible scenarios:
     a) Running 4 hours per day: \( 4 \text{ days} \times 49 \text{ cents/day} = 196 \text{ cents} \)
     b) Running 5 hours per day: \( 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ hours} \)
           \( 20 \text{ hours} \times 0.5 \text{ kW/h} \times 14 \text{ cents/kW/h} = 140 \text{ cents} \)
     c) Running 6 hours per day: \( 4 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ hours/day} = 24 \text{ hours} \)
           \( 24 \text{ hours} \times 0.5 \text{ kW/h} \times 14 \text{ cents/kW/h} = 168 \text{ cents} \)

6. **Calculate the average weekly cost:**
   - Sum of all weekly costs: \( 196 + 140 + 168 = 404 \text{ cents} \)
   - Average weekly cost: \( \frac{404 \text{ cents}}{3} = 134.67 \text{ cents} \)

Therefore, the average weekly cost to run Kim's TV for a week is approximately **134.67 cents**.

To determine the cost of running Kim's TV for a week, we first need to calculate the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

First, we find the total energy consumption in kWh per day. The TV uses 125 watts per hour and runs for 4 hours each day. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the power consumption to kW:

125 watts = 0.125 kW

The energy consumption per hour is then:
0.125 kW/hour × 4 hours/day = 0.5 kWh/day

Next, we calculate the energy consumption for a week:
0.5 kWh/day × 7 days/week = 3.5 kWh/week

Now, we know the cost of electricity is 14 cents per kWh. Therefore, the weekly cost to run the TV is:
3.5 kWh/week × 14 cents/kWh = 49 cents/week

So, Kim's TV costs 49 cents to run for a week.

1. **Calculate the daily electricity consumption in watt-hours:**
   - The TV uses 125 watts per hour.
   - Kim runs the TV for 4 hours a day.
   \[
   \text{Daily electricity consumption} = 125 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} = 500 \, \text{watt-hours/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly electricity consumption in watt-hours:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   \text{Weekly electricity consumption} = 500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 3500 \, \text{watt-hours/week}
   \]

3. **Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:**
   - There are 1000 watt-hours in 1 kilowatt-hour.
   \[
   \text{Weekly electricity consumption} = \frac{3500 \, \text{watt-hours/week}}{1000} = 3.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/week}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of electricity consumption:**
   - The cost of electricity is 14 cents per kilowatt-hour.
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost} = 3.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/week} \times 14 \, \text{cents/kilowatt-hour} = 49 \, \text{cents/week}
   \]

5. **Convert daily cost to weekly cost:**
   - Since running the TV for 4 hours a day means it's running for half of a week, we need to recognize that running it for 4 hours per day is equivalent to running it for half a week. Therefore, the cost for 4 hours per day would be the same as the cost for half a week.
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost} = 49 \, \text{cents/week}
   \]

Thus, the cost of running Kim's TV for a week is \boxed{49} cents.

To find the cost to run the TV for a week, we first need to calculate the total electricity consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

The TV uses 125 watts per hour. There are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, so the TV uses 125/1000 = 0.125 kW per hour.
Running for 4 hours a day, the total consumption is 0.125 kW/h * 4 h = 0.5 kW*h per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption for a week is 0.5 kW*h/day * 7 days = 3.5 kW*h.

Electricity costs 14 cents per kWh, so for a week, the cost is 3.5 kWh * $0.14/kWh = $0.50.
