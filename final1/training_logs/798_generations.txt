###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Ivan has a bird feeder in his yard that holds two cups of birdseed. Every week, he has to refill the emptied feeder. Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan’s bird feeder feed weekly?

system
<reasoning>
To determine how many birds Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly, we need to first calculate the amount of birdseed available in the feeder each week after accounting for the squirrel's theft.

The feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed. The squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed every week. Therefore, the remaining amount of birdseed in the feeder is:
\[ 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 \text{ cups} \]

Since each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds, 1.5 cups of birdseed will feed:
\[ 1.5 \times 14 = 21 \text{ birds} \]

Thus, Ivan's bird feeder feeds 21 birds weekly.

First, we need to determine how much birdseed is left in the feeder after one week. Since the squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed, the amount of birdseed left is \(2 - 0.5 = 1.5\) cups. Now, we need to calculate how many birds can be fed with 1.5 cups of birdseed if each cup can feed 14 birds. The number of birds fed with 1.5 cups of birdseed is \(1.5 \times 14 = 21\).

First, let's determine the amount of birdseed actually available for the birds weekly after the squirrel steals half a cup. Since the feeder holds two cups, the squirrel steals half a cup, so there are 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 cups of birdseed left for the birds.

Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, so 1.5 cups can feed \( 1.5 \times 14 = 21 \) birds.

Therefore, Ivan’s bird feeder feeds 21 birds weekly.

To determine how many birds Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly, we need to account for the birdseed in the feeder and subtract the amount stolen by the squirrel. Initially, the feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed. Each cup feeds 14 birds, so 2 cups would normally feed \(2 \times 14 = 28\) birds. However, the squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed every week, which means \(0.5\) cups are lost. Thus, the actual amount of birdseed available is \(2 - 0.5 = 1.5\) cups.

With 1.5 cups of birdseed, each cup can feed 14 birds, so \(1.5\) cups can feed \(1.5 \times 14 = 21\) birds.

Therefore, Ivan's bird feeder feeds 21 birds weekly.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much birdseed is available for feeding each week and then calculate the number of birds that can be fed. Here are the steps:

1. **Total birdseed capacity**: Ivan's feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed.

2. **Squirrel's theft**: The squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed every week.

3. **Remaining birdseed**: Subtract the squirrel's theft from the total birdseed capacity:
   \[
   2 \text{ cups} - 0.5 \text{ cups} = 1.5 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Birds fed per cup**: Each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds.

5. **Total birds fed**: Multiply the remaining birdseed by the number of birds each cup can feed:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ cups} \times 14 \text{ birds per cup} = 21 \text{ birds}
   \]

So, Ivan’s bird feeder can feed 21 birds weekly.

To determine how many birds Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly, we need to consider the following:
1. The bird feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed.
2. Each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds.
3. The squirrel steals 0.5 cups of birdseed each week, so the amount of birdseed available for the birds is \(2 - 0.5 = 1.5\) cups.

Now, if each cup of birdseed feeds 14 birds, then 1.5 cups of birdseed will feed \(1.5 \times 14\) birds. Let's calculate this:

To determine how many birds Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly, we need to account for the birdseed consumption from several sources: the refill, the squirrel stealing, and the actual birdseed available.

1. The bird feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed, and each cup can feed 14 birds. Therefore, with 2 cups, the bird feeder can feed \(2 \times 14 = 28\) birds initially.
2. The squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed each week. This means Ivan loses 7 birds (\(0.5 \text{ cup} \times 14 \text{ birds per cup}\)) to the squirrel.
3. After accounting for the squirrel stealing, the bird feeder effectively has \(2 - 0.5 = 1.5\) cups of birdseed. With 1.5 cups, the bird feeder can feed \(1.5 \times 14 = 21\) birds.
4. Adding the initial 28 birds fed by the refill, the total number of birds fed by the feeder each week is \(28 + 21 = 49\).

Therefore, Ivan’s bird feeder feeds 49 birds weekly.

First, we need to determine the amount of birdseed available in the feeder at the beginning of each week. The feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed, and the squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed every week, leaving 1.5 cups of birdseed available.

Next, we calculate how many birds can be fed with the available birdseed. Each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds. Therefore, with 1.5 cups of birdseed, the number of birds that can be fed is \( 1.5 \times 14 \).

Finally, we perform the multiplication to find the total number of birds fed in a week:
\[ 1.5 \times 14 = 21 \]

So, Ivan’s bird feeder feeds 21 birds every week.

To determine how many birds Ivan’s bird feeder feeds weekly, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net amount of birdseed the feeder can hold each week.
2. Use the net amount of birdseed to find out how many birds it can feed.

First, Ivan's bird feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed, but the squirrel steals half a cup every week. So, the net amount of birdseed that remains each week is:
\[ 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 \text{ cups} \]

Each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds. Therefore, the total number of birds that can be fed with 1.5 cups of birdseed is:
\[ 1.5 \times 14 = 21 \text{ birds} \]

Now, we know that the squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed every week. Since this amount is less than a full cup, it will still be able to feed birds.

So, Ivan’s bird feeder feeds 21 birds weekly.

First, we need to determine the total amount of birdseed that Ivan has available each week. Since the bird feeder holds two cups of birdseed, and each cup can feed fourteen birds, we start by calculating the total birdseed capacity:

\[ 2 \text{ cups} \times 14 \text{ birds/cup} = 28 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we address the squirrel’s theft. The squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed every week. Since each cup feeds fourteen birds, half a cup can feed:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup} \times 14 \text{ birds/cup} = 7 \text{ birds} \]

This means that the squirrel steals 7 birds each week. To find out how many birds actually eat the birdseed on Ivan’s bird feeder, we subtract the 7 birds stolen by the squirrel from the total capacity:

\[ 28 \text{ birds} - 7 \text{ birds} = 21 \text{ birds} \]

Therefore, Ivan’s bird feeder feeds 21 birds weekly.

To determine how many birds Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly, we need to account for both the birdseed available and the amount stolen by the squirrel.

1. The bird feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed.
2. Each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds, so 2 cups can feed \(2 \times 14 = 28\) birds.
3. The squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed each week, which can feed \(\frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7\) birds.
4. Therefore, the net amount of birdseed available each week is the difference between the birdseed available and the birdseed stolen: \(2 - \frac{1}{2} = 1.5\) cups. This means 1.5 cups can feed \(1.5 \times 14 = 21\) birds.

So, Ivan's bird feeder feeds 21 birds weekly.

To determine how many birds Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Capacity of the feeder**: The feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed.
2. **Birds fed per cup**: Each cup can feed 14 birds.
   - Therefore, with 2 cups, the total number of birds fed would be \(2 \times 14 = 28\) birds per week.
3. **Amount stolen by the squirrel**: The squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed each week.
4. **Birds fed by birds taken away**: Since the squirrel steals half a cup, it would feed \(0.5 \times 14 = 7\) birds.

Now, we subtract the birds fed by the squirrels from the total birds fed by the feeder:
- Total birds fed by the feeder: 28
- Birds fed by the squirrels: 7
- Net birds fed by Ivan’s bird feeder: \(28 - 7 = 21\)

Therefore, the bird feeder feeds Ivan approximately 21 birds per week.
