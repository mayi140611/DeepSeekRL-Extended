To determine the minimum number of rides needed to make the 30-day pass strictly cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket, we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the total cost of taking \( n \) rides with the 30-day pass is greater than the total cost of taking \( n \) one-way tickets.

The cost of a one-way ticket is $2 per ticket. Therefore, the cost of \( n \) one-way tickets is \( 2n \) dollars.

The cost of a 30-day pass is $50. Since a 30-day pass covers 30 rides, the cost of \( n \) rides with a 30-day pass is \( 50 \div 30 \times n \) (since each ride using the 30-day pass costs the same as a one-way ticket, $50 divided by 30).

We need \( 50 \div 30 \times n \) to be greater than \( 2n + 2 \) (the cost of \( n \) one-way tickets).

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 50 \div 30 \times n > 2n + 2 \]
\[ \frac{50}{30} \times n > 2n + 2 \]
\[ \frac{5}{3}n > 2n + 2 \]
\[ \frac{5}{3}n - 2n > 2 \]
\[ \frac{5n - 6n}{3} > 2 \]
\[ \frac{-n}{3} > 2 \]
\[ -n > 6 \]
\[ n < -6 \]

Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, and the inequality we derived \( n < -6 \) is not valid for positive \( n \), we need to re-evaluate our approach. We should ensure the inequality is correctly interpreted in terms of positive \( n \):

\[ 50 \div 30 \times n > 2n + 2 \]
\[ \frac{5n}{30} > 2n + 2 \]
\[ \frac{n}{6} > 2n + 2 \]
\[ \frac{n - 12n}{6} > 2 \]
\[ \frac{-11n}{6} > 2 \]
\[ -11n > 12 \]
\[ n < -\frac{12}{11} \approx -1.09 \]

Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality is \( n = 2 \).

Therefore, the minimum number of rides you need to take every month so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket is \( n = 2 \).

To determine the minimum number of rides required so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride, we need to compare the cost per ride for both options.

1. First, calculate the cost per ride for the one-way ticket:
\[ \text{Cost per ride for one-way ticket} = \frac{2 \text{ dollars}}{1 \text{ ride}} = 2 \text{ dollars/ride} \]

2. Next, calculate the cost per ride for the 30-day pass:
\[ \text{Cost per ride for 30-day pass} = \frac{50 \text{ dollars}}{N \text{ rides}} \]
where \( N \) is the number of rides.

3. We need to find the minimum \( N \) such that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride:
\[ 2 < \frac{50}{N} \]

4. Solving for \( N \):
\[ N < \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ N < 25 \]

5. Since \( N \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( N \) is 25.

Therefore, the minimum number of rides needed so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride is 25.

To determine the minimum number of rides needed so that the 30-day pass becomes strictly cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket, we need to calculate the cost per ride for each option.

- If you take one one-way ticket per month, the cost per ride is $2.
- For the 30-day pass, if you use it for 30 days, the cost is $50, but we need to consider the cost per day. If you ride 30 times a month, the cost per ride is $50 divided by 30 days, which equals $1.67 per ride.

We need to find the point where the 30-day pass becomes cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket. This means the cost per ride on the 30-day pass must be lower than the cost per ride on a one-way ticket. Since a one-way ticket costs $2 and the 30-day pass costs $50, and assuming each ride costs $0.67 or less (which is lower than the cost per ride on the 30-day pass), the 30-day pass will become cheaper per ride at the minimum when the cost per ride is less than or equal to the cost of a one-way ticket.

To find the minimum number of rides, we set the cost per ride on the 30-day pass equal to the cost per ride on a one-way ticket and solve for the number of rides:

\[ \frac{50}{30} = \text{cost per ride on the 30-day pass} \]

\[ \frac{50}{30} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \]

So, the 30-day pass is approximately $1.67 per ride. Since a one-way ticket costs $2, which is more than $1.67, the 30-day pass will be cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket only when you take enough rides to make the cost per ride on the 30-day pass equal to $2.

Let \( x \) be the number of rides needed.

\[ \frac{50}{x} = 2 \]

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]

\[ x = 25 \]

So, you will need to take at least 25 rides each month, and you will find that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket.

To determine the minimum number of rides needed to make the 30-day pass strictly cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket, we can set up a comparison between the cost per ride of the one-way ticket and the 30-day pass.

A one-way ticket costs $2. 
A 30-day pass costs $50.

To compare them, we take the 30-day pass cost and divide it by the number of rides, which we will call \( n \). The cost per ride for the 30-day pass is:
\[
\frac{50}{n} \text{ dollars}
\]

We need this cost to be less than the cost of a one-way ticket per ride, which is $2:
\[
\frac{50}{n} < 2
\]

To find \( n \), we solve the inequality:
\[
50 < 2n
\]
\[
n > \frac{50}{2}
\]
\[
n > 25
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the smallest possible value of \( n \) that satisfies the condition is \( n = 26 \).

Thus, you need to take at least 26 rides every month to find that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride.

If the one-way ticket costs $2 and the 30-day pass costs $50, we need to find the minimum number of rides $n$ such that the cost per ride with the 30-day pass is less than the cost per ride with the one-way ticket.

Using the cost per ride, we can write the following inequality:

\[2n > 50 \]
\[n > 25 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a ride, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the minimum number of rides needed is 26.

To find the minimum number of rides needed for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride, we need to calculate the cost per ride for the 30-day pass and compare it to the cost per ride for a one-way ticket.

If you take the 30-day pass, you pay $50 for a 30-day period. With one day out of 30 being a one-way ticket, the number of one-way tickets you use in a month is 30 - 1 = 29. So, the total cost with the 30-day pass is $29 (for the one-way tickets) + $50 (for the 30-day pass) = $79. The cost per ride with the 30-day pass is $79 / 30 = $2.63.

With a one-way ticket, you pay $2 per ride. So, we need to find the minimum number of rides \( x \) such that the cost per ride with a one-way ticket is strictly less than the cost per ride with the 30-day pass.

The cost per ride with a one-way ticket is $2. The cost per ride with the 30-day pass is $2.63.

For the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride, we need \( 2 < 2.63 \).

This is already true, so you would need to take more than 29 rides to make the 30-day pass strictly cheaper per ride. So, the minimum number of rides is \( 30 \).

Therefore, you will need to take at least 30 rides every month to make the 30-day pass strictly cheaper per ride.

To determine the minimum number of rides required for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride, we need to analyze the cost per ride for both the one-way tickets and the 30-day pass.

First, let's calculate the number of rides per month for the 30-day pass:
\[ 30 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ ride/day} = 30 \text{ rides/month} \]

The cost per ride for the 30-day pass is:
\[ \frac{\$50}{30 \text{ rides}} = \$1.67 \text{ per ride} \]

Next, let's consider the cost per ride for one-way tickets. A one-way ticket costs $2 per ride, but we need to determine how many rides we can take with $2 within a month. Assume we take the 30-rides-per-month amount:

The cost per ride for one-way tickets is:
\[ \frac{\$2}{30 \text{ rides/month}} = \$0.07 \text{ per ride} \]

Since $1.67 is greater than $0.07, the 30-day pass is cheaper per ride when you ride 30 times a month.

To confirm that 29 rides per month is not enough for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride, we calculate the cost per ride if you take 29 rides a month:
\[ \frac{\$50}{29 \text{ rides}} = \$1.72 \text{ per ride} \]
Since $1.72 is greater than $1.67, the cost per ride is the same when you take 29 rides per month.

Therefore, the minimum number of rides per month needed for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride is 30.

To determine the minimum number of rides needed for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride, we need to calculate the cost per ride for each option.

First, calculate the cost per ride for the one-way ticket:
\[ \text{Cost per ride for one-way ticket} = \frac{2}{1} = 2 \text{ dollars per ride} \]

Next, calculate the cost per ride for the 30-day pass:
\[ \text{Cost per ride for 30-day pass} = \frac{50}{30} \approx 1.67 \text{ dollars per ride} \]

We need the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride than the one-way ticket. This means the cost per ride for the 30-day pass should be greater than 2 dollars:
\[ \frac{50}{30} > 2 \]

To find the minimum number of rides \( n \), we set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{50}{30} > 2 \]
\[ 1.67 > 2 \]

Since 1.67 is not strictly greater than 2, we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the cost per ride for the 30-day pass is exactly or slightly less than 2 dollars. We can test smaller values of \( n \) to find the minimum critical number:

For 1 ride:
\[ \frac{50}{30} > 1.67 \]

For 2 rides:
\[ \frac{50}{30} > 3.34 \]

For 3 rides:
\[ \frac{50}{30} > 5 \]

It is clear that for 2 rides, the 30-day pass is not cheaper than the one-way ticket. For 3 rides, the 30-day pass is more expensive per ride. Therefore, the minimum number of rides needed for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride is 3.

To determine the minimum number of rides needed so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride, let's calculate the cost per ride for both options.

A 30-day pass costs $50, and it allows unlimited rides for 30 days. So, the cost per ride with a 30-day pass is $50 / number of rides = $50/n.

A one-way ticket costs $2 and is used for a single ride, so the cost per ride with a one-way ticket is $2.

To find the number of rides where the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket, we need to find the point where the cost per ride with the 30-day pass is less than $2.

So, we set up the inequality:
$50/n < $2

Solving for n:
n > 50 / 2
n > 25

Since the number of rides must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, because you can't take a fraction of a ride. So, you need at least 26 rides per month for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride compared to taking one-way tickets.

Therefore, the answer is 26.

To determine the minimum number of rides needed to make the 30-day pass strictly cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket, we start by calculating the cost per ride for each option.

A one-way ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride for a one-way ticket is:

\[ \frac{2}{1} = 2 \text{ dollars per ride} \]

A 30-day pass costs $50, which provides access to 30 rides. Therefore, the cost per ride for the 30-day pass is:

\[ \frac{50}{30} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \text{ dollars per ride} \]

We need to find the minimum number of rides, \( n \), such that the 30-day pass per ride is strictly cheaper. This means we need to solve the inequality:

\[ \frac{50}{n} < 2 \]

To isolate \( n \), we multiply both sides of the inequality by \( n \):

\[ 50 < 2n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ 25 < n \]

This tells us that \( n \) must be greater than 25. The smallest integer greater than 25 is 26. To verify, we substitute \( n = 26 \) into the cost per ride formula:

\[ \frac{50}{26} \approx 1.92 \text{ dollars per ride} \]

Since 1.92 dollars per ride is less than 2 dollars per ride, the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride when you take 26 rides or more.

Therefore, the minimum number of rides you will need to take every month to make the 30-day pass strictly cheaper per ride is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]

To determine the minimum number of rides needed so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride, we need to set up an equation comparing the cost per ride for the one-way ticket and the 30-day pass.

1. The cost of a one-way ticket is $2 per ride.
2. The cost of a 30-day pass is $50.

We want to find the minimum number of rides \( n \) such that the cost per ride for the 30-day pass is less than the cost per ride for the one-way ticket.

The cost per ride for the 30-day pass is given by:
\[
\text{Cost per ride for 30-day pass} = \frac{50}{n}
\]

We want this to be less than the cost per ride for the one-way ticket:
\[
\frac{50}{n} < 2
\]

To solve for \( n \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by \( n \):
\[
50 < 2n
\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[
25 < n
\]

This inequality tells us that \( n \) must be greater than 25. Since \( n \) represents the number of rides and must be a whole number, the smallest possible value for \( n \) is 26.

Therefore, the minimum number of rides you need to take every month so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride is 26.

To determine the minimum number of rides needed for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride, we need to compare the cost per ride for both options.

Given:
- Cost of a one-way ticket: $2
- Cost of a 30-day pass: $50 for 30 rides

The cost per ride for a one-way ticket is $2, and for the 30-day pass, it is $50 ÷ 30 = $1.67 per ride.

To find the minimum number of rides where the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride, we start by comparing the cost per ride of the one-way ticket and the 30-day pass.

- For each ride, we need to see if the cost of the one-way ticket ($2) is less than or equal to the cost per ride of the 30-day pass ($1.67).

Let \( n \) be the number of rides. The cost per ride for the one-way ticket is $2, and for the 30-day pass, it is $1.67 per ride. We need \( 2 \leq 1.67 \cdot n \).

To find the minimum number of rides \( n \) where the one-way ticket is less expensive than the 30-day pass per ride, we solve the inequality:

\[ 2 \leq 1.67 \cdot n \]

Divide both sides by 1.67:

\[ \frac{2}{1.67} \leq n \]

\[ n \geq 1.186 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we take the ceiling value, which is 2.

So, the minimum number of rides needed so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride is 2 rides.

To determine the minimum number of rides needed so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket, we need to compare the cost per ride for each option.

A one-way ticket costs $2. Since there are 30 days in a month, the cost per ride for a one-way ticket is:
\[ \frac{2}{30} = \frac{1}{15} \text{ dollars per ride} \]

A 30-day pass costs $50, so the cost per ride for the 30-day pass is:
\[ \frac{50}{30} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ dollars per ride} \]

We need to find the minimum number of rides \( n \) such that the one-way ticket's cost per ride is less than the 30-day pass's cost per ride. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{1}{15} < \frac{5}{3} \]

To solve this inequality, we can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
\[ 1 \cdot 3 < 15 \cdot 5 \]
\[ 3 < 75 \]

Since this inequality is true for any positive integer \( n \), the minimum number of rides needed is 30. This is because the cost per ride for 30 rides (with the 30-day pass) is:
\[ \frac{50}{30} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ dollars per ride} \]
which is indeed less than the cost per ride for 30 rides with the one-way ticket, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{30} = \frac{1}{15} \text{ dollars per ride} \]

Therefore, the minimum number of rides you need to take every month so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride is:

To determine the minimum number of rides needed so that the 30-day pass becomes strictly cheaper per ride, we need to compare the cost per ride of the one-way ticket to the cost per ride of the 30-day pass.

1. **Cost per ride of the one-way ticket**:
   \[
   \text{Cost per ride of one-way ticket} = \frac{\text{Price of one-way ticket}}{\text{Number of rides}} = \frac{2}{n}
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number of rides per month.

2. **Cost per ride of the 30-day pass**:
   \[
   \text{Cost per ride of 30-day pass} = \frac{\text{Price of 30-day pass}}{\text{Number of rides}} = \frac{50}{n}
   \]

3. **Condition for the 30-day pass to be cheaper**:
   For the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper than the one-way ticket, we need:
   \[
   \frac{2}{n} < \frac{50}{n}
   \]

4. **Simplifying the inequality**:
   Since \(n\) is a positive integer, we can cancel \(n\) from both sides of the inequality:
   \[
   2 < 50
   \]
   This inequality is always true, which means that the 30-day pass is cheaper than the one-way ticket for any number of rides \(n \geq 1\).

5. **Finding the minimum number of rides \(n\)** such that the 30-day pass becomes strictly cheaper per ride:
   Since the inequality \(2 < 50\) is always true, the 30-day pass is cheaper per ride for any number of rides \(n \geq 1\). Therefore, the minimum number of rides needed to make the 30-day pass strictly cheaper per ride is \(n = 1\).

Given this reasoning, the minimum number of rides required to ensure that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride is 1.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost per ride for both the one-way and 30-day passes.

For the one-way ticket, since you need to pay $2 for a ride, the cost per ride is $2.

For the 30-day pass, you pay $50 to access 30 rides. So, the cost per ride for the 30-day pass is $50 / 30 = $1.67 per ride.

We want to find the minimum number of rides such that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride. This means the cost of one ride with the 30-day pass should be less than the cost of one ride with the one-way ticket.

Let's set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{50}{30} < \frac{2}{1} \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ \frac{5}{3} < 2 \]

Multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

\[ 5 < 6 \]

This inequality is true, but we want it to be less than, not equal to, to ensure the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper.

To find the minimum number of rides, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies this condition.

\[ \frac{50}{30x} < \frac{2}{1} \]

Simplifying by multiplying both sides by 30x:

\[ 50 < 60 \]

Since this inequality is always true for any positive number x, we only need to focus on the condition directly:

\[ \frac{50}{30x} < \frac{2}{1} \rightarrow 50 < 2 \times 30x \rightarrow 50 < 60x \rightarrow 50/60 < x \]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[ \frac{5}{6} < x \]

Since x must be an integer (you can't take a fraction of a ride), the smallest integer greater than \(\frac{5}{6}\) is 1. 

However, this approach didn't directly help us find the minimum number of rides needed. Let's re-examine our inequality \( \frac{50}{30} < \frac{2}{1} \). We already know this is true for any number of rides, but we are looking for the minimum number of rides where the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride. 

If we choose \(x = 2\) (for example, taking 2 rides per month), the cost for 2 rides with the 30-day pass would be:

\[ \frac{50}{30 \times 2} = \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \]

And the cost for 2 rides with the one-way ticket would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Since \(\frac{5}{6} < 4\), the 30-day pass is indeed cheaper per ride when taking 2 rides per month.

Therefore, taking 2 rides per month ensures the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride.

\[ \text{Number of rides for one-way} = \frac{\$2}{\$0.07} = 28.57 \]
Since you can't take a fraction of a ride, we round up to 29 rides.

2. Compare the cost per ride for the one-way ticket and the 30-day pass:
\[ \text{Cost per ride for one-way ticket} = \frac{\$2}{29} \approx \$0.068966 \]
\[ \text{Cost per ride for 30-day pass} = \frac{\$50}{30} \approx \$1.6667 \]

Since \$0.068966 < \$1.6667, the one-way ticket is cheaper per ride for 29 rides. However, we need to find the minimum number of rides where the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride. 

3. With 30 rides, the cost per ride for the one-way ticket is:
\[ \text{Cost per ride for one-way ticket} = \frac{\$2}{30} = \$0.0667 \]
Now compare it to the cost per ride for the 30-day pass:
\[ \text{Cost per ride for 30-day pass} = \frac{\$50}{30} = \$1.6667 \]

Since \$0.0667 < \$1.6667, we can conclude that with 30 rides, the 30-day pass is cheaper per ride.

Therefore, the minimum number of rides you need to take every month for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride is 30.
