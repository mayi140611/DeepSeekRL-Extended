system
Let's denote the number of games Carla won as \( C \).

According to the problem, Frankie won half as many games as Carla. Therefore, the number of games Frankie won is \( \frac{1}{2}C \).

Since they played 30 games in total and each game results in one win, the sum of the games won by both Frankie and Carla is 30. This can be expressed as:

\[ C + \frac{1}{2}C = 30 \]

To solve for \( C \), we first combine the terms on the left side:

\[ \frac{3}{2}C = 30 \]

Next, we solve for \( C \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\[ C = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} \]

\[ C = 20 \]

So, Carla won 20 games.

system
Let's denote the number of games Frankie won as \( F \) and the number of games Carla won as \( C \).

Given that Frankie won half as many games as Carla, we can write:
\[ F = \frac{1}{2}C \]

They played a total of 30 games, so we can also write:
\[ F + C = 30 \]

Now we substitute \( F \) from the first equation into the second:
\[ \frac{1}{2}C + C = 30 \]

To find \( C \), we'll solve this equation:
\[ \frac{3}{2}C = 30 \]
\[ C = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Carla won 20 games.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the number of games Carla won as \( C \). According to the problem, Frankie won half as many games as Carla, so Frankie won \( \frac{C}{2} \) games. Since they played a total of 30 games, we can write the equation:

\[ C + \frac{C}{2} = 30 \]

To solve for \( C \), we need to combine like terms:

\[ \frac{2C}{2} + \frac{C}{2} = 30 \]
\[ \frac{3C}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[ 3C = 60 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ C = \frac{60}{3} \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Carla won 20 games.

Let's denote the number of games Carla won as \( C \). Since Frankie won half as many games as Carla, Frankie won \( \frac{C}{2} \) games.

Together, they played 30 games, so we can write the equation:
\[ C + \frac{C}{2} = 30 \]

To solve for \( C \), we first combine the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{2C}{2} + \frac{C}{2} = 30 \]
\[ \frac{3C}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

Let's denote the number of games Carla won as \( C \).

According to the problem, Frankie won half as many games as Carla, so Frankie won \( \frac{C}{2} \) games.

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won by both Frankie and Carla, which is given as 30 games. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ C + \frac{C}{2} = 30 \]

To solve for \( C \), we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]

\[ 3C = 60 \]

\[ C = 20 \]

Therefore, Carla won 20 games.

system
Let's denote the number of games Carla won as \( C \).

According to the problem, Frankie won half as many games as Carla did. So, Frankie won \( \frac{C}{2} \) games.

Since they played 30 games in total and each game has one winner, the sum of the games won by Frankie and Carla should equal 30. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ C + \frac{C}{2} = 30 \]

To solve for \( C \), we first combine the terms on the left side:

\[ \frac{2C}{2} + \frac{C}{2} = 30 \]

\[ \frac{2C + C}{2} = 30 \]

\[ \frac{3C}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

\[ 3C = 60 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ C = 20 \]

So, Carla won 20 games.

Let $F$ be the number of games Frankie won, and let $C$ be the number of games Carla won. We know that $F + C = 30$ and $F = \frac{1}{2} C$. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get
$$\frac{1}{2} C + C = 30$$
