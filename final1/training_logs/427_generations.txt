###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A frog lays her eggs over a series of 4 days.  The first day she lays 50 eggs.  The second day, she doubles her production of eggs.  The third day she lays 20 more than the second day, and the last day she doubles the first three days total.  How many eggs did the frog lay over the span of the 4 days?

system
On the second day, she lays $2(50) = 100$ eggs.
On the third day, she lays $100+20 = 120$ eggs.
The total of the first three days is $50+100+120 = 270$ eggs.
The total of all the eggs laid over four days is $270 + 2(270) = \boxed{780}$ eggs.

First, we calculate the number of eggs laid each day:
1. **First day:** 50 eggs.
2. **Second day:** double the first day = 50 * 2 = 100 eggs.
3. **Third day:** 20 more than the second day = 100 + 20 = 120 eggs.
4. **Fourth day:** double the sum of the first three days = 2 * (50 + 100 + 120) = 2 * 270 = 540 eggs.

Next, we sum the eggs laid over the four days:
50 (first day) + 100 (second day) + 120 (third day) + 540 (fourth day) = 810 eggs.

Thus, the frog laid a total of 810 eggs over the span of the 4 days.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs laid each day:

1. **First day**: The frog lays 50 eggs.

2. **Second day**: The frog doubles her production from the first day, so she lays \(50 \times 2 = 100\) eggs.

3. **Third day**: The frog lays 20 more eggs than the second day, so she lays \(100 + 20 = 120\) eggs.

4. **Fourth day**: The frog doubles the total number of eggs laid over the first three days. The total for the first three days is \(50 + 100 + 120 = 270\). Thus, on the fourth day, she lays \(270 \times 2 = 540\) eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs laid over the four days:
- First day: 50 eggs
- Second day: 100 eggs
- Third day: 120 eggs
- Fourth day: 540 eggs

Total: \(50 + 100 + 120 + 540 = 810\) eggs.

Thus, the frog laid a total of 810 eggs over the span of the 4 days.

On the first day, the frog lays 50 eggs.

On the second day, she doubles that, laying \(2 \times 50 = 100\) eggs.

On the third day, she lays 20 more than the second day, laying \(100 + 20 = 120\) eggs.

The total for the first three days is \(50 + 100 + 120 = 270\) eggs.

On the last day, she doubles the total of the first three days, laying \(2 \times 270 = 540\) eggs.

So, across the 4 days, the frog lays \(270 + 540 = 810\) eggs.

First, we calculate the number of eggs laid each day:

- Day 1: 50 eggs
- Day 2: 50 eggs (doubled from Day 1) = 50 * 2 = 100 eggs
- Day 3: 100 eggs (Day 2) + 20 = 120 eggs
- Day 4: 2 * (50 + 100 + 120) = 2 * 270 = 540 eggs

Now, we sum the number of eggs laid over the four days:

50 + 100 + 120 + 540 = 810 eggs

Therefore, the frog laid 810 eggs over the span of the 4 days.

To find the total number of eggs laid by the frog over the 4 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs laid each day and then sum them up.

1. On the first day, the frog lays 50 eggs.
2. On the second day, she doubles her production from the first day, which means she lays \(2 \times 50 = 100\) eggs.
3. On the third day, she lays 20 more than the second day, so she lays \(100 + 20 = 120\) eggs.
4. On the last day, she doubles the total number of eggs laid over the first three days. The total from the first three days is \(50 + 100 + 120 = 270\) eggs. So, on the fourth day, she lays \(2 \times 270 = 540\) eggs.
