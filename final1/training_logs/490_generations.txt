###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Before getting to work, Jess has a few errands to run. Jess has to walk 11 blocks to the store and 6 blocks to the gallery, before walking the final 8 blocks to arrive at work. If Jess has already walked 5 blocks, how many more blocks must she walk before arriving at work?

To determine how many more blocks Jess must walk before arriving at work, we need to calculate the total number of blocks she needs to walk and subtract the number of blocks she has already walked.

First, let's find the total number of blocks Jess needs to walk to get to work:

- Walk to the store: 11 blocks
- Walk to the gallery: 6 blocks
- Walk to work: 8 blocks

Adding these together gives:
\[ 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 \text{ blocks} \]

Next, we subtract the number of blocks Jess has already walked:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ blocks} \]

So, Jess needs to walk 20 more blocks before arriving at work.

To determine how many more blocks Jess must walk before arriving at work, we first need to calculate the total number of blocks she needs to walk. This can be done by summing the blocks for each of her errands and the final blocks to work.

Jess:
1. Walks to the store: 11 blocks
2. Walks to the gallery: 6 blocks
3. Walks to work: 8 blocks

So, the total number of blocks Jess needs to walk is:

\[ 11 \text{ blocks} + 6 \text{ blocks} + 8 \text{ blocks} \]

\[ = 25 \text{ blocks} \]

Next, we know that Jess has already walked 5 blocks. To find out how many more blocks she must walk, we subtract the blocks she has already walked from the total number of blocks.

\[ \text{Blocks remaining} = \text{Total blocks} - \text{Blocks already walked} \]

\[ \text{Blocks remaining} = 25 \text{ blocks} - 5 \text{ blocks} \]

\[ \text{Blocks remaining} = 20 \text{ blocks} \]

So, Jess must walk 20 more blocks before arriving at work.

To determine how many more blocks Jess must walk before arriving at work, we first need to calculate the total number of blocks she plans to walk. This can be done by summing the blocks for each leg of her journey:

1. Walking to the store: 11 blocks
2. Walking to the gallery: 6 blocks
3. Walking to work: 8 blocks

Adding these together gives:

\[ 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 \]

So, Jess plans to walk a total of 25 blocks.

Next, we know that she has already walked 5 blocks. To find out how many more blocks she needs to walk, we subtract the blocks she has already walked from the total number of blocks:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, Jess must walk 20 more blocks to arrive at work.

To find out how many more blocks Jess has to walk before arriving at work, we first need to calculate the total number of blocks she has to walk all together. 

Total blocks = Blocks to the store + Blocks to the gallery + Final blocks
Total blocks = 11 blocks + 6 blocks + 8 blocks
Total blocks = 25 blocks

Jess has already walked 5 blocks. 

So the remaining blocks she has to walk before arriving at work will be the total blocks minus the blocks she has already walked.

Remaining blocks = Total blocks - Walked blocks
Remaining blocks = 25 blocks - 5 blocks
Remaining blocks = 20 blocks

Therefore, Jess has to walk 20 more blocks before arriving at work.

To find out how many more blocks Jess must walk before arriving at work, we need to add up the total number of blocks she needs to walk and then subtract the number of blocks she has already walked. The total number of blocks Jess needs to walk can be found by adding the blocks to the store, the blocks to the gallery, and the blocks to work.

Total blocks to walk = blocks to the store + blocks to the gallery + blocks to work
Total blocks to walk = 11 blocks + 6 blocks + 8 blocks
Total blocks to walk = 25 blocks

Now, subtract the number of blocks Jess has already walked from the total number of blocks.

Remaining blocks to walk = Total blocks to walk - blocks walked
Remaining blocks to walk = 25 blocks - 5 blocks
Remaining blocks to walk = 20 blocks

Therefore, Jess must walk 20 more blocks before arriving at work.

To determine how many more blocks Jess must walk before arriving at work, we start by calculating the total number of blocks she needs to walk. This includes the blocks to the store, the blocks to the gallery, and the final blocks to work. We can add these together:

Blocks to the store: 11
Blocks to the gallery: 6
Final blocks to work: 8

Total blocks = 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 blocks

Jess has already walked 5 blocks. To find out how many more blocks she must walk, we subtract the blocks she has already walked from the total number of blocks:

25 blocks (total) - 5 blocks (walked) = 20 blocks

Therefore, Jess must walk 20 more blocks before arriving at work.

To determine how many more blocks Jess must walk before arriving at work, we first need to calculate the total number of blocks she has already walked. She has walked 11 blocks to the store, 6 blocks to the gallery, and 8 blocks to work. The total number of blocks she has walked so far is:

\[ 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 \text{ blocks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more blocks she must walk to reach her final destination. The total number of blocks to work is the sum of the blocks to the store, the blocks to the gallery, and the final 8 blocks to work. Therefore, the total number of blocks to work is:

\[ 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 \text{ blocks} \]

Jess has already walked 25 blocks, which is exactly the total number of blocks to work. Therefore, she has walked all the blocks required to arrive at work. The number of blocks she still needs to walk is:

\[ 25 - 25 = 0 \]

So, Jess does not need to walk any more blocks before arriving at work.

To determine how many more blocks Jess needs to walk before arriving at work, we first calculate the total number of blocks she has walked and the total number of blocks she needs to walk.

1. The total number of blocks to the store is 11.
2. The total number of blocks to the gallery is 6.
3. The final blocks to work are 8.

First, we find the total number of blocks in all these segments combined:
\[ 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 \]
So, Jess has walked 25 blocks so far.

Next, we subtract the number of blocks she has already walked from the total number of blocks she needs to walk:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, Jess must walk 20 more blocks before arriving at work.

To determine how many more blocks Jess must walk before arriving at work, follow these steps:

1. **Total Distance to Work**: 
   - Jess needs to walk 11 blocks to the store.
   - After the store, she needs to walk 6 blocks to the gallery.
   - Finally, she needs to walk 8 blocks to arrive at work.
   Adding these distances together:
   \[
   11 \text{ blocks (store)} + 6 \text{ blocks (gallery)} + 8 \text{ blocks (work)} = 25 \text{ blocks}
   \]

2. **Distance Jess Has Already Walked**:
   - Jess has already walked 5 blocks.

3. **Remaining Distance**:
   - To find out how many more blocks Jess must walk, subtract the distance she has already walked from the total distance to work:
   \[
   25 \text{ blocks (total)} - 5 \text{ blocks (already walked)} = 20 \text{ blocks}
   \]

Thus, Jess must walk 20 more blocks to arrive at work.

To determine how many more blocks Jess must walk before arriving at work, let's follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total number of blocks Jess needs to walk to reach work:
   - Walk to the store: 11 blocks
   - Walk to the gallery: 6 blocks
   - Walk to work: 8 blocks

   Total blocks to work = 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 blocks

2. Jess has already walked 5 blocks. To find out how many more blocks she needs to walk, we subtract the number of blocks she has already walked from the total number of blocks required to walk to work:

   Remaining blocks = Total blocks to work - Blocks already walked
   Remaining blocks = 25 - 5 = 20 blocks

3. According to the given information, Jess has to walk the remaining blocks to arrive at work.

4. Since Jess has already walked 5 blocks, we need to subtract this from the remaining blocks she needs to walk:

   Remaining blocks to walk = Remaining blocks - Blocks already walked
   Remaining blocks to walk = 20 - 5 = 15 blocks

**Conclusion: Jess must walk 15 more blocks before arriving at work.**

First, we need to calculate the total number of blocks Jess has to walk. This is given by the sum of blocks to the store, blocks to the gallery, and the final blocks to work.

\[11 \text{ blocks to the store} + 6 \text{ blocks to the gallery} + 8 \text{ blocks to work} = 25 \text{ blocks}\]

Jess has already walked 5 blocks. To find out how many more blocks she needs to walk, we subtract the blocks she has already walked from the total blocks:

\[25 \text{ blocks} - 5 \text{ blocks} = 20 \text{ blocks}\]
