<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of cards Lloyd has as \( L \), Mark has as \( M \), and Michael has as \( M \) (since Michael's cards are equal to the total number of cards he has now).

We know that Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd, so:
\[ M = 3L \]

Mark also has 10 fewer cards than Michael, so we can write:
\[ M = M - 10 \]
Considering these, the number of cards Michael has is:
\[ M = 100 \]

Now, substituting the number of cards Michael has into the equation from above:
\[ 100 = M - 10 \]
\[ 100 + 10 = M \]
\[ M = 110 \]

Using the same logic for Mark:
\[ M = 3L \]
\[ 110 = 3L \]
\[ L = \frac{110}{3} \]
\[ L \approx 36.67 \]

So, Lloyd has approximately 36.67 cards. To find the total number of cards they currently have, add all three:
\[ L + M + M = 36.67 + 110 + 110 = 256.67 \]

They want to have a total of 300 cards. To find out how many more cards they need, subtract the current total from the required total:
\[ 300 - 256.67 = 43.33 \]

Therefore, they need to collect approximately 43.33 more cards.

Let's denote the number of cards Lloyd has as L, Mark as M, and Michael as R. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd: \( M = 3L \).
2. Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael: \( M = R - 10 \).
3. Michael has 100 cards now: \( R = 100 \).

From the third point, we can substitute \( R \) into the second equation to find how many cards Mark has:
\[ M = 100 - 10 \]
\[ M = 90 \]

Now, we substitute \( M \) into the first equation to find how many cards Lloyd has:
\[ 90 = 3L \]
\[ L = 30 \]

So, Lloyd has 30 cards, Mark has 90, and Michael has 100 cards.

To find out how many more cards they should collect so that they will have a total of 300 cards, we first calculate the current total number of cards:
\[ L + M + R = 30 + 90 + 100 = 220 \]

The additional number of cards they need to reach 300 is:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, they need to collect 80 more cards.

Let's denote the number of cards Lloyd has as \( L \), Mark as \( M \), and Michael as \( T \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( M = 3L \) (Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd)
2. \( M = T - 10 \) (Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael)
3. \( T = 100 \) (Michael currently has 100 cards)

First, substitute \( T = 100 \) into the second equation to find \( M \):
\[ M = T - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90 \]

Now, substitute \( M = 90 \) into the first equation to find \( L \):
\[ M = 3L \]
\[ 90 = 3L \]
\[ L = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Now we know Lloyd has 30 cards, Mark has 90 cards, and Michael has 100 cards. To find out how many more cards they need to collect so that the total number of cards reaches 300, we calculate the current total number of cards and subtract from 300:
\[ \text{Current total} = L + M + T = 30 + 90 + 100 = 220 \]
\[ \text{Required total} = 300 \]
\[ \text{Additional cards needed} = 300 - 220 = 80 \]

So, Lloyd, Mark, and Michael should collect 80 more cards to have a total of 300 cards.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current number of cards each person has. We know that Michael has 100 cards.

Since Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael, Mark currently has:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

Mark also has thrice as many cards as Lloyd. Thus, if Lloyd has \( L \) cards, then:
\[ 90 = 3L \]
\[ L = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

So, Lloyd currently has 30 cards.

Now, we need to find out how many cards they need to collect collectively to have a total of 300 cards. Initially, they have:
\[ 30 + 90 + 100 = 220 \]

Therefore, they need to collect:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

So, they should collect a total of 80 cards.

Let's denote the number of cards Lloyd has as \( L \).

According to the given information:
1. Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd, so Mark has \( 3L \) cards.
2. Mark also has 10 fewer cards than Michael, so Michael has \( 3L + 10 \) cards. We know Michael has 100 cards, so we can set up the equation \( 3L + 10 = 100 \).

To find \( L \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3L + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 3L = 90 \]
\[ L = 30 \]
So, Lloyd currently has 30 cards.

Now, since Michael has 100 cards, and Mark has \( 3L \) cards, we calculate:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]
So, Mark has 90 cards.

To find the total number of cards Lloyd, Mark, and Michael have now:
\[ L + 3L + 3L = 30 + 90 + 100 = 220 \]

They want to have a total of 300 cards, so they need:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]
cards in total.

Finally, to have 80 additional cards, they should collect \( 80 \) cards in total.

Given that Michael currently has 100 cards, and Michael has 10 fewer cards than Mark, Mark currently has \(100 + 10 = 110\) cards. According to the problem, Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd, so Lloyd currently has \(110 / 3\) cards, which is approximately 36.67 cards. Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we can assume Lloyd has 36 cards (if rounding down to the nearest whole number, which might not fit perfectly).

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards they already have:
- Lloyd: 36 cards
- Mark: 110 cards
- Michael: 100 cards
- Total: \(36 + 110 + 100 = 246\) cards

They need a total of 300 cards, so they need to collect \(300 - 246 = 54\) cards.

Let's start by defining the number of cards each person currently has. We know that Michael has 100 cards.

Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael, so Mark has \( 100 - 10 = 90 \) cards.

Mark also has thrice as many cards as Lloyd. Therefore, Lloyd has \( \frac{90}{3} = 30 \) cards.

Now, we need to find out the total number of cards they currently have together. Mark, Lloyd, and Michael have \( 90 + 30 + 100 = 220 \) cards.

To have a total of 300 cards, they need to collect \( 300 - 220 = 80 \) more cards.

Let's denote the number of cards Lloyd, Mark, and Michael have as L, M, and M+10 respectively, since Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael. We know that M = 100, so Mark has M + 10 = 110 cards.

According to the problem, Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd, so L = M/3. Since M = 100, we have L = 100/3, which is not an integer. This indicates that the problem might have a typo, or we need to make sure our interpretation is correct.

Given that Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael, and Michael has 100 cards, Mark must have 100 - 10 = 90 cards. This contradicts the earlier statement that Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd. We need to clarify whether Mark has 90 cards or not.

Given that Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael, and Michael has 100 cards, Mark must have 100 - 10 = 90 cards. Since Mark's number of cards is half of Lloyd's, and Mark has 90 cards, Lloyd must have 90 * 2 = 180 cards.

Now we have:
- Lloyd: 180 cards
- Mark: 90 cards
- Michael: 100 cards

The total number of cards they currently have is 180 + 90 + 100 = 370 cards.

To have a total of 300 cards, they need to collect 370 - 300 = 70 cards.

Let's denote the number of cards Lloyd has as \( L \).

According to the problem, Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd. Therefore, Mark has \( 3L \) cards.

Mark also has 10 fewer cards than Michael, so Michael has \( 3L + 10 \) cards.

We know that Michael has 100 cards, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3L + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( L \), we can solve this equation:
\[ 3L = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 3L = 90 \]
\[ L = 30 \]

So Lloyd has 30 cards.

Now we find out how many cards Mark has:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Mark has 90 cards.

We know Michael has 100 cards, so the total number of cards they currently have is:
\[ 30 + 90 + 100 = 220 \]

They aim to have a total of 300 cards. So the number of additional cards they need to collect is:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, they should collect 80 more cards.

Let's denote the number of cards Lloyd has as $L$, the number of cards Mark has as $M$, and the number of cards Michael has as $T$.

From the problem, we know that:
- Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd, so $M = 3L$.
- Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael, so $M = T - 10$.
- Michael has 100 cards, so $T = 100$.

We can substitute these values into the equations to find $L$ and $M$:
- From $T = 100$, we get $M = 100 - 10 = 90$.
- Since $M = 3L$, we substitute $M$ to get $90 = 3L$.
- Solving for $L$, we get $L = \frac{90}{3} = 30$.

Now, we need to find out how many more cards they need to collect together to reach a total of 300 cards. The total number of cards they currently have is:
\[L + M + T = 30 + 90 + 100 = 220.\]

They need 180 more cards to reach 300.

The total number of additional cards they need is therefore 180.

Let's denote the number of cards Lloyd has as \(L\), Mark has as \(M\), and Michael has as \(M\), given he has 100 cards. According to the problem, Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd, so \(M = 3 \cdot L\). We also know that Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael, so \(M = M - 10\).
