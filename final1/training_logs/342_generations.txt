To determine how long Mark was on the sideline, we need to add the time he played and subtract it from the total game duration. Mark played for a total of 55 minutes: 20 + 35 = 55. Then, we subtract this from the total game time of 90 minutes to get the number of minutes he was on the sideline: 90 - 55 = 35 minutes. Therefore, Mark was on the sideline for 35 minutes.

To find out how long Mark was on the sideline, we first need to calculate the total time he spent playing. We add the time he played in the first 20 minutes to the time he played in the second 35 minutes. Then we subtract this total from the overall playtime of 90 minutes.

\( \text{Total playtime} = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

\( \text{Time in the first break} = 20 \text{ minutes} \)

\( \text{Time in the second break} = 35 \text{ minutes} \)

\( \text{Total break time} = \text{Total playtime} - (\text{Time in the first break} + \text{Time in the second break}) \)

\( \text{Total break time} = 90 \text{ minutes} - (20 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes}) \)

\( \text{Total break time} = 90 \text{ minutes} - 55 \text{ minutes} \)

\( \text{Total break time} = 35 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, let's do the calculation:

\( 90 - 20 = 70 \)

\( 70 - 35 = 35 \)

So, Mark was on the sideline for 35 minutes.

To find out how long Mark was on the sideline, we need to add the duration of the game he played to the rest period and subtract the duration of the game he played.

Game duration (Mark's first play) = 20 minutes
Rest period duration = 35 minutes
Game duration (Mark's second play) = 35 minutes

Total time playing = 20 minutes (first play) + 35 minutes (rest period) + 35 minutes (second play) = 90 minutes

Since the total time of the game is 90 minutes and Mark played for a total of 90 minutes, he did not rest during the game. Therefore, the time he was on the sideline is 0 minutes.

To find out how long Mark was on the sideline, we need to subtract the total time he played from the duration of the game.

Total time of the game = 90 minutes
Time Mark played 1st time = 20 minutes
Time Mark played 2nd time = 35 minutes

Total time Mark played = 20 + 35 = 55 minutes

Time Mark was on the sideline = Total game duration - Time Mark played

Time Mark was on the sideline = 90 - 55 = 35 minutes

Therefore, Mark was on the sideline for 35 minutes.

To determine how long Mark was on the sideline, we first need to calculate the total time he spent playing. 

Mark played for 20 minutes initially and then for another 35 minutes. Summing these times gives:
\[ 20 + 35 = 55 \text{ minutes} \]

The total duration of the soccer game was 90 minutes. To find out how long he was on the sideline, we subtract the time he spent playing from the total duration of the game:
\[ 90 - 55 = 35 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Mark was on the sideline for 35 minutes.

First, we need to determine the total duration of Mark's playing time. He played for 20 minutes initially and then for another 35 minutes, so:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes} = 55 \text{ minutes} \]

The total duration of the game is 90 minutes, so the time Mark was on the sideline is:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} - 55 \text{ minutes} = 35 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Mark was on the sideline for 35 minutes.
