system
To find out how many marbles Mabel has, we multiply the number of marbles Katrina has by 5, since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. But since we know Mabel has 85 marbles, we can say that Katrina has \( \frac{85}{5} = 17 \) marbles.

Now, according to the question, Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. So Amanda has \( 2 \times 17 - 12 = 34 - 12 = 22 \) marbles.

Mabel has 85 marbles and Amanda has 22 marbles, so Mabel has \( 85 - 22 = 63 \) more marbles than Amanda.

To determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we first need to find out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina and that Mabel has 85 marbles. So, we can write the following equation:

\[ 5 \times \text{Katrina's marbles} = 85 \]

Solving for Katrina's marbles, we get:

\[ \text{Katrina's marbles} = \frac{85}{5} = 17 \]

Now, we know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. Since Katrina has 17 marbles, twice that number would be:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

So, Amanda needs to have 34 marbles. Therefore, Amanda currently has:

\[ 34 - 12 = 22 \text{ marbles} \]

Mabel has 85 marbles, and Amanda has 22 marbles. To find out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we subtract Amanda's number of marbles from Mabel's number of marbles:

\[ 85 - 22 = 63 \]

Thus, Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda.

Katrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.
Twice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 * 2 = 34.
Amanda has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.
Mabel has 85 - 17 = 68 marbles.

68 - 22 = 46

Let's denote the number of marbles Katrina has as \( K \).

According to the problem:
1. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina.
   So, Amanda has \( 2K - 12 \) marbles.
   
2. Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina.
   So, Mabel has \( 5K \).

3. We are given that Mabel has 85 marbles.
   Therefore, \( 5K = 85 \) and solving for \( K \), we get:
   \[
   K = \frac{85}{5} = 17
   \]

4. Now, using the number of marbles Katrina has (\( K = 17 \)), we can find out how many marbles Amanda has:
   \[
   2K - 12 = 2 \times 17 - 12 = 34 - 12 = 22
   \]

5. To find out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we subtract the number of marbles Amanda has from the number of marbles Mabel has:
   \[
   85 - 22 = 63
   \]

Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles. So Katrina has \( \frac{85}{5} = 17 \) marbles.

Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. Katrina has 17 marbles, so twice that amount is \( 2 \times 17 = 34 \) marbles. Therefore, Amanda needs \( 34 - 12 = 22 \) more marbles to have 34 marbles.

Mabel has 85 marbles, and Amanda needs 12 more to have twice as many as Katrina, so Mabel still has 85 marbles after Amanda gets the 12 more.

To find out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we subtract Amanda's 12 more marbles from Mabel's:
\( 85 - 12 = 73 \).

Thus, Mabel has 73 more marbles than Amanda.

Let's denote the number of marbles Katrina has as K. Since Mabel has 85 marbles, which is 5 times as many as Katrina, we can write:

\[ 85 = 5K \]

From this, we can solve for K:

\[ K = \frac{85}{5} = 17 \]

So, Katrina has 17 marbles.

Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. Therefore, Amanda has:

\[ 2K - 12 = 2(17) - 12 = 34 - 12 = 22 \]

Amanda has 22 marbles.

To find out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we subtract Amanda's number of marbles from Mabel's:

\[ 85 - 22 = 63 \]

Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda.

To find out how many marbles Amanda has, let's denote Katrina's marbles as \( x \).
According to the information given, Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, so Mabel has \( 5x \) marbles.
Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up the equation \( 5x = 85 \).
Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 17 \).

Now, Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. Since Katrina has 17 marbles, Amanda will have \( 2 \times 17 - 12 = 34 - 12 = 22 \) marbles.

Mabel has 85 marbles, and Amanda has 22 marbles, so Mabel has \( 85 - 22 = 63 \) more marbles than Amanda.

Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina, which means Amanda's marbles plus 12 are twice as many as Katrina's marbles. Let's call the number of marbles Katrina has \( K \). According to the problem, Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles. Therefore, Katrina has \( 85 / 5 = 17 \) marbles. 

Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina, which means Amanda has \( 17 + 12 = 29 \) marbles. 

Mabel has 85 marbles, and Amanda has 29 marbles, so Mabel has \( 85 - 29 = 56 \) more marbles than Amanda.
