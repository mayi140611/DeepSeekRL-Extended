To determine how many dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make, we first calculate how many appetizers are required for her guests.

1. Patsy has 30 guests.
2. Each guest needs 6 appetizers.
3. Total appetizers needed = 30 guests * 6 appetizers/guest = 180 appetizers.

Next, we calculate the number of appetizers Patsy is already making:

4. Deviled eggs: 3 dozen
5. Pigs in a blanket: 2 dozen
6. Kebabs: 2 dozen

Total appetizers from deviled eggs, pigs in a blanket, and kebabs = 3 dozen + 2 dozen + 2 dozen = 7 dozen.

Now, we find out how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs by subtracting the number of appetizers she is making from the total number needed:

7 dozen (already made) - 180 appetizers (total needed) = -173 dozen.

This negative value indicates that Patsy has already made more appetizers than required. Therefore, she does not need to make any more dozen appetizers.

First, we need to determine the total number of appetizers Patsy needs. She has 30 guests and each needs 6 appetizers, so the total required is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) appetizers.

Next, we calculate how many appetizers she is currently making:
- Deviled eggs: 3 dozen = \(3 \times 12 = 36\) appetizers
- Pigs in a blanket: 2 dozen = \(2 \times 12 = 24\) appetizers
- Kebabs: 2 dozen = \(2 \times 12 = 24\) appetizers

Adding these up, the total number of appetizers she is making is \(36 + 24 + 24 = 84\) appetizers.

To find out how many more dozen appetizers she needs to make, we subtract the number of appetizers she is making from the number she needs: \(180 - 84 = 96\).

Since there are 12 appetizers in a dozen, we divide 96 by 12: \(96 \div 12 = 8\) dozen.

Therefore, Patsy needs to make 8 more dozen appetizers.

First, we need to find the total number of appetizers Patsy needs. She needs 6 appetizers per guest, and she has 30 guests, so the total number of appetizers needed is:
6 appetizers/guest * 30 guests = 180 appetizers

Next, we need to find out how many dozen appetizers Patsy has already made. She has made 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, and 2 dozen kebabs, so the total number of dozen appetizers she has made is:
3 dozen + 2 dozen + 2 dozen = 7 dozen appetizers

Now, we need to find out how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make. She needs 180 appetizers in total and has already made 7 dozen, so the number of additional dozen appetizers she needs to make is:
180 appetizers - 7 dozen = 180 appetizers - 7 * 12 dozen = 180 - 84 = 96 appetizers

Since each dozen contains 12 appetizers, we can calculate how many more dozen appetizers she needs to make:
96 appetizers / 12 appetizers/dozen = 8 dozen appetizers

Therefore, Patsy needs to make 8 more dozen appetizers.

To determine how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make, we first calculate the total number of appetizers she needs.

Patsy has 30 guests, and she needs 6 appetizers per guest. Hence, the total number of appetizers needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ guests} \times 6 \text{ appetizers/guest} = 180 \text{ appetizers} \]

Next, we calculate how many appetizers she has already made. She has made 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, and 2 dozen kebabs.

First, convert the number of dozen appetizers she has made into individual appetizers:
\[ 3 \text{ dozen deviled eggs} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ appetizers} \]
\[ 2 \text{ dozen pigs in a blanket} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ appetizers} \]
\[ 2 \text{ dozen kebabs} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ appetizers} \]

Then, sum these to get the total number of appetizers she has made:
\[ 36 \text{ deviled eggs} + 24 \text{ pigs in a blanket} + 24 \text{ kebabs} = 84 \text{ appetizers} \]

Now, subtract the number of appetizers she has made from the total number needed to find out how many more appetizers she needs:
\[ 180 \text{ appetizers needed} - 84 \text{ appetizers made} = 96 \text{ appetizers} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining appetizers from individual appetizers to dozens:
\[ \frac{96 \text{ appetizers}}{12 \text{ appetizers/dozen}} = 8 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Patsy needs to make 8 more dozen appetizers.

To determine how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of appetizers required and then subtract the number of appetizers she is currently making.

Patsy has 30 guests and she needs 6 appetizers per guest.
So, the total number of appetizers required is:
\[ 30 \text{ guests} \times 6 \text{ appetizers/guest} = 180 \text{ appetizers} \]

Next, we need to convert these appetizers into dozens. Since there are 12 appetizers in a dozen, we divide the total number of appetizers by 12:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ appetizers}}{12 \text{ appetizers/dozen}} = 15 \text{ dozen} \]

Patsy is currently making 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, and 2 dozen kebabs. To find the total number of dozen appetizers she is making, we sum the number of dozens:
\[ 3 \text{ dozen} + 2 \text{ dozen} + 2 \text{ dozen} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

To find out how many more dozen appetizers she needs to make, we subtract the number of dozen appetizers she is making from the total number of dozen appetizers required:
\[ 15 \text{ dozen} - 7 \text{ dozen} = 8 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, Patsy needs to make 8 more dozen appetizers.

First, let's calculate the total number of appetizers Patsy needs. She has 30 guests and each guest requires 6 appetizers. This gives us a total of \(30 \times 6 = 180\) appetizers needed.

Next, let's calculate how many appetizers she is currently making. She is making 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, and 2 dozen kebabs. Since 1 dozen equals 12, she is making \(3 \times 12 = 36\) deviled eggs, \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pigs in a blanket, and \(2 \times 12 = 24\) kebabs. Adding these up gives us a total of \(36 + 24 + 24 = 84\) appetizers.

To find out how many more dozen appetizers she needs to make, we subtract the total number of appetizers she is making from the total number she needs. \(180 - 84 = 96\). Since 96 is equivalent to 8 dozen (because \(96 / 12 = 8\)), she needs to make 8 more dozen appetizers.

First, we need to calculate the total number of appetizers that Patsy needs for her guests. Since she expects 30 guests and each guest needs 6 appetizers, she will need a total of \( 30 \times 6 = 180 \) appetizers.

Next, we calculate the number of appetizers already prepared by Patsy. She is making:
- 3 dozen deviled eggs, which is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) appetizers,
- 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, which is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) appetizers,
- 2 dozen kebabs, which is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) appetizers.

Adding these together, she has prepared \( 36 + 24 + 24 = 84 \) appetizers.

Now, to find out how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make, we first calculate the shortfall between the total needed and the ones already prepared. The shortfall is \( 180 - 84 = 96 \) appetizers.

Since there are 12 appetizers in a dozen, we convert the shortfall into dozens: \( 96 \div 12 = 8 \) dozen appetizers.

Thus, Patsy needs to make 8 more dozen appetizers.

First, we need to determine the total number of appetizers Patsy should have. She needs 6 appetizers per guest, and she has 30 guests, so the total number of appetizers she should have is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) appetizers.

Next, we'll calculate how many appetizers Patsy has made so far. She has made 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, and 2 dozen kebabs. Since one dozen equals 12, \(3 \times 12 = 36\) deviled eggs, \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pigs in a blanket, and \(2 \times 12 = 24\) kebabs. Adding these together, Patsy has made \(36 + 24 + 24 = 84\) appetizers.

Now, we need to find out how many more appetizers Patsy needs to reach her goal of 180 appetizers. She needs \(180 - 84 = 96\) more appetizers.

Since each dozen equals 12 appetizers, we need to convert 96 into dozens. \(96 \div 12 = 8\) dozens. So, Patsy needs to make 8 more dozen appetizers.

First, we need to calculate the total number of appetizers needed for Patsy's guests. Since she needs 6 appetizers per guest, and she has 30 guests, the total number of appetizers needed is:
6 appetizers/guest * 30 guests = 180 appetizers.

Next, we need to calculate the number of appetizers Patsy is currently making. She is making 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, and 2 dozen kebabs. Since there are 12 appetizers in a dozen, we can calculate the total number of appetizers as follows:
(3 dozen * 12 appetizers/dozen) + (2 dozen * 12 appetizers/dozen) + (2 dozen * 12 appetizers/dozen) = 36 appetizers + 24 appetizers + 24 appetizers = 84 appetizers.

Finally, we need to find out how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make to reach her goal. We can do this by subtracting the number of appetizers she is currently making from the total number she needs:
180 appetizers - 84 appetizers = 96 appetizers.

Since there are 12 appetizers in a dozen, we can now calculate how many more dozens of appetizers Patsy needs to make:
96 appetizers / 12 appetizers/dozen = 8 dozen.

Therefore, Patsy needs to make 8 more dozen appetizers.

To determine how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make, let's follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of appetizers needed for her guests:
   - Patsy has 30 guests
   - Each guest needs 6 appetizers
   - Total appetizers needed = 30 guests * 6 appetizers/guest = 180 appetizers

2. Calculate the total number of appetizers Patsy is already making:
   - Deviled eggs: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 appetizers
   - Pigs in a blanket: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 appetizers
   - Kebabs: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 appetizers (already included in the previous step)
   
   Total appetizers made = 180 (needed) - (36 + 24) = 180 - 60 = 120 appetizers

3. Determine how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make:
   - She has already made 120 appetizers, but she needs 180 appetizers
   - Number of additional appetizers needed = 180 - 120 = 60 appetizers
   - Number of additional dozen appetizers needed = 60 / 12 = 5 dozen

Next, we need to determine the number of appetizers Patsy has already made. She has made 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, and 2 dozen kebabs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 appetizers, we can calculate the number of each type of appetizer she has made:

The total number of appetizers Patsy has made is the sum of the appetizers of each type:

To determine how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of appetizers required and then compare it to the number of appetizers she is already making.

1. Calculate the total number of appetizers needed:
   - Patsy has 30 guests.
   - She needs 6 appetizers per guest.
   - Total appetizers needed = \(30 \times 6 = 180\).

2. Calculate the total number of appetizers she is making:
   - She is making 3 dozen deviled eggs.
   - 1 dozen = 12 appetizers.
   - Total deviled eggs = \(3 \times 12 = 36\).
   - She is also making 2 dozen pigs in a blanket.
   - Total pigs in a blanket = \(2 \times 12 = 24\).
   - She is making 2 dozen kebabs.
   - Total kebabs = \(2 \times 12 = 24\).

3. Add up all the appetizers she is making:
   - Total appetizers making = \(36 + 24 + 24 = 84\).

4. Determine how many more appetizers are needed:
   - Total appetizers needed = 180.
   - Appetizers made = 84.
   - Remaining appetizers needed = \(180 - 84 = 96\).

5. Convert remaining appetizers to dozens:
   - 1 dozen = 12 appetizers.
   - Number of dozens remaining to make = \(96 \div 12 = 8\).

Therefore, Patsy needs to make 8 more dozen appetizers.
