Jenny wants to print 7 copies of her 25-page essay, so that's 7 * 25 = 175 pages to print. Printing these pages costs 175 * 0.10 = $17.50. Additionally, Jenny wants to buy 7 pens at $1.50 each, which totals 7 * 1.50 = $10.50. In total, Jenny will spend 17.50 + 10.50 = $28.00. Jenny pays with 2 twenty dollar bills, which equals 2 * 20 = $40.00. Therefore, she should get 40 - 28 = $12.00 in change.

Cost to print one page: $.10
Total pages to be printed: 7 copies * 25 pages = 175 pages
Cost to print 175 pages: 175 * $.10 = $17.50
Cost of 7 pens: 7 * $1.50 = $10.50
Total cost: $17.50 + $10.50 = $28.00

Amount paid: 2 twenty dollar bills = $40.00

First, calculate the cost of printing the essay. Jenny wants to print 7 copies of a 25-page essay, so the cost for printing is 7 * 25 = $175. Then, calculate the cost of the pens. Each pen costs $1.50 and she needs 7, so the total cost for the pens is 7 * $1.50 = $10.50. Add the printing cost and the pen cost to find the total cost. The total cost is $175 + $10.50 = $185. Jenny pays with 2 twenty dollar bills, which total to $40. To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount paid: $40 - $185 = -$145. Since this results in a negative number, it indicates she does not have enough money. She should get back $145 in excess. <answer>

To determine how much money Jenny should get in change, we need to calculate the total cost of printing the essays and the pens.

First, calculate the cost of printing the essays:
- Each essay is 25 pages.
- Jenny wants to print 7 copies.
- It costs $0.10 to print one page.

\[
\text{Total number of pages} = 25 \, \text{pages/essay} \times 7 \, \text{essays} = 175 \, \text{pages}
\]

\[
\text{Cost per page} = 0.10 \, dollars
\]

\[
\text{Total printing cost} = 175 \, \text{pages} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/page} = 17.50 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, calculate the cost of the pens:
- Jenny wants to buy 7 pens.
- Each pen costs $1.50.

\[
\text{Total cost of pens} = 7 \, \text{pens} \times 1.50 \, \text{dollars/pens} = 10.50 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, add the total printing cost and the total cost of the pens to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 17.50 \, \text{dollars (printing)} + 10.50 \, \text{dollars (pens)} = 28.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Jenny pays with 2 twenty dollar bills, which totals:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 2 \times 20 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Finally, calculate the change Jenny should receive:

\[
\text{Change} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 28.00 \, \text{dollars} = 12.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]

Therefore, Jenny should get $12.00 in change.

To determine how much money Jenny should get in change, we need to calculate the total cost of printing her essays and pens, and then subtract this total from the amount she paid.

1. Calculate the cost of printing the essays:
   - Jenny wants to print 7 copies of a 25-page essay.
   - The cost to print one page is $0.10.
   - Therefore, the cost to print one essay is:
     \[
     25 \text{ pages/essay} \times 7 \text{ essays} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/page} = 17.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total cost to print all 7 essays is:
     \[
     17.50 \text{ dollars} \times 7 \text{ essays} = 122.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. Calculate the cost of buying the pens:
   - Each pen costs $1.50.
   - Jenny wants to buy 7 pens.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the pens is:
     \[
     7 \text{ pens} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/pen} = 10.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. Calculate the total amount spent:
   - The total cost of printing the essays is $122.50.
   - The total cost of the pens is $10.50.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent is:
     \[
     122.50 \text{ dollars} + 10.50 \text{ dollars} = 133 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. Calculate the amount of change Jenny should receive:
   - Jenny pays with 2 twenty dollar bills, which amounts to:
     \[
     2 \times 20 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The amount of change is:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 133 \text{ dollars} = -93 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. Correct the approach since the calculated change is incorrect due to a miscalculation. Let's re-check the total cost calculation:
   - If Jenny paid with 2 twenty dollar bills, she paid $40.
   - The total cost is $122.50 (for printing) + $10.50 (for pens) = $133.
   - The amount of change should be:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 133 \text{ dollars} = -93 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. Realize the mistake in the previous step - it was already calculated correctly as $122.50 + $10.50 = $133.

7. Correct the final calculation:
   - The total cost is $122.50 + $10.50 = $133.
   - The amount of change should be:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 133 \text{ dollars} = -93 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the correct amount of change Jenny should receive is:

To determine the total cost, we first calculate the cost of printing the essay and then the cost of the pens.

The essay has 25 pages and Jenny wants to print 7 copies, so the cost to print everything is calculated as follows:
\[ 25 \text{ pages/essay} \times 7 \text{ essays} \times \$0.10 \text{ per page} = \$17.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pens. Each pen costs \$1.50, and Jenny wants to buy 7 pens:
\[ 7 \text{ pens} \times \$1.50 \text{ per pen} = \$10.50 \]

Adding the cost of printing the essay and the cost of the pens gives:
\[ \$17.50 + \$10.50 = \$28.00 \]

Jenny pays with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is equivalent to \$40.00. The change she should receive after paying for the essay and pens is:
\[ \$40.00 - \$28.00 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny should get in change is \$12.00.

Now, we add the cost of printing and the cost of the pens:
$17.50 + $10.50 = $28.00

Finally, to find out how much change Jenny should get, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:
$20.00 (2 twenty dollar bills) - $28.00 = -$8.00

The negative amount indicates a shortfall, which means Jenny needs an additional $8.00. No change will be given back.

To calculate the total cost of printing the essays and the pens, we first calculate the printing cost:

7 copies * 1 page/copy * $0.10/page = $0.70

Next, we calculate the cost of the pens:

7 pens * $1.50/pen = $10.50

Now we add up the costs:

Printing cost + Pens cost = $0.70 + $10.50 = $11.20

Jenny pays with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is $40. To find out the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

$40 - $11.20 = $28.80

Let's break down the costs:

1. Cost of printing the essay: Jenny needs to print 7 copies, and each page costs $0.10. So the total cost for printing is \(7 \times 25 \times 0.10\).
2. Cost of the pens: Jenny needs 7 pens, each costing $1.50. So the total cost for pens is \(7 \times 1.50\).

Next, we calculate the total cost of both:

- Printing: \(7 \times 25 \times 0.10 = 2.50\) dollars
- Pens: \(7 \times 1.50 = 10.50\) dollars

The total cost is the sum of the printing and pen costs:

- Total cost: \(2.50 + 10.50 = 13\) dollars

Now, let's calculate how much change Jenny should get:

Jenny paid with two twenty dollar bills (which total \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars).

To find out the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

- Change: \(40 - 13 = 27\) dollars

Now, add the printing and pen costs to find the total expenditure: $17.50 (printing) + $10.50 (pens) = $28.
