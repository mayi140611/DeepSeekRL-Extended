###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Joseph and his friends watched two movies in his house. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first. Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?

system
To determine the total time Joseph and his friends spent, we need to calculate the time spent watching the movies and the time spent cooking and then add these together.

First, let's calculate the length of the second movie:
1 hour and 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 2 hours

Now, let's calculate the total time spent cooking and watching the movies:
- Time spent watching the first movie = 1 hour and 30 minutes
- Time spent watching the second movie = 2 hours
- Time spent making popcorn = 10 minutes
- Time spent making fries = 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes

Adding these times together, we get:
First movie: 1.5 hours
Second movie: 2 hours
Popcorn: 10 minutes = 0.1667 hours
Fries: 20 minutes = 0.3333 hours

Total time in minutes: 1.5 + 2 + 0.1667 + 0.3333 = 4 hours

Since the total time is in hours, we don't need to convert it back to minutes.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is 90 minutes.
The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it is 90 + 30 = 120 minutes long.
Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn.
They spent twice as long making fries, so they spent 2 * 10 = 20 minutes making fries.

Total time spent cooking and watching movies is 90 (first movie) + 120 (second movie) + 10 (popcorn) + 20 (fries) = 240 minutes.

To convert to hours, divide the total minutes by 60: 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is 90 minutes. The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it is 90 + 30 = 120 minutes long.

Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries, so they spent 10 + 2*10 = 30 minutes making fries.

The total time spent on cooking is 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on the movies and the cooking.

The total time spent watching movies is 90 + 120 = 210 minutes.

The total time spent cooking is 40 minutes.

So, the total time spent is 210 + 40 = 250 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we have 250/60 = 4.1667 hours.

To find out how long it took Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies, we need to break down the time spent on each activity.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
2. The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it's 1 hour and 60 minutes long.
3. The time spent cooking popcorn is 10 minutes.
4. The time spent cooking fries is twice as long as the time spent cooking popcorn, so it's 20 minutes.

Now let's add up all the time spent:

- Time spent watching movies: 30 minutes (first movie) + 60 minutes (second movie) = 90 minutes.
- Time spent cooking: 10 minutes (popcorn) + 20 minutes (fries) = 30 minutes.

Total time spent: 90 minutes (movies) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes รท 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it took Joseph and his friends 2 hours to cook and watch the movies.

To find out how long it took Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies, we need to do the following calculations:

1. Convert the duration of the first movie to minutes.
2. Calculate the duration of the second movie in minutes.
3. Calculate the total preparation time in minutes.
4. Convert the total preparation time back to hours.

First movie duration: 1 hour 30 minutes = 75 minutes

Second movie duration: 75 minutes + 30 minutes = 105 minutes

Total preparation time: 10 minutes (popcorn) + 2 * 10 minutes (fries) = 30 minutes

Total cooking and watching time in minutes: 75 minutes (first movie) + 105 minutes (second movie) + 30 minutes (preparation) = 210 minutes

To find out how long it took Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Movie:**
   - Duration: 1 hour and 30 minutes
   - Convert to minutes: 1 hour = 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

2. **Second Movie:**
   - Duration: 30 minutes longer than the first movie
   - Duration = 90 minutes + 30 minutes = 120 minutes

3. **Total Movie Time:**
   - Duration of both movies combined = 90 minutes + 120 minutes = 210 minutes

4. **Cooking Time:**
   - Making popcorn: 10 minutes
   - Making fries: twice as long as making popcorn = 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes
   - Total cooking time = 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes

5. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Total movie time + Total cooking time
   - Total time = 210 minutes + 30 minutes = 240 minutes

6. **Convert to hours:**
   - Total time in hours = 240 minutes รท 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

**Conclusion:**
Joseph and his friends took 4 hours to cook and watch the movies.

To find out how long it took Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies, we need to calculate the total time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time spent making popcorn. We know it took 10 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent making fries. It was twice as long as making popcorn, so:
\[ 2 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent watching the movies. The first movie is 90 minutes long (1 hour and 30 minutes), and the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, which makes it:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we sum up all the time spent:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes (first movie)} + 120 \text{ minutes (second movie)} + 10 \text{ minutes (popcorn)} + 20 \text{ minutes (fries)} \]

Converting everything to hours:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ 10 \text{ minutes} = \frac{10}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} \]
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} \]

Adding these up:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} + \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6:
\[ 1.5 = \frac{9}{6}, \quad 2 = \frac{12}{6}, \quad \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}, \quad \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{6} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \frac{9}{6} + \frac{12}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{9 + 12 + 1 + 2}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{24}{6} \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, it took Joseph and his friends 4 hours to cook and watch the movies.

The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it is 1 hour and 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes long.

The total time for both movies is 1 hour 30 minutes + 2 hours 30 minutes = 4 hours.

The time spent cooking popcorn is 10 minutes.

The time spent cooking fries is twice as long as popcorn making, so it is 10 minutes x 2 = 20 minutes.

The total time spent cooking is 10 minutes for popcorn + 20 minutes for fries = 30 minutes.

The total time spent is the time watching movies + time cooking = 4 hours + 30 minutes = 4 hours and 30 minutes.

The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first which is 1 hour and 30 minutes so the second movie is 2 hours 30 minutes or 2.5 hours long.

They spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries which is 20 minutes.

They spent a total of 1 + 2.5 + 10 + 20 = 33 minutes cooking.

33 minutes is 33/60 hours or 0.55 hours.

From this we subtract the time they spent watching movies which is 1 + 2.5 = 3.5 hours.
