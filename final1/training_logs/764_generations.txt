Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses.
2. Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins. Therefore, Governor Hawkins gave $12 / 2 = 6$ commencement addresses.
3. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval. Thus, Governor Sloan gave $12 + 10 = 22$ commencement addresses.

Now, to find the total number of commencement addresses given by all three governors together, we add the number of addresses each gave: $12 + 6 + 22 = 40$. Therefore, the total number of commencement addresses given by the three governors is 40.

Let's start by determining the number of commencement addresses given by each governor.

1. **Governor Sandoval's Commencement Addresses:**
   - Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses.

2. **Governor Hawkins' Commencement Addresses:**
   - Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins.
   - Therefore, Governor Hawkins gave \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) commencement addresses.

3. **Governor Sloan's Commencement Addresses:**
   - Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval.
   - Therefore, Governor Sloan gave \( 12 + 10 = 22 \) commencement addresses.

Now, we sum up the commencement addresses given by all three governors:
\[ 12 \, (\text{Sandoval}) + 6 \, (\text{Hawkins}) + 22 \, (\text{Sloan}) = 40 \]

Thus, the total number of commencement addresses given by Governor Sandoval, Governor Hawkins, and Governor Sloan is 40.

Let's denote the number of commencement addresses given by Governor Sandoval as \( S \), by Governor Hawkins as \( H \), and by Governor Sloan as \( L \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S = 12 \)
2. Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins, so \( S = 2H \).
3. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval, so \( L = S + 10 \).

Using these equations, we can solve for \( H \) and \( L \):

Since \( S = 12 \), we substitute this into the equation \( S = 2H \) to find \( H \):
\[ 12 = 2H \implies H = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Then, using the equation \( L = S + 10 \):
\[ L = 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Now, we can find the total number of commencement addresses given by all three:
\[ S + H + L = 12 + 6 + 22 = 40 \]

Therefore, the three of them gave a total of 40 commencement addresses.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses.
2. Governor Sandoval gave twice as many as Governor Hawkins. Therefore, Governor Hawkins gave \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) commencement addresses.
3. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval. Therefore, Governor Sloan gave \( 12 + 10 = 22 \) commencement addresses.

Now that we know how many commencement addresses each governor gave, we can add them together to find the total number of commencement addresses they gave altogether:

Total addresses = Governor Sandoval's addresses + Governor Hawkins's addresses + Governor Sloan's addresses
Total addresses = 12 + 6 + 22

Therefore, the total number of commencement addresses given by the three governors is \( 12 + 6 + 22 = 40 \).

Let's denote the number of commencement addresses given by Governor Hawkins as \( H \).

According to the information given:
1. Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins, so Governor Sandoval gave \( 2H \) addresses.
2. Governor Sloan gave ten more addresses than Governor Sandoval, so Governor Sloan gave \( 2H + 10 \) addresses.

We know that Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, so we can write:
\[ 2H = 12 \]

Solving for \( H \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[ H = 6 \]

So Governor Hawkins gave 6 commencement addresses.

Now we add all three together:
- Governor Sandoval: 12 addresses
- Governor Hawkins: 6 addresses
- Governor Sloan: \( 12 + 10 = 22 \) addresses

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 6 + 22 = 40 \]

Therefore, Governor Sandoval, Governor Hawkins, and Governor Sloan gave a total of 40 commencement addresses altogether.

Next, we are informed that Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval. Since Governor Sandoval gave 12 addresses, Governor Sloan gave \( 12 + 10 = 22 \) addresses.

To find the total number of commencement addresses given by all three governors, we add their individual addresses:
\[ 12 (Sandoval) + 6 (Hawkins) + 22 (Sloan) = 40 \text{ addresses} \]

Therefore, the total number of commencement addresses given by the three governors is \( 40 \).
