The cost for Julia's parents (2 adults) is 2 * $12 = $24. The cost for her grandmother (1 adult) is 1 * $12 = $12. The cost for her three little sisters (3 children) is 3 * $10 = $30. Adding up all the costs, the total cost for their tickets is $24 + $12 + $30 = $66.

The cost for Julia's mom, dad, and grandma is 3 tickets each at $12 each, so that's 3*3*$12 = $108.
The cost for Julia's three little sisters is 3 tickets each at $10 each, so that's 3*3*$10 = $90.
The total cost for all the tickets is the sum of the costs for adults and children, which is $108 + $90 = $198.

First, we need to calculate the total cost for Julia's parents and grandma. Julia's mom and dad are adults, so they each pay $12 for a ticket. Her grandma is a child, so she pays $10 for a ticket. The total cost for the adults (mom, dad, and grandma) is 2 adults * $12/adult = $24. For the children, the three little sisters are each a child, so they each pay $10 for a ticket. The total cost for the children is 3 children * $10/child = $30. Therefore, the total cost for the tickets is $24 + $30 = $54.

To determine the total cost of the tickets, we need to calculate the cost for the adults and children separately and then add them together.

The cost for the adults (mom, dad, grandma) is:
4 adults * $12/adult = $48

The cost for the children (three little sisters) is:
3 children * $10/child = $30

Now, we add the cost of the adults and children to get the total cost:
$48 + $30 = $78

Therefore, the total cost for their tickets will be $78.

To calculate the total cost for all the tickets, we need to first determine the number of adults and children. There are 2 adults (mom and dad) and 3 children (grandma and three little sisters).

The cost for adults is $12 each, so for 2 adults it would be 2 * $12 = $24.
The cost for children is $10 each, so for 3 children it would be 3 * $10 = $30.

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost for adults and the cost for children: $24 + $30 = $54.

The total cost for her mom and dad (2 adults) will be \(2 \times \$12 = \$24\).

The total cost for her grandma (1 adult) will be \(1 \times \$12 = \$12\).

The total cost for her three little sisters (3 children) will be \(3 \times \$10 = \$30\).

Adding these amounts together, the total cost for their tickets will be \(24 + 12 + 30 = \$66\).

To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost for Julia's family members.

- Julia's mom, dad, and grandma are adults, so their total cost is: 3 adults * $12/adult = $36
- Julia's three little sisters are children, so their total cost is: 3 children * $10/child = $30

Now, we add the money for adults and children to find the total cost: $36 + $30 = $66

To calculate the total cost of the tickets for Julia's family, we first identify the number of adult and children tickets required.

Number of adult tickets = 2 (mom, dad)
Number of children tickets = 3 (grandma, three little sisters)

Then we calculate the total cost for adults and children tickets separately:
Total cost for adults = 2 adults * $12/adult = $24
Total cost for children = 3 children * $10/child = $30

Finally, we add the total costs for adults and children to get the final amount for all their tickets:
Total cost = $24 (adults) + $30 (children) = $54

Let's calculate this step by step:

1. First, we identify the number of adults and children:
   - Adults: mom (1 adult), dad (1 adult), grandma (1 adult) = 3 adults
   - Children: 3 little sisters

2. Calculate the cost for the adults:
   - Each adult ticket costs $12
   - Total for adults = 3 adults * $12/adult = $36

3. Calculate the cost for the children:
   - Each child ticket costs $10
   - Total for children = 3 children * $10/child = $30

4. Finally, add the total costs for adults and children to find the overall cost:
   - Total cost = Cost for adults + Cost for children
   - Total cost = $36 + $30 = $66

Therefore, the total cost for their tickets will be $66.

Let's calculate the cost for each family member and then sum them up:

- Julia's mom, dad, and grandma: Each of these earns $12 for each ticket, so for three members, the total cost is 3 members * $12/member = $36.
- Julia's three little sisters: Each earns $10 for each ticket, so for three members, the total cost is 3 members * $10/member = $30.

Now, let's add the costs together:
- The cost for adults = $36
- The cost for children = $30

Total cost = $36 (adults) + $30 (children) = $66.

To determine the total cost of the tickets, we need to calculate the cost for the adult tickets (mom, dad, and grandma) and the children's tickets (Julia and her three little sisters).

Cost of adult tickets:
1 adult ticket costs $12.
\[ 3 \text{ adults} \times \$12/\text{adult} = \$36 \]

Cost of children's tickets:
1 child ticket costs $10.
\[ 3 \text{ children} \times \$10/\text{child} = \$30 \]

Total cost:
\[ \$36 + \$30 = \$66 \]

Let's break this down step by step:

1. The cost for one adult ticket is $12.
2. Each of Julia's family members (mom, dad, grandma, and three little sisters) will need an adult ticket.
3. Thus, there are 4 adults coming to the show.
4. The total cost for the adult tickets is 4 * $12 = $48.
5. The cost for one children's ticket is $10.
6. Each of Julia's little sisters (three of them) will need a children's ticket.
7. Thus, there are 3 children coming to the show.
8. The total cost for the children's tickets is 3 * $10 = $30.
9. To find the total cost for all the tickets, we add the cost of the adult tickets and the cost of the children's tickets:
   $48 + $30 = $78.

Therefore, the total cost for their tickets will be $78.
