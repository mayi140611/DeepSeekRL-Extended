system
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each batch contains 80 engines, and there are 5 batches.
   Therefore, the total number of engines is \( 80 \times 5 = 400 \) engines.

2. One fourth of the engines are defective. 
   Therefore, the number of defective engines is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \) engines.

3. To find the number of engines that are not defective, we subtract the number of defective engines from the total number of engines.
   Therefore, the number of non-defective engines is \( 400 - 100 = 300 \) engines.

To determine the number of non-defective engines, we first need to calculate the total number of engines and then find out how many of them are defective.

1. Calculate the total number of engines:
   - There are 5 batches of 80 engines each.
   - Total number of engines = \( 5 \times 80 = 400 \).

2. Calculate the number of defective engines:
   - One fourth of the engines are defective.
   - Number of defective engines = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \).

3. Calculate the number of non-defective engines:
   - Number of non-defective engines = Total number of engines - Number of defective engines.
   - Number of non-defective engines = \( 400 - 100 = 300 \).

First, we calculate the total number of engines. Since there are 5 batches of 80 engines each, the total number of engines is 5 * 80 = 400 engines. 

Next, we calculate how many of these engines are defective. If one fourth of the engines are defective, we multiply the total number of engines by one fourth, which is 400 * (1/4) = 100 defective engines.

The number of engines that are not defective can be found by subtracting the defective engines from the total engines, which is 400 - 100 = 300 engines.

Each batch contains 80 engines, and one fourth of them are defective. So, the number of defective engines in each batch is \(1/4 \times 80 = 20\).

Since there are 5 batches, the total number of defective engines is \(20 \times 5 = 100\).

The total number of engines is \(5 \times 80 = 400\).

Therefore, the number of engines that are not defective is \(400 - 100 = 300\).

To determine how many engines are not defective, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of engines.
2. Determine the number of defective engines.
3. Find the number of non-defective engines.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of engines.**

There are 5 batches of 80 engines each. Therefore, the total number of engines is:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of defective engines.**

One fourth of the engines are defective. So, the number of defective engines is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

**Step 3: Find the number of non-defective engines.**

The number of non-defective engines is the total number of engines minus the number of defective engines:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Thus, the number of engines that are not defective is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]

First, we determine the total number of engines. There are 5 batches, each containing 80 engines. Therefore, the total number of engines is \(5 \times 80 = 400\).

Next, we calculate the number of defective engines. If one fourth of the engines are defective, then there are \(\frac{400}{4} = 100\) defective engines.

To find the number of non-defective engines, we subtract the number of defective engines from the total number of engines. Thus, the number of non-defective engines is \(400 - 100 = 300\).

To find out how many engines are not defective, we'll first calculate how many engines are defective, and then subtract that from the total number of engines.

1. **Total number of engines:**
   There are 5 batches of 80 engines each.
   \[
   \text{Total engines} = 5 \times 80 = 400
   \]

2. **Number of defective engines:**
   If one fourth of the engines are defective, then:
   \[
   \text{Defective engines} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]

3. **Number of non-defective engines:**
   The rest of the engines are not defective.
   \[
   \text{Non-defective engines} = \text{Total engines} - \text{Defective engines} = 400 - 100 = 300
   \]

Therefore, there are 300 engines that are not defective.

To find out how many engines are not defective, we first need to determine the total number of engines and then subtract the number of defective engines from this total.

1. The total number of engines can be calculated by multiplying the number of batches by the number of engines in each batch:
   Total engines = 5 * 80

2. One fourth of the engines are defective. So, to find out the number of defective engines:
   Defective engines = (1/4) * Total engines

3. Subtract the number of defective engines from the total number of engines to get the number of engines that are not defective:
   Not defective engines = Total engines - Defective engines

Now let's perform the calculations:
   Total engines = 5 * 80 = 400
   Defective engines = (1/4) * 400 = 100
   Not defective engines = 400 - 100 = 300

So, there are 300 engines that are not defective.

To determine the number of non-defective engines, we can first calculate the total number of engines, then find out how many are defective, and subsequently, find the non-defective ones.

1. The total number of engines is calculated by multiplying the number of batches by the number of engines in each batch:
$$ Total\ Engines = 5 \times 80 = 400 $$

2. Since one fourth of the engines are defective, this means that three fourths of the engines are not defective because:
$$ Not\ defective\ Engines = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} $$
$$ Not\ defective\ Engines = \frac{3}{4} \times 400 = 300 $$

Therefore, 300 engines are not defective.
