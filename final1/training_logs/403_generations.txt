From September 1st to December 31st is 4 months. The 9 horses consume a total of 3 x 30 x 4 = 360 bales a year. The 9 horses would consume a total of 3 x 30 x 4 + 3 x 30 x 12 = 1080 bales for the entire year. In the month of September, the farmer harvested 560 / 5 x 7 = 784 bales of hay. In October, November, and December, the farmer harvested 784 / 3 = 261.33, 261.33, and 261.33 bales of hay. 784 + 261.33 x 3 = 1757.99 bales. The farmer would start feeding hay on November 1st, which means that 1757.99 - 360 - 1080 = 317.99 bales would be left by the end of December.

First, let's calculate the total bales of hay harvested by the farmer per month this year:

Total bales per month last year = 560 bales
Additional bales per acre this year = 560 bales / 5 acres = 112 bales per acre
Total bales per acre this year = 112 bales per acre + 3 bales per horse (since 7 acres = 7 * 112 bales)
Total bales per acre = 848 bales
Total bales per month this year = 848 bales * 9 horses * 30 days = 220,560 bales

Next, we calculate the number of days from September 1st to December 31st:

End of September = 30 days
End of October = 31 days
End of November = 30 days
End of December = 31 days (since December ends with a 31-day month)

Total days from September 1st to December 31st = 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 days

Now we can calculate the total hay harvested by the end of December:

Total bales by end of December = 220,560 bales/ month * (122 days / 30 days in a month) = 220,560 bales * 4.0733 = 897,576.48 bales

Since we can't have a fraction of a bale, let's round down to the nearest whole number: 897,576 bales.

Now let's calculate the bales consumed by the horses over the same period:

Each horse consumes 3 bales of hay a day for 122 days
Total bales consumed by horses = 3 bales * 9 horses * 122 days = 3,294 bales

Finally, we calculate the bales of hay left:

Hay left by the end of December = Total harvested by the end of December - Total consumed by the horses = 897,576 bales - 3,294 bales = 894,282 bales

The farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres of grass per month. This year, he has an additional 7 acres of grass, so the total number of acres of grass he now has is 5 + 7 = 12 acres. If he harvested 560 bales from 5 acres, then he harvested bales from 1 acre as 560/5 = 112 bales per acre. Thus, this year he harvested 12 * 112 = 1344 bales of hay per month. 

We have to consider that a month has roughly 30 days, and the farmer has 9 horses, each consuming 3 bales of hay per day. Therefore, the three month period of September, October, and November will have a total consumption of 270 bales of hay per month because 3 * 9 = 27 bales of hay per horse per day. The consumption from the first day of September to December 31st will account for 31 days * 270 bales of hay per month * 3 months = 24570 bales of hay. 

There are 12 months from September to December, so there will be a total consumption of 12 * 24570 bales of hay.

We have to subtract the total amount of hay consumed from this year's harvest. 1344 bales per month * 12 months = 16128 bales of hay. Therefore, the amount of hay that remains after the consumption is 16128 - 24570 = -8442 bales of hay.

To determine how many bales of hay the farmer would have left by the end of December, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bales of hay harvested per acre of grass this year.
2. Determine the total number of bales of hay harvested this year from the additional 7 acres.
3. Calculate the total number of bales of hay harvested this year.
4. Determine how many bales of hay the horses will consume by the end of December.
5. Subtract the bales consumed by the horses from the total harvested to find the bales left.

First, calculate the number of bales of hay harvested per acre of grass this year:
\[ \text{Bales per acre} = \frac{560 \text{ bales}}{5 \text{ acres}} = 112 \text{ bales per acre} \]

Next, calculate the total number of bales of hay harvested from the additional 7 acres:
\[ \text{Bales from additional 7 acres} = 112 \text{ bales per acre} \times 7 \text{ acres} = 784 \text{ bales} \]

Now, calculate the total number of bales of hay harvested this year from all 12 acres:
\[ \text{Total bales harvested} = 560 \text{ bales} \times 12 \text{ months} + 784 \text{ bales} \]
\[ \text{Total bales harvested} = 6720 + 784 = 7504 \text{ bales} \]

Next, determine the total number of bales of hay consumed by the horses by the end of December. Each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day, and there are 9 horses:
\[ \text{Bales consumed per day} = 3 \text{ bales/horse/day} \times 9 \text{ horses} = 27 \text{ bales/day} \]
\[ \text{Bales consumed by end of December} = 27 \text{ bales/day} \times \frac{60}{30} \text{ days} = 27 \text{ bales} \]

Finally, subtract the bales consumed by the horses from the total harvested:
\[ \text{Bales left} = 7504 \text{ bales} - 27 \text{ bales} = 7477 \text{ bales} \]

The farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres of grass per month last year, so he consumed 560/5 = 112 bales per month.
This year, he has planted an additional 7 acres of grass, so the total area of grass is now 5 + 7 = 12 acres.
To calculate the total hay yield this year, we need to multiply the total area of grass (12 acres) by the number of bales of hay per acre (560 bales per 5 acres) = 12 * 560 = 6720 bales of hay.
This means the farmer would have 6720 - 112 = 6608 bales of hay left by the end of September.
From October to December, the farmer will feed the 9 horses, consuming 3 bales of hay each day. So they will consume 9 * 3 = 27 bales of hay per day.
To calculate the total hay consumed by the horses from the first day of September to the end of December, we need to calculate the number of days in each of those months.
September has 30 days, October has 31 days, and December has 31 days.
Thus, the total number of days from September to the end of December is 30 + 31 + 31 = 92 days.
As such, the total number of bales of hay consumed by the horses from the beginning of September to the end of December is 27 * 92 = 2484.
Therefore, the farmer would have 6608 - 2484 = 4124 bales of hay left by the end of December.

To determine how many bales of hay the farmer would have left by the end of December, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of hay harvested in September from the additional 7 acres of grass.
2. Determine the total amount of hay harvested until the end of December, including the hay harvested from the additional 7 acres.
3. Calculate the total amount of hay consumed by the horses from September 1 to the end of December.
4. Subtract the hay consumed by the horses from the total hay harvested.

Step 1: Calculate the hay harvested from the additional 7 acres.

Hay harvested per day from additional 7 acres per month = 7 acres * 560 bales/acre/month = 3920 bales/month.

Hay harvested from September to December = 3920 bales/month * 4 months = 15680 bales.

Step 2: Total hay harvested by the end of December.

Total hay harvested = Hay from additional 7 acres + Existing hay from 5 acres * 12 months
Total hay harvested = 15680 bales + (5 acres * 12 months * 560 bales/acre/month)
Total hay harvested = 15680 bales + 336000 bales
Total hay harvested = 351680 bales

Step 3: Calculate the hay consumed by the horses from September 1 to December 31.

Horses = 9
Horses per day = 9 * 3 bales/horse/day = 27 bales/horse/day.
Total horses for 1 year = 9 * 12 months = 108 days.

Daily consumption by horses = 27 bales of hay/day.

Hay consumption by horses in 1 year = 27 bales/horse/day * 108 days/1 year = 2916 bales/1 year.

Step 4: Subtract the hay consumed by horses from the total hay harvested.

Hay left by the end of December = Total hay harvested - Hay consumed by horses
Hay left by the end of December = 351680 bales - 2916 bales
Hay left by the end of December = 348764 bales

To determine how many bales of hay the farmer has left by the end of December, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bales of hay harvested this year:**
   - This year, the farmer has 7 additional acres of grass.
   - Therefore, the total number of acres of grass is \(5 + 7 = 12\) acres.
   - Since the farmer harvested 560 bales of hay per month from 5 acres, the monthly production is:
     \[
     \text{Bales per acre per month} = \frac{560 \text{ bales}}{5 \text{ acres}} = 112 \text{ bales per acre per month}
     \]
   - Thus, the total number of bales of hay harvested per month is:
     \[
     112 \text{ bales per acre per month} \times 12 \text{ acres} = 1344 \text{ bales per month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of bales of hay harvested this year:**
   - The farmer keeps the hay for 4 months in total (September, October, November, December).
   - Therefore, the total number of bales of hay harvested over 4 months is:
     \[
     1344 \text{ bales per month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 5376 \text{ bales}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bales of hay consumed by the horses by the end of December:**
   - Each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day.
   - There are 9 horses, so the total consumption per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales per horse per day} = 27 \text{ bales per day}
     \]
   - By the end of December (31 days), the total consumption is:
     \[
     27 \text{ bales per day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 837 \text{ bales}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of bales of hay left after feeding the horses:**
   - Subtract the total consumption from the total harvested bales:
     \[
     5376 \text{ bales} - 837 \text{ bales} = 4539 \text{ bales}
     \]

Therefore, the farmer has **4539 bales of hay left by the end of December**.

To determine the number of bales of hay the farmer would have left by the end of December, we first need to calculate the amount of hay harvested this year.

Last year, the farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres of grass per month. This year, he planted an additional 7 acres of grass, making a total of 5 + 7 = 12 acres of grass. Since the amount of hay harvested per acre is the same, the farmer harvested \(560 \times 12 / 5 = 1344\) bales of hay annually this year.

To find out how much hay the farmer would consume by the end of December, we need to consider that the farmer started feeding the horses on September 1st and stopped feeding them on December 31st. The period from September 1st to December 31st is approximately 5 months, assuming the consumption pattern is the same each month.

Given that each horse consumes 3 bales of hay a day, and assuming an average of 30 days in a month, the consumption is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) bales of hay per horse per month. With 9 horses, the total consumption is \(90 \times 9 = 810\) bales of hay per month.

To find out how much hay the farmer would have left in 5 months, we calculate the total consumption and subtract it from the total amount of hay harvested. Since 2021 is a leap year and has 366 days, we can calculate the periods more precisely:
- From September 1st to September 30th: 30 days
- From October 1st to December 31st: 91 days (since we round the additional day to the nearest month)

So, the total consumption in 5 months is \(810 \times 5 = 4050\) bales of hay for the 9 horses.

The amount of hay the farmer would have left is the total hay harvested this year minus the total consumption over 5 months:
\[ 1344 - 4050 = -2706 \]

Since the negative value indicates that the farmer would consume more hay than the amount harvested, the farmer would not have any hay left by the end of December.

To determine how many bales of hay the farmer would have left by the end of December if he begins feeding the horses this year's hay starting September, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of hay harvested this year.
2. Determine the total number of bales of hay available for feeding.
3. Calculate the total number of bales each horse consumes.
4. Determine the total number of days from September to December.
5. Calculate the total amount of hay consumed by the horses over the period from September to December.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of hay harvested this year.**

This year, the farmer has 5 acres of grass and he planted an additional 7 acres, so the total acreage is:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \text{ acres} \]

The hay harvested each month is:
\[ \frac{560 \text{ bales/month}}{12 \text{ months}} = \frac{560}{12} \approx 46.67 \text{ bales/month} \]

So, the total amount of hay harvested this year is:
\[ 46.67 \text{ bales/month} \times 11 \text{ months} = 513.37 \text{ bales} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of bales of hay available for feeding.**

The farmer has 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay a day. Therefore, the total amount of hay consumed by the horses in a month is:
\[ 9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales/horse/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 810 \text{ bales/month} \]

So, the total amount of hay consumed by the horses in a year is:
\[ 810 \text{ bales/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 9720 \text{ bales} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total number of days from September to December.**

September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So the total number of days is:
\[ 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 \text{ days} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of hay consumed by the horses over the period from September to December.**

Since each horse consumes 3 bales of hay a day, the total amount of hay consumed by all the horses in 122 days is:
\[ 9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales/horse/day} \times 122 \text{ days} = 3324 \text{ bales} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of hay left by the farmer by the end of December.**

The farmer starts feeding the horses the year's hay in September, so the hay harvested this year will be used up by the end of December. The total amount of hay harvested this year is 513.37 bales, and the total amount of hay consumed by the horses is 3324 bales. Since the farmer only harvested 513.37 bales, which is less than the 3324 bales required, the farmer would not have enough hay to feed the horses for all 122 days.

To determine how many bales of hay the farmer will have left by the end of December, we need to calculate the total amount of hay harvested this year and compare it to the hay consumed by the horses until December.

First, let's calculate the total amount of hay harvested this year. Last year, the farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres of grass per month. This year, the farmer has an additional 7 acres of grass, so the total number of acres is now 12 (5 + 7). Therefore, the total amount of hay harvested this year is:

\[ 560 \text{ bales/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 6720 \text{ bales/year} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of hay consumed by the horses from September 1 to December 31. The farmer has 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay a day. The total consumption per day for all horses is:

\[ 9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales/horse/day} = 27 \text{ bales/day} \]

From September 1 to December 31, there are four months (September, October, November, December). Therefore, the total consumption from September 1 to December 31 is:

\[ 27 \text{ bales/day} \times 4 \text{ months} = 108 \text{ bales} \]

Now, we subtract the total consumption from the total hay harvested:

\[ 6720 \text{ bales/year} - 108 \text{ bales} = 6612 \text{ bales/year} \]

So, by the end of December, the farmer would have left:

To determine how many bales of hay the farmer has left by the end of December, we first need to calculate the total amount of hay harvested this year.

This year, the farmer has 5 acres + 7 acres = 12 acres of grass. Last year, he harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres, so this year he will harvest bales of hay from 12 acres. Therefore, the total amount of hay harvested this year is 12 acres * 560 bales/acre = 6720 bales.

Each horse consumes 3 bales of hay a day, and there are 9 horses. So, the total consumption of hay per day is 3 bales/horse/day * 9 horses = 27 bales/day.

Now we calculate the number of days from September 1st to December 31st. From September 1st to September 30th is 30 days, then October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 31 days, which totals 121 days.

So, the total amount of hay consumed by the horses by the end of December is 27 bales/day * 121 days = 3267 bales.

In the previous year, the hay farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres of grass per month. This year, he has grown an additional 7 acres of grass, making the total acres available 5 + 7 = 12 acres. The hay farmer also owns 9 horses that consume 3 bales of hay per day. Therefore, the total consumption of hay by the horses is 9 horses * 3 bales/day = 27 bales/day.

Now, let's calculate how much hay the farmer will have harvested by the end of December after the hay storage time lapse.

In the year, there are 365 days (or 52 weeks and 1 day). Since the hay storage time lapse starts the first day of September, the hay storage duration ends by December 31st. Therefore, the farmer harvests hay for 90 days (52 weeks + 1 day) and feeds hay for 27 days (90 - 63 = 27).

With an additional 7 acres (840 bales) of grass per month this year, the hay farmer can sustain the 27-horses feeding program and have extra hay left at the end of the year.

Considering this, the farmer will have harvested bales = 560 bales/month * 12 months = 6720 bales. Since the feed duration is 27 days, the total hay consumed would be 9 horses * 3 bales/day * 27 days = 729 bales. Hence, the farmer would have 6720 bales - 729 bales = 5991 bales of hay left.

To determine how many bales of hay the farmer would have left by the end of December after starting to feed his horses with this year's hay starting on September 1st, we need to calculate the total hay available from last year and this year, as well as the daily hay consumption of the horses.

Last year, the farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres of grass per month. Therefore, the total amount of hay available last year is:
\[ 560 \text{ bales/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6720 \text{ bales} \]

This year, the farmer planted an additional 7 acres of grass. The total amount of grass this year is:
\[ 5 \text{ acres/yr} + 7 \text{ acres/yr} = 12 \text{ acres/yr} \]

Assuming the hay is harvested continuously and the hay per acre per month remains the same, the number of bales harvested per month this year is:
\[ \frac{560 \text{ bales}}{12 \text{ months}} \times 12 \text{ months} = 560 \text{ bales/month} \]

So, the total amount of hay available this year is:
\[ 560 \text{ bales/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6720 \text{ bales} \]

Adding the total from last year and this year:
\[ 6720 \text{ bales} + 6720 \text{ bales} = 13440 \text{ bales} \]

The farmer has 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day. There are 120 days from September 1st to December 31st. Therefore, the total amount of hay consumed by the horses over this period is:
\[ 9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales/horse/day} \times 120 \text{ days} = 3240 \text{ bales} \]

Finally, the amount of hay left by the end of December is:

- The farmer harvested 560 bales of hay per month, so for 12 months, he harvested \( 560 \times 12 = 6720 \) bales of hay.

Next, we calculate the total hay consumed by the horses from September to December:

- Each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day.
- There are 9 horses, so each horse consumes \( 3 \) bales/day.
- The total consumption per day is \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \) bales/day.
- From September to December, there are 4 months.

The total hay consumed by the horses over these 4 months is:
\[ 27 \times 4 = 108 \, \text{bales} \]

To find out how many bales are left by the end of December, we subtract the consumption from the total harvest:

\[ 6720 - 108 = 6612 \, \text{bales} \]

Therefore, by the end of December, the farmer would have 6612 bales of hay left.

To determine the number of bales of hay left by the end of December, we first need to calculate the amount of hay harvested this year.

1. Calculate the total amount of hay harvested per month this year:
\[ \text{Hay harvested per month} = 560 \text{ bales} \]

2. Calculate the total amount of hay harvested over the months up to September:
\[ \text{Hay harvested from September} = 560 \times 3 = 1680 \text{ bales} \]

3. Calculate the total amount of hay harvested from the additional 7 acres planted:
\[ \text{Hay harvested from 7 acres} = 560 \times (7 \text{ acres} \times 3 \text{ days}) = 560 \times 21 = 11760 \text{ bales} \]

4. Calculate the total amount of hay harvested this year:
\[ \text{Total hay harvested} = 1680 + 11760 = 13440 \text{ bales} \]

5. Calculate the total hay consumed by the horses:
\[ \text{Total hay consumed} = 9 \times 3 \times 31 = 837 \text{ bales} \]
(The year has 365 days, so 31 days have passed from September to December.)

6. Calculate the amount of hay left by the end of December:
\[ \text{Hay left by the end of December} = 13440 - 837 = 12603 \text{ bales} \]
