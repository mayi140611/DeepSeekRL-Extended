#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Catriona has 8 + 4 = 12 angelfish.
Catriona has 12 x 2 = 24 guppies.
Thus, Catriona has 8 + 12 + 24 = 44 fish in her aquarium.

Catriona has 8 goldfish. She has 4 more angelfish than goldfish, so she has \(8 + 4 = 12\) angelfish. She has twice as many guppies as angelfish, so she has \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guppies. Adding all together, Catriona has \(8 + 12 + 24 = 44\) fish in her aquarium.

First, we know Catriona has 8 goldfish. She has 4 more angelfish than goldfish, so she has \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) angelfish. Next, she has twice as many guppies as angelfish, so she has \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) guppies. To find the total number of fish, we add the number of goldfish, angelfish, and guppies together: \( 8 + 12 + 24 = 44 \).

To find out how many fish Catriona has in her aquarium, let's calculate the number of each type of fish she has.

First, we know Catriona has 8 goldfish.

Next, she has 4 more angelfish than goldfish, so we can calculate the number of angelfish as follows:

Angelfish = Goldfish + 4
Angelfish = 8 + 4
Angelfish = 12

Now, she has twice as many guppies as angelfish, so we calculate the number of guppies as:

Guppies = 2 * Angelfish
Guppies = 2 * 12
Guppies = 24

To find the total number of fish, we add up all the fish:

Total fish = Goldfish + Angelfish + Guppies
Total fish = 8 + 12 + 24
Total fish = 44

Therefore, Catriona has 44 fish in her aquarium.

To find out how many fish Catriona has in her aquarium, we need to calculate the total number of each type of fish she has and then add them together.

1. Cats has 8 goldfish.
2. Angelfish: She has 8 goldfish + 4 = 12 angelfish (since she has 4 more angelfish than goldfish).
3. Guppies: She has 12 angelfish × 2 = 24 guppies (since she has twice as many guppies as angelfish).

Now, we add up all the fish:

8 goldfish + 12 angelfish + 24 guppies = 44 fish in total.

To find the total number of fish, we first need to determine the number of each type of fish:

- Catriona has 8 goldfish.
- She has 4 more angelfish than goldfish, so she has \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) angelfish.
- She has twice as many guppies as angelfish, so she has \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) guppies.

Now, to find the total number of fish, we add the numbers of each type:

\[ 8 (goldfish) + 12 (angelfish) + 24 (guppies) = 44 \]

Therefore, Catriona has 44 fish in her aquarium.

To find the total number of fish in Catriona's aquarium, we need to determine the number of each type of fish and then sum them up. We know the following:

1. Catriona has 8 goldfish.
2. She has 4 more angelfish than goldfish.
3. She has twice as many guppies as angelfish.

Let's calculate the number of angelfish and guppies:

- Angelfish: Catriona has 8 goldfish + 4 = 12 angelfish.
- Guppies: Catriona has twice as many guppies as angelfish, so she has 2 * 12 = 24 guppies.

Now, we sum the number of each type of fish:
- Goldfish: 8
- Angelfish: 12
- Guppies: 24

Total number of fish = 8 (goldfish) + 12 (angelfish) + 24 (guppies) = 44 fish.

To find out how many fish Catriona has in her aquarium, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish and then add them together.

1. **Goldfish**: We are told that Catriona has 8 goldfish.
   \[
   \text{Number of goldfish} = 8
   \]

2. **Angelfish**: Catriona has 4 more angelfish than goldfish. Since we know she has 8 goldfish, we can calculate the number of angelfish as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of angelfish} = 8 + 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Guppies**: Catriona has twice as many guppies as angelfish. Since we know she has 12 angelfish, we can calculate the number of guppies as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of guppies} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

4. **Total number of fish**: Now, we can add the number of each type of fish to find the total number of fish in her aquarium:
   \[
   \text{Total number of fish} = \text{Number of goldfish} + \text{Number of angelfish} + \text{Number of guppies} = 8 + 12 + 24 = 44
   \]

Therefore, Catriona has 44 fish in her aquarium.

First, we determine the number of angelfish, which is given as 4 more than the number of goldfish. There are 8 goldfish, so the number of angelfish is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, we find the number of guppies, which are twice the number of angelfish. Since there are 12 angelfish, the number of guppies is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Now, we add up all the fish in the aquarium:
\[ 8 \text{ (goldfish)} + 12 \text{ (angelfish)} + 24 \text{ (guppies)} = 44 \]

First, let's find out how many angelfish Catriona has. Since she has 4 more angelfish than goldfish, we add 4 to the number of goldfish:

Angelfish = Goldfish + 4
Angelfish = 8 + 4
Angelfish = 12

Next, we'll calculate the number of guppies, knowing that she has twice as many guppies as angelfish:

Guppies = 2 × Angelfish
Guppies = 2 × 12
Guppies = 24

Now, we can add up all the fish to find the total number in the aquarium:

Total fish = Goldfish + Angelfish + Guppies
Total fish = 8 + 12 + 24
Total fish = 44

Therefore, Catriona has 44 fish in her aquarium.
