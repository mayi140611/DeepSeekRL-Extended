###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Nellie can eat 12 sourball candies before crying. Jacob can only manage half of that number of candies, and Lana can only do three fewer than Jacob. They had a bucket of 30 candies, and all of them ate until they cried. If they divide the remaining candies in the bucket equally, how many sourball candies will they each get?

Jacob can eat 12/2 = 6 candies before crying. Lana can eat 6 - 3 = 3 candies. In total, Nellie, Jacob, and Lana ate 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 candies. So, there are 30 - 21 = 9 candies remaining. If they divide these equally, they would each get their share of 9 / 3 = 3 candies.

To find out how many sourball candies they will each get, we need to first calculate the total number of candies they can eat before crying.

1. Nellie can eat 12 candies.
2. Jacob can only manage half of Nellie's candies, which is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) candies.
3. Lana can do three fewer than Jacob, so she eats \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) candies.

Total candies they can eat before crying:
\[ 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 \]

So, they will have \( 30 - 21 = 9 \) candies left after they all cry.

Since they divide the remaining candies equally, each will get:
\[ \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

Therefore, each will get 3 sourball candies.

Nellie can eat 12 candies.
Jacob can eat half of what Nellie can eat, so Jacob can eat \(12 / 2 = 6\) candies.
Lana can eat three fewer than Jacob, so Lana can eat \(6 - 3 = 3\) candies.
Together, they can eat \(12 + 6 + 3 = 21\) candies.

There are 30 candies in the bucket, and they eat \(21\), so there will be \(30 - 21 = 9\) candies left.
If they divide these 9 candies equally among the three, each will get \(9 / 3 = 3\) candies.

The final answer is 3.

To determine how many sourball candies each person will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many candies each person can eat before crying.
2. Calculate the total number of candies they ate until they cried.
3. Subtract the total number of candies they ate from the original number of candies to find out how many are left.
4. Divide the remaining candies equally.

Let's start with step 1. Nellie can eat 12 candies. Jacob can only manage half of that number, which is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) candies. Lana can do three fewer than Jacob, so she can eat \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) candies. 

Next, in step 2, we add up the total number of candies they ate:

\[ 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 \]

Now, in step 3, we subtract the total number of candies they ate from the original number of candies to find out how many are left:

\[ 30 - 21 = 9 \]

Finally, in step 4, we divide the remaining candies equally among them:

\[ \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

Therefore, they each get 3 sourball candies.

<p>So the answer is 3.</p>

Nellie can eat 12 candies. Jacob can eat half of that number, which is 6 candies. Lana can eat three fewer than Jacob, which is 3 candies. So together, they ate a total of 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 candies. There were 30 candies in total, so 30 - 21 = 9 candies are left. These 9 candies are divided equally among the 3 people, so 9 / 3 = 3 candies per person.

Jacob can only manage half of that, so Jacob can eat \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) candies.

They started with 30 candies, so the number of candies remaining in the bucket is:

Nellie can eat 12 sourball candies before crying.

Jacob can eat half of what Nellie can eat, so:

There are 30 candies in the bucket initially. After they have eaten, the number of candies remaining is:
\[ \text{Remaining candies} = 30 - 21 = 9 \]

Since they will divide the remaining 9 candies equally among the three of them, the number of candies each person gets is:

Let's calculate the number of candies each person can eat:

- Nellie can eat 12 candies.
- Jacob can eat half of Nellie's amount, so he can eat \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) candies.
- Lana can eat three fewer than Jacob, so she can eat \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) candies.

Now, let's find the total number of candies they eat:

\( 12 \) (Nellie) + \( 6 \) (Jacob) + \( 3 \) (Lana) = \( 21 \) candies

They had a bucket of 30 candies, so the remaining number of candies is:

\( 30 \) - \( 21 \) = \( 9 \) candies

If they divide the remaining candies equally, each person will get:

\( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) candies

So, each of them will get 3 sourball candies if the candies are divided equally after they've cried.

To determine how many sourball candies each person will get, we need to calculate the total number of sourball candies they ate and then find out how many are left to divide.

1. **Calculate the number of candies Nellie ate:**
   Nellie can eat 12 sourball candies before crying.
   \[
   Nellie's \ candies = 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of candies Jacob ate:**
   Jacob can only manage half of the number of candies Nellie can eat.
   \[
   Jacob's \ candies = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of candies Lana ate:**
   Lana can eat three fewer candies than Jacob.
   \[
   Lana's \ candies = 6 - 3 = 3
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of candies eaten by Nellie, Jacob, and Lana:**
   \[
   Total \ candies \ eaten = Nellie's \ candies + Jacob's \ candies + Lana's \ candies = 12 + 6 + 3 = 21
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining number of candies in the bucket:**
   The bucket originally had 30 candies.
   \[
   Remaining \ candies = 30 - Total \ candies \ eaten = 30 - 21 = 9
   \]

6. **Divide the remaining candies equally among Nellie, Jacob, and Lana:**
   There are 3 people sharing the remaining candies.
   \[
   Candies \ per \ person = \frac{Remaining \ candies}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

So, each person will get 3 sourball candies.
