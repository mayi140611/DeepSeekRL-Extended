To find out how much money Monika spent throughout her day, we need to add up the costs of each transaction.

First, we know that Monika spent $250 at the mall.

Next, she spent $24 x 3 for the 3 movies, which equals $72.

Then, she spent 20 bags of beans at $1.25 each. To find out how much she spent on the beans, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 20 x $1.25 = $25.

Now, we add up all the costs: $250 + $72 + $25 = $347.

Therefore, Monika spent $347 throughout her day.

To find out how much money Monika spent throughout her day, we need to add up the amounts spent at each location. 

First, at the mall, she spent $250.
Then, at the movies, she watched 3 movies, each costing $24. So the total spent at the movies is \(3 \times 24 = $72\).
At the farmer's market, she bought 20 bags of beans at $1.25 per bag, so the total spent at the farmer's market is \(20 \times 1.25 = $25\).

Now, we add these amounts together: \(250 + 72 + 25 = $347\).

Therefore, Monika spent a total of $347 throughout her day.

To find out how much money Monika spent throughout her day, we need to add up the money spent at each location.

1. At the mall, Monika spent $250.
2. At the movies, she watched 3 movies, each costing $24. So, the total cost for the movies is 3 * $24 = $72.
3. At the farmer's market, she bought 20 bags of beans at $1.25 per bag. So, the total cost is 20 * $1.25 = $25.

Now we add up all the cash she spent:

$250 (mall) + $72 (movies) + $25 (market) = $347

Therefore, Monika spent a total of $347 throughout her day.

To determine how much money Monika spent throughout her day, we need to calculate the total amount spent at each location and then sum them up.

1. **Mall Spending:**
   Monika spent $250 at the mall.

2. **Movies Spending:**
   Monika watched 3 movies that each cost $24. The total cost for the movies is calculated as follows:
   \[
   3 \times 24 = 72
   \]
   So, she spent $72 on the movies.

3. **Farmer's Market Spending:**
   Monika bought 20 bags of beans at $1.25 per bag. The total cost for the beans is calculated as follows:
   \[
   20 \times 1.25 = 25
   \]
   So, she spent $25 at the farmer's market.

Now, we sum up all the expenses:
\[
250 + 72 + 25 = 347
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Monika spent throughout her day is:
\[
347
\]

To determine how much money Monika spent throughout her day, we need to calculate the total cost of each activity and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the cost of the mall visit:
\[ \text{Cost at the mall} = \$250 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the movies:
Monika watched 3 movies, and each movie cost $24.
\[ \text{Cost of movies} = 3 \times \$24 = \$72 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the farmer's market visit:
Monika bought 20 bags of beans, and each bag cost $1.25.
\[ \text{Cost at the farmer's market} = 20 \times \$1.25 = \$25 \]

Now, we sum up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$250 + \$72 + \$25 = \$347 \]

Therefore, Monika spent a total of $347 throughout her day.
