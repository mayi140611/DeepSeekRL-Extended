#### ANS ####

175
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's calculate the number of books each person has:

1. Harry has 50 books.
2. Flora has twice as many books as Harry, so she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) books.
3. Gary has half the books that Harry has, so he has \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) books.

Now, we add up the number of books they all have together:

- Harry's books: 50
- Flora's books: 100
- Gary's books: 25

Total number of books = \(50 + 100 + 25 = 175\).

system
Reasoning:

First, let's determine how many books Flora has. Since Flora has twice as many books as Harry, we calculate:
Flora's books = 2 * Harry's books
Flora's books = 2 * 50
Flora's books = 100

Next, let's find out how many books Gary has. Gary has half the books that Harry has:
Gary's books = 1/2 * Harry's books
Gary's books = 1/2 * 50
Gary's books = 25

To find the total number of books the three of them own together, we add the number of books each person has:
Total books = Harry's books + Flora's books + Gary's books
Total books = 50 + 100 + 25

Now, let's calculate the total:
Total books = 50 + 100 + 25
Total books = 175

Therefore, the three of them own 175 books together.

To find out how many books the three of them own together, let's follow these steps:

1. Harry has 50 books.
2. Flora has twice as many books as Harry, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) books.
3. Gary has half the books Harry has, which is \(\frac{50}{2} = 25\) books.

Now, let's add up the books owned by Harry, Flora, and Gary:

\(50 + 100 + 25 = 175\)

So, the total number of books owned by Harry, Flora, and Gary together is 175.

2. Flora has twice as many books as Harry, so Flora has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) books.
3. Gary has half the number of books Harry has, so Gary has \(50 \div 2 = 25\) books.

To find out how many books they own together, we add the number of books each person has:

\[ 50 (Harry's books) + 100 (Flora's books) + 25 (Gary's books) = 175 \]

First, we need to determine how many books Flora has. Since Flora has twice as many books as Harry, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Flora's books} = 2 \times \text{Harry's books} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we find out how many books Gary has. Since Gary has half the books Harry has, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Gary's books} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Harry's books} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

Now, to find out the total number of books owned by Harry, Flora, and Gary together, we add their individual book counts:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Harry's books} + \text{Flora's books} + \text{Gary's books} \]
\[ = 50 + 100 + 25 \]
\[ = 175 \]

Therefore, the three of them own a total of 175 books together.

First, we need to determine how many books Flora and Gary have based on the information given. Flora has twice as many books as Harry, and Harry has 50 books. So, Flora has \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) books. 

Gary has half the books Harry has, which means Gary has \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) books.

Now we can sum up all the books that Harry, Flora, and Gary have together:
- Harry: 50 books
- Flora: 100 books
- Gary: 25 books

Adding these numbers together:
\[
50 + 100 + 25 = 175

So, the total number of books that Harry, Flora, and Gary own together is 175.

First, we calculate the number of books Flora has. Since Flora has twice as many books as Harry, we multiply the number of books Harry has by 2:

Flora's books = 50 books * 2 = 100 books

Next, we calculate the number of books Gary has. Gary has half the number of books Harry has, so:

Gary's books = 50 books / 2 = 25 books

Now, to find the total number of books the three of them own together, we add the number of books each one has:

Total books = Harry's books + Flora's books + Gary's books
Total books = 50 + 100 + 25
Total books = 175 books

Therefore, the three of them own 175 books together.
