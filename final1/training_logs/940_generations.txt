Kylie initially has 5 daisies. Her sister gives her 9 more daisies, so she now has a total of 5 + 9 = 14 daisies. Kylie then gives half of her daisies to her mother, which means she gives away 14 / 2 = 7 daisies. Therefore, Kylie has 14 - 7 = 7 daisies left.

First, we need to determine the total number of daisies Kylie has before she gives any away. Kylie initially has 5 daisies, and her sister gives her another 9 daisies. So, the total number of daisies Kylie has is:
\[ 5 + 9 = 14 \]

Next, Kylie gives half of her daisies to her mother. Half of 14 daisies is:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Kylie gives 7 daisies to her mother, and she is left with:
\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of daisies Kylie has left is 7.

First, we calculate the total number of daisies Kylie has after her sister gave her more. Kylie initially has 5 daisies and her sister adds 9 more. So, the total number of daisies Kylie has before giving any away is:
\[ 5 + 9 = 14 \]

Next, Kylie gives half of her daisies to her mother. Half of 14 is:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

Subtracting the 7 daisies given to her mother from the initial total, we get:
\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \]

So, Kylie has 7 daisies left.

To determine how many daisies Kylie has left, we can break the problem down step by step:

1. Kylie starts with 5 daisies.
2. Her sister gives her an additional 9 daisies.
   - Total daisies after receiving from sister: \( 5 + 9 = 14 \).
3. Kylie gives half of her total daisies to her mother.
   - Half of 14 daisies: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \).
   - Daisies left after giving to mother: \( 14 - 7 = 7 \).

Therefore, Kylie has 7 daisies left.
