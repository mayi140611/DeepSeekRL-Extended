system
Jeanette starts out juggling 3 objects and each week she can juggle 2 more objects than the week before. This means she can juggle 3+2 = 5 objects in the first week. She can juggle 5+2 = 7 objects in the second week. She can juggle 7+2 = 9 objects in the third week. She can juggle 9+2 = 11 objects in the fourth week. She can juggle 11+2 = 13 objects in the fifth week.

Therefore, the answer is 13.

system
Jeanette starts out juggling 3 objects and practices for 5 weeks. Each week she can juggle 2 more objects than the week before.

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to find out how many objects she can juggle after 5 weeks.

\( n = 5 \) (the number of weeks)
\( a_1 = 3 \) (the first term)
\( d = 2 \) (the common difference, since she can juggle 2 more objects each week)

The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \)

So, after 5 weeks, the last term \( a_n \) that she can juggle is:
\( a_n = 3 + (5 - 1) * 2 = 3 + 10 = 13 \)

Now, the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} * (a_1 + a_n) \)

So, the total number of objects she can juggle after 5 weeks is:
\( S_5 = \frac{5}{2} * (3 + 13) = \frac{5}{2} * 16 = 40 \).

Therefore, Jeanette can juggle 40 objects after 5 weeks.

Jeanette starts out juggling 3 objects and each week she increases her ability to juggle by 2 objects. So we can calculate the number of objects she can juggle each week as follows:

Week 1: 3 objects
Week 2: 3 + 2 = 5 objects
Week 3: 5 + 2 = 7 objects
Week 4: 7 + 2 = 9 objects
Week 5: 9 + 2 = 11 objects

Therefore, after practicing for 5 weeks, Jeanette can juggle 11 objects.

Initially, Jeanette can juggle 3 objects. Each week, she increases her ability by 2 objects. 

To find out how many objects she can juggle after 5 weeks, we start with her initial ability:

**Week 1:** 3 objects
**Week 2:** 3 + 2 = 5 objects
**Week 3:** 5 + 2 = 7 objects
**Week 4:** 7 + 2 = 9 objects
**Week 5:** 9 + 2 = 11 objects

So, after 5 weeks, Jeanette can juggle **11 objects.**

1st week: 3 objects
2nd week: 3 + 2 = 5 objects
3rd week: 3 + 4 = 7 objects
4th week: 3 + 6 = 9 objects
5th week: 3 + 8 = 11 objects

Therefore, by the end of the 5th week, Jeanette would be able to juggle 11 objects.
