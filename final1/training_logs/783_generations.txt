###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Eden, Mary and Iris gather sand to fill their sandbox. Eden carried 4 buckets of sand. Mary carried 3 more buckets of sand than Eden. Iris carried 1 less bucket of sand than Mary. If each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand, how many pounds of sand did they collect in total?

<reasoning>
Eden carried 4 buckets, so she carried a total of 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of sand.
Mary carried 3 more buckets than Eden, so she carried 4 + 3 = 7 buckets, resulting in 7 * 2 = 14 pounds of sand.
Iris carried 1 less bucket than Mary, so she carried 7 - 1 = 6 buckets, resulting in 6 * 2 = 12 pounds of sand.

The total amount of sand they collected is 8 + 14 + 12 = 34 pounds.

First, we determine how many buckets each person carried. Eden carried 4 buckets. Mary carried 3 more buckets than Eden, which means Mary carried 4 + 3 = 7 buckets. Iris carried 1 less bucket than Mary, which means Iris carried 7 - 1 = 6 buckets. Each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand, so collectively, Eden carried 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of sand, Mary carried 7 * 2 = 14 pounds of sand, and Iris carried 6 * 2 = 12 pounds of sand. The total pounds of sand carried by all three together is 8 + 14 + 12 = 34 pounds.

First, we need to determine how many buckets each person carried. 

Eden carried 4 buckets.
Mary carried 3 more buckets than Eden, so she carried \(4 + 3 = 7\) buckets.
Iris carried 1 less bucket than Mary, so she carried \(7 - 1 = 6\) buckets.

Now, we calculate how many pounds of sand each person carried. Since each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand, we multiply the number of buckets by 2.

Eden's sand: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds.
Mary's sand: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) pounds.
Iris's sand: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pounds.

Next, we add the total pounds of sand carried by Eden, Mary, and Iris:

Total sand \(= 8 + 14 + 12 = 34\) pounds.

To determine the total pounds of sand collected by Eden, Mary, and Iris, we first need to calculate the number of buckets each person carried.

Eden carried 4 buckets.
Mary carried 3 more buckets than Eden, so Mary carried \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) buckets.
Iris carried 1 less bucket than Mary, so Iris carried \( 7 - 1 = 6 \) buckets.

Now, we calculate the total number of buckets:
Eden's buckets: \( 4 \)
Mary's buckets: \( 7 \)
Iris's buckets: \( 6 \)

Total buckets = \( 4 + 7 + 6 = 17 \).

Each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand. Therefore, the total weight of the sand is:
Total weight = \( 17 \) buckets * \( 2 \) pounds per bucket = \( 34 \) pounds.

- Iris carried 1 less bucket than Mary, so she carried \(7 - 1 = 6\) buckets of sand.

Eden, Mary, and Iris collected a total of 34 pounds of sand.
<br>Eden carried 4 buckets × 2 pounds/bucket = 8 pounds of sand.
Mary carried 7 buckets × 2 pounds/bucket = 14 pounds of sand.
Iris carried 6 buckets × 2 pounds/bucket = 12 pounds of sand.
The total is 8 pounds (Eden) + 14 pounds (Mary) + 12 pounds (Iris) = 34 pounds of sand.

To find the total amount of sand collected, we need to determine how many buckets each person carried and then calculate the total amount of sand based on the number of buckets and the weight of each bucket.

First, we know Eden carried 4 buckets of sand.

Mary carried 3 more buckets of sand than Eden, so:
\[ \text{Mary's buckets} = 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Iris carried 1 less bucket of sand than Mary, so:
\[ \text{Iris's buckets} = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of buckets of sand carried by all three:
\[ \text{Total buckets} = 4 + 7 + 6 = 17 \]

Each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand, so the total weight of sand is:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 17 \times 2 = 34 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of sand they collected is 34 pounds.
