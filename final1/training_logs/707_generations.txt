###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Alice and Emily are selling oranges at the farmer's market. Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily did. In total, they sold 180 oranges. How many oranges did Alice sell?

#### ANS ####

120
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the number of oranges Emily sold as E. Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, Alice sold 2E oranges.

According to the problem, the total number of oranges sold by both Alice and Emily is 180. So we can write the equation as:

E + 2E = 180

Combining the terms on the left side gives us:

3E = 180

To find the value of E, we divide both sides by 3:

E = 180 / 3
E = 60

So Emily sold 60 oranges. Since Alice sold twice as many as Emily, Alice sold:

2 * 60 = 120 oranges

Thus, Alice sold 120 oranges.

<answer>
120
</answer>
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we first determined that if Emily sold E oranges, Alice sold 2E oranges. Since the total number of oranges they sold together is 180, we set up the equation E + 2E = 180. Simplifying this equation gives us 3E = 180, and solving for E gives us E = 60. Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, she sold 2 * 60 = 120 oranges.

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of oranges Emily sold as \( E \).

According to the problem, Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, so we can express the number of oranges Alice sold as \( 2E \).

The total number of oranges sold by both Alice and Emily is 180. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ E + 2E = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3E = 180 \]

To find the value of \( E \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ E = \frac{180}{3} = 60 \]

So Emily sold 60 oranges. Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, we calculate:

\[ 2E = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, Alice sold 120 oranges.

system
To solve this problem, let's denote the number of oranges Emily sold as \( E \). Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, the number of oranges Alice sold can be represented as \( 2E \).

According to the problem, the total number of oranges sold by both Alice and Emily is 180. So, we can write the equation:

\[ E + 2E = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3E = 180 \]

To find \( E \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ E = \frac{180}{3} = 60 \]

Now that we know Emily sold 60 oranges, we can find out how many oranges Alice sold by multiplying Emily's sales by 2:

\[ 2E = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, Alice sold 120 oranges.

Let's denote the number of oranges Emily sold as \( E \). According to the problem, Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, so Alice sold \( 2E \) oranges. The total number of oranges sold by both Alice and Emily is given as 180. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2E + E = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3E = 180 \]

To find \( E \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ E = \frac{180}{3} = 60 \]

So, Emily sold 60 oranges. Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, Alice sold \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) oranges.
