#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
In the first two weeks, Archibald eats 1 apple/day * 14 days/week * 2 weeks = 28 apples
Over the next three weeks, he eats the same number of apples as the total of the first two weeks, so he eats 28 apples.

Over the next two weeks, he eats 3 apples/day * 14 days/week * 2 weeks = 84 apples

In total, Archibald eats 28 apples + 28 apples + 84 apples = 130 apples

Therefore, he averages 130 apples/7 weeks = 18.57 apples/week

He eats 14 by the first two weeks because 7 x 2 = 14
Over the next 3 weeks, he eats 14 because 14 = 14
Over the next 2 weeks, he eats 12 because 3 x 4 = 12
So he eats 30 apples because 14 + 14 + 12 = 30

In the first two weeks, he eats 1 x 14 = 14 apples.
Over the next three weeks, he eats 14 apples the same number of times as the total of the first two weeks, so 14 x 14 = 196 apples.
Over the last two weeks he eats 3 x 14 = 42 apples.
He eats 14 + 196 + 42 = 252 apples in total.
He averages 252 x (1/7) = 36 apples per week.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####

system
Archibald eats 1 apple per day for two weeks, which totals 14 apples (1 apple/day * 14 days). Over the next three weeks, he eats the same number of apples as the total of the first two weeks, which is 14 apples (as calculated above).

Over the next two weeks, he eats 3 apples per day, which totals 6 * 3 = 18 apples.

In total, over the 7 weeks, Archibald eats 14 + 14 + 18 = 46 apples.

To find the average, divide the total number of apples by the number of weeks:

{eq}\frac{46\ \mathrm{apples}}{7\ \mathrm{weeks}} \approx 6.57\ \mathrm{apples/week}

</answer>
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apples Archibald eats over the 7 weeks, and then find the average by dividing this total by the number of weeks. For the first two weeks, he eats the same number of apples as in the previous two weeks, so that's 14 apples (1 apple per day times 14 days). For the next three weeks, he eats the same number as in the previous two weeks, which is also 14 apples. For the final two weeks, he eats 3 apples per day, which totals 18 apples (3 apples per day times 2 weeks). Adding these totals together gives us the total number of apples eaten over the 7 weeks, which is 46. The average number of apples per week is then calculated by dividing the total number of apples by the number of weeks, which is 46 apples divided by 7 weeks, approximately 6.57 apples per week.

Archibald eats 1 apple for 14 days in the first two weeks, which totals to 14 apples. In the next three weeks, he eats the same amount of apples as the total from the first two weeks, so he eats 14 apples again. In the final two weeks, he eats 3 apples a day, so that's 3 apples/day * 14 days = 42 apples. The total number of apples he eats over the 7 weeks is 14 (first 2 weeks) + 14 (second 2 weeks) + 42 (last 2 weeks) = 70 apples. The average number of apples eaten per week is 70/7 = 10 apples.

Archibald eats 1 apple a day for two weeks, which means he eats \(2 \times 7 = 14\) apples. Over the next three weeks, he eats the same number of apples as the total of the first two weeks, which is \(14\) apples. Over the next two weeks, he eats 3 apples a day, which means he eats \(2 \times 3 = 6\) apples. Adding these up, the total number of apples eaten over the 7 weeks is \(14 + 14 + 6 = 34\). To find the average number of apples eaten a week over these 7 weeks, we divide the total number of apples by the number of weeks, which gives \(34 \div 7 = 4.857142857142857\). Taking the average, we get \(4.\overline{857}\). Therefore, Archibald averages \(4.\overline{857}\) apples a week.

Archibald eats 1 apple per day for two weeks, which is 14 apples. For the next three weeks, he eats the same number of apples as the total of the first two weeks, so he eats 14 more apples over those three weeks. That makes 14 + 14 = 28 apples. Over the next two weeks, he eats 3 apples a day, which is 3 * 14 = 42 apples. Adding up the apples eaten over these 7 weeks, we have 14 + 28 + 42 = 84. To find the average number of apples he eats over 7 weeks, we divide 84 by 7, which equals 12.
