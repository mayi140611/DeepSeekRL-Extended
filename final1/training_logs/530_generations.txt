#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Since the question indicates that it takes 2 hours to recover each animal, and there are 3 lions (2 animals) and 2 rhinos (1 animal) that escaped, the total time spent recovering the animals would be 2 hours/animal * 3 animals (lions) + 2 animals (rhinos) = 6 + 2 = 8 hours.

system
The zoo spent time recovering 3 lions and 2 rhinos. Since it takes 2 hours to recover each animal, the total time spent recovering the animals is:

\( 3 \, \text{lions} \times 2 \, \text{hours/lion} + 2 \, \text{rhinos} \times 2 \, \text{hours/rhino} = 6 \, \text{hours} + 4 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{hours} \).

So, the zoo spent 10 hours recovering the animals.

The zoo recovered the 3 lions, which took 2 hours each, so 3 lions * 2 hours = 6 hours. The zoo also recovered the 2 rhinos, which took 2 hours each, so 2 rhinos * 2 hours = 4 hours. 

Therefore, the total time spent recovering animals is 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

The zoo had 3 lions and 2 rhinos escape, for a total of 5 animals. If it takes 2 hours to recover each animal, then the total time spent recovering the animals would be:

\[ 5 \text{ animals} \times 2 \text{ hours/animal} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####

system
To determine how long the zoo spent recovering the animals, we need to consider the total number of animals that escaped and the time it takes to recover each animal.

1. Total number of animals: 3 lions + 2 rhinos = 5 animals
2. Time to recover each animal: 2 hours

Now we multiply the total number of animals by the time it takes to recover each animal:

5 animals * 2 hours/animal = 10 hours

Therefore, the zoo spent 10 hours recovering the animals.

The zoo spent 2 hours per animal to recover them. Therefore, for 3 lions, it took \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours. For 2 rhinos, it took \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) hours. Adding both times together, the zoo spent \( 6 + 4 = 10 \) hours recovering all the animals.

To determine how long the zoo spent recovering the animals, we first need to calculate the total number of animals that escaped. There are 3 lions and 2 rhinos, so the total number of animals is:

\[ 3 \text{ lions} + 2 \text{ rhinos} = 5 \text{ animals} \]

Next, we know that it takes 2 hours to recover each animal. Therefore, to find the total recovery time, we multiply the total number of animals by the time it takes to recover each animal:

\[ 5 \text{ animals} \times 2 \text{ hours per animal} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the zoo spent 10 hours recovering the animals.

The zoo has 3 lions and 2 rhinos in total. Since it takes 2 hours to recover each animal, the total time spent recovering the animals is calculated as follows:

- For lions: 3 lions * 2 hours each = 6 hours
- For rhinos: 2 rhinos * 2 hours each = 4 hours

Adding these together: 6 hours (lions) + 4 hours (rhinos) = 10 hours.

Therefore, the zoo spent 10 hours recovering the animals.
