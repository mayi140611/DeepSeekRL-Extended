system
First, we need to determine the number of students in class A. Since 40% of the students are in class A, we calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Number of students in class A} = 40\% \times 80 = 0.40 \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we know that class B has 21 students fewer than class A. So, the number of students in class B is:

\[ \text{Number of students in class B} = \text{Number of students in class A} - 21 = 32 - 21 = 11 \]

The rest of the students are in class C. So, we calculate the number of students in class C as follows:

\[ \text{Number of students in class C} = \text{Total number of students} - (\text{Number of students in class A} + \text{Number of students in class B}) \]
\[ \text{Number of students in class C} = 80 - (32 + 11) = 80 - 43 = 37 \]

So, the number of students in class C is 37.

Class A has 0.4 * 80 students = 32 students.

Class B has 32 students - 21 students = 11 students.

Class C has 80 students - 32 students - 11 students = 37 students.

system
Let's start by determining the total number of students in class A. Since 40% of the 80 students are in class A, we calculate:

\[ 0.40 \times 80 = 32 \]

So, there are 32 students in class A.

Next, we know that class B has 21 students fewer than class A. Therefore, the number of students in class B is:

\[ 32 - 21 = 11 \]

Since the rest of the students are in class C, we can find the number of students in class C by subtracting the number of students in class A and class B from the total number of students:

\[ 80 - 32 - 11 = 37 \]

Thus, there are 37 students in class C.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( T = 80 \). According to the problem, 40% of the students are in class A, so the number of students in class A is \( 0.4T = 0.4 \times 80 = 32 \). 

The number of students in class B is 21 fewer than in class A, so the number of students in class B is \( 32 - 21 = 11 \).

The rest of the students are in class C. Therefore, the number of students in class C is \( T - \text{(students in classes A and B)} = 80 - (32 + 11) = 80 - 43 = 37 \).

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out how many students are in class C, we first need to figure out the number of students in classes A and B, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

40% of the students are in class A, so class A has:
40/100 * 80 = 32 students.

Class B has 21 students fewer than class A, so class B has:
32 - 21 = 11 students.

Now, adding the number of students in classes A and B gives us:
32 + 11 = 43 students.

Since the total number of students in the school is 80, and we've accounted for 43 students in classes A and B, the remaining students are in class C.

The number of students in class C is:
80 - 43 = 37 students.

system
Let's denote the total number of students as \( T \) and the number of students in class A as \( A \), in class B as \( B \), and in class C as \( C \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( T = 80 \)
2. \( A = 40\% \) of \( T \), so \( A = 0.4 \times 80 = 32 \)
3. \( B = A - 21 \)

First, we calculate the number of students in class B:
\[ B = 32 - 21 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the number of students in class C by subtracting the number of students in classes A and B from the total number of students:
\[ C = T - A - B = 80 - 32 - 11 = 37 \]

So, the number of students in class C is \( \boxed{37} \).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adam's school has 80 students in total, divided into three classes. Let's denote the number of students in class A as \( A \), class B as \( B \), and class C as \( C \).

2. We know that 40% of the students are in class A. So, \( A = 0.40 \times 80 \). Therefore, \( A = 32 \).

3. Class B has 21 students fewer than class A. So, \( B = A - 21 \). Since we found that \( A = 32 \), \( B = 32 - 21 = 11 \).

4. The total number of students in the school is the sum of the students in all three classes. So, \( A + B + C = 80 \). We already know \( A = 32 \) and \( B = 11 \), so \( C = 80 - 32 - 11 \).

5. Calculating \( C \): \( C = 80 - 32 - 11 = 37 \).

Class A has 40% of the students, so it has 80 * 0.40 = 32 students.

Class B has 21 students fewer than class A, so it has 32 - 21 = 11 students.

The rest are in class C. So, class C has the remaining number of students, which is 80 - 32 - 11 = 37 students.

Let's calculate the number of students in each class step by step.

First, the total number of students is 80. Let's assume the percentage of students in class A is \( x \). Then, the number of students in class A can be represented as \( 80 \times \frac{x}{100} \).

Given that 40% of the students are in class A, we have:
\[ \text{Number of students in class A} = 80 \times \frac{40}{100} = 72 \]

Next, we know that class B has 21 students fewer than class A. So, the number of students in class B can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of students in class B} = 72 - 21 = 51 \]

Now, the rest of the students are in class C. Since the total number of students is 80, we subtract the number of students in classes A and B from the total to find the number of students in class C:
\[ \text{Number of students in class C} = 80 - 72 - 51 = -13 \]

So, Adam has 51 students in class B, 49 students in class C, and 14 students in class A. If they need further guidance on setting up the correct mathematical operations to find 'x' or make sure the total calculation is correct, let me know.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that:
- \( S = 80 \) students.
- 40% of the students are in class A, which means \( 0.40 \times 80 = 32 \) students are in class A.

Since class B has 21 students fewer than class A, the number of students in class B is:
\[ 32 - 21 = 11 \]

Now, the rest of the students are in class C. So, the number of students in class C is:
\[ 80 - 32 - 11 = 37 \]

Therefore, the number of students in class C is 37.

Let's calculate first the number of students in class A. 40% of 80 students amounts to 0.40 * 80 = 32 students. Now, since the number of students in class B is 21 fewer than in class A, class B has 32 - 21 = 11 students. The total number of students in all three classes adds up to 80 students. Hence, the number of students in class C is 80 - 32 - 11 = 37 students.

The total number of students is 80. 40% of them are in class A, so the number of students in class A is calculated by multiplying 40% by the total number of students:
\[ \text{Students in class A} = 80 \times \frac{40}{100} = 32 \]

Class B has 21 students fewer than class A, so the number of students in class B is:
\[ \text{Students in class B} = 32 - 21 = 11 \]

To find the number of students in class C, which are the remaining ones after accounting for class A and B, we subtract the number of students in classes A and B from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Students in class C} = 80 - (32 + 11) = 80 - 43 = 37 \]
