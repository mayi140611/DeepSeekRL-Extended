###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Marcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup.

Let's think through this step-by-step.

First, determine how many tubes of lip gloss Marcy has in total. She is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss and each tub holds 2 tubes, so:

\[ 6 \text{ tubs} \times 2 \text{ tubes per tub} = 12 \text{ tubes} \]

Next, let's see how many people can be served by this amount of lip gloss. Each tube of lip gloss can serve 3 people, so with 12 tubes:

\[ 12 \text{ tubes} \times 3 \text{ people per tube} = 36 \text{ people} \]

So, Marcy is painting makeup for 36 people in total.

To find out how many people Marcy is painting with makeup, let's break down the information given:

1. Each tube of lip gloss is enough for 3 people.
2. Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss.
3. Each tub holds 2 tubes of lip gloss.

To find out how many people Marcy is painting with makeup, we need to calculate the total number of tubes of lip gloss she has and then divide by the number of tubes needed per person.

First, Marcy has 6 tubs of lip gloss, and each tub holds 2 tubes of lip gloss. Therefore, the total number of tubes is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Next, we know that each tube of lip gloss is enough for 3 people. Therefore, the total number of people that can be painted with 12 tubes of lip gloss is:
\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \]

So, Marcy is painting makeup for 36 people.

To find out how many people Marcy is painting with makeup, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

First, let's calculate the number of tubes of lip gloss Marcy brings:

Number of tubes = Number of tubs * Number of tubes per tub
Number of tubes = 6 * 2
Number of tubes = 12

Now that we know Marcy has 12 tubes of lip gloss, we can calculate how many people she can paint with this amount, given that each tube holds enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup:

Total number of people = Number of tubes * Number of people per tube
Total number of people = 12 * 3
Total number of people = 36

Thus, Marcia is painting makeup for 36 people.
