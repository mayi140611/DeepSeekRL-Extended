To find out how many hours it will take Veronica to pit all the cherries, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cherries needed: 3 pounds * 80 cherries/pound = 240 cherries.
2. Calculate the total time needed to pit the cherries: 240 cherries / 20 cherries/10 minutes = 120 minutes.
3. Convert minutes to hours: 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours.

So it will take Veronica 2 hours to pit all the cherries.

To determine how many hours it will take Veronica to pit all the cherries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cherries Veronica needs.
2. Determine how long it takes to pit one pound of cherries.
3. Calculate the total time required to pit all the cherries.
4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cherries.**

Veronica needs 3 pounds of pitted cherries, and there are 80 cherries in one pound. Therefore, the total number of cherries is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times 80 \text{ cherries/pound} = 240 \text{ cherries} \]

**Step 2: Determine how long it takes to pit one pound of cherries.**

It takes 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries. Therefore, the time it takes to pit one cherry is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ cherries}} = 0.5 \text{ minutes/cherry} \]

Now, we need to find out how many chunks of 20 cherries are in 240 cherries:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cherries}}{20 \text{ cherries/chunk}} = 12 \text{ chunks} \]

Since it takes 10 minutes to pit each chunk of 20 cherries, the total time to pit all 12 chunks is:
\[ 12 \text{ chunks} \times 10 \text{ minutes/chunk} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required to pit all the cherries.**

Since 1 pound equals 80 cherries, 240 cherries equal 3 pounds. We already calculated the time to pit 1 pound, which is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time to pit all 240 cherries is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ minutes/pound} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 4: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.**

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert 30 minutes to hours:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{0.5}

First, we need to find out how many cherries Veronica has in total. She needs 3 pounds of cherries and there are 80 cherries in one pound, so she has:
\( 3 \text{ pounds} \times 80 \text{ cherries/pound} = 240 \text{ cherries} \)

Next, we need to determine how many sets of 20 cherries are in 240 cherries:
\( \frac{240 \text{ cherries}}{20 \text{ cherries/set}} = 12 \text{ sets} \)

It takes 10 minutes to pit each set of 20 cherries. Therefore, the total time to pit all the cherries is:
\( 12 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes/set} = 120 \text{ minutes} \)

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes into hours:
\( \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \)

So, it will take Veronica 2 hours to pit all the cherries.

Veronica needs 3 pounds of cherries, and there are 80 cherries in one pound, so she needs \(3 \times 80 = 240\) cherries in total. It takes her 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries, so to pit 240 cherries, it would take \(240 \div 20 = 12\) sets of 10 minutes, which is 120 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take her \(120 \div 60 = 2\) hours to pit all the cherries.

First, we need to calculate the total number of cherries Veronica needs. Since she needs 3 pounds of cherries and there are 80 cherries in one pound, we multiply these two numbers together:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times 80 \text{ cherries/pound} = 240 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, we determine how many minutes it will take to pit all 240 cherries. Given that it takes 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries, we can find the time required for 240 cherries by setting up a proportion:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ cherries}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{240 \text{ cherries}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{10 \text{ minutes} \times 240 \text{ cherries}}{20 \text{ cherries}} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now we convert the minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Veronica 2 hours to pit all the cherries.

To find out how many minutes it will take Veronica to pit all the cherries, we first need to determine the total number of cherries she needs and then calculate the time based on the rate she can pit them.

Veronica needs 3 pounds of cherries, and there are 80 cherries per pound. So, the total number of cherries needed is:
\[
3 \text{ pounds} \times 80 \text{ cherries per pound} = 240 \text{ cherries}
\]

Next, we know it takes 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries. To find out how many sets of 20 cherries are in 240 cherries, we divide 240 by 20:
\[
240 \text{ cherries} \div 20 \text{ cherries per set} = 12 \text{ sets}
\]

Since it takes 10 minutes to pit one set of 20 cherries, the total time it will take Veronica to pit all the cherries is:
\[
12 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes per set} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we need to convert the total minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[
120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it will take Veronica 2 hours to pit all the cherries.

First, let's calculate the total number of cherries Veronica needs. Since there are 80 cherries in one pound and she needs 3 pounds, we multiply that by 3 to get the total number of cherries:

\[ 80 \, \text{cherries/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 240 \, \text{cherries} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cherries she can pit in one minute. Since it takes her 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries, we can determine how many cherries she can pit per minute:

\[ 20 \, \text{cherries} / 10 \, \text{minutes} = 2 \, \text{cherries/minute} \]

Now we need to calculate how long it will take her to pit all 240 cherries:

\[ 240 \, \text{cherries} / 2 \, \text{cherries/minute} = 120 \, \text{minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \, \text{minutes} / 60 \, \text{minutes/hour} = 2 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it will take Veronica 2 hours to pit all the cherries.

To find out how many cherries Veronica has in total, we multiply the number of pounds needed by the number of cherries per pound:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times 80 \text{ cherries per pound} = 240 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, to determine how long it will take to pit all the cherries, we first find out how many cherries can be pitted per minute. Since it takes 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries, we divide the number of minutes by 10 to find the number of cherries pit per minute:
\[ 20 \text{ cherries} \div 10 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ cherries per minute} \]

Now that we know Veronica can pit 2 cherries per minute, we can calculate the total time needed to pit all the cherries by dividing the total number of cherries by the number of cherries pitted per minute:
\[ 240 \text{ cherries} \div 2 \text{ cherries per minute} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, to convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

To determine how long it will take Veronica to pit all the cherries, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cherries Veronica needs.
2. Determine the total time required to pit all the cherries.
3. Convert the total time into hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cherries needed.
Veronica needs 3 pounds of cherries, and there are 80 cherries in one pound.
3 pounds * 80 cherries/pound = 240 cherries

Step 2: Determine the total time required to pit all the cherries.
Veronica takes 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries. To find out how many batches of 20 cherries there are in 240 cherries, we divide:
240 cherries / 20 cherries/batch = 12 batches

Each batch takes 10 minutes to pit, so the total time is:
12 batches * 10 minutes/batch = 120 minutes

Step 3: Convert the total time into hours.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take Veronica 2 hours to pit all the cherries.

Veronica needs 3 pounds of pitted cherries, and there are 80 cherries in one pound. Therefore, the total number of cherries needed is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times 80 \text{ cherries per pound} = 240 \text{ cherries} \]

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cherries}}{20 \text{ cherries per group}} = 12 \text{ groups} \]

Since it takes 10 minutes for each group, the total time required to pit all the cherries is:
\[ 12 \text{ groups} \times 10 \text{ minutes per group} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
