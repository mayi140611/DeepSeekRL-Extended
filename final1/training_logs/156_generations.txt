Let's represent the cost of the sandwich as S and the cost of the juice as J. S = $4 and J = 2S.
We can represent the cost of the juice as J = 2S.
We can represent the cost of the sandwich and juice as S + J.
We can represent the cost of the milk as 0.75 * (S + J).
S + J + 0.75 * (S + J) = 4 + 2(4) + 4(2) + 2(2) + 5(2) = $46.
George paid $46 for his food.

Let's break down the costs:
- Sandwich cost: $4
- Juice cost: Two times more expensive than the sandwich = 2 * $4 = $8

Total cost of sandwich and juice:
$4 (sandwich) + $8 (juice) = $12

- The bottle of milk cost was 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice.
75% of $12 = 0.75 * $12 = $9

Total cost of George's food:
$12 (sandwich and juice) + $9 (milk) = $21

Therefore, George paid $21 for his food.

Let's start by calculating the cost of the juice. Since the juice is two times more expensive than the sandwich, which cost $4, the cost of the juice is:

\[ \text{Cost of juice} = 2 \times \text{Cost of sandwich} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the sandwich and juice:

\[ \text{Total cost of sandwich and juice} = \text{Cost of sandwich} + \text{Cost of juice} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the bottle of milk is 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice. To find 75% of $12:

\[ \text{Cost of milk} = 75\% \times 12 = \frac{75}{100} \times 12 = 0.75 \times 12 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the sandwich, the juice, and the milk to find the total cost George paid:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of sandwich} + \text{Cost of juice} + \text{Cost of milk} = 4 + 8 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

The sandwich costs $4, so the juice costs 2 * $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.
The total cost of the sandwich and juice is $4 + $8 = $<<4+8=12>>12.
The milk costs 75% of this total, which is 0.75 * $12 = $9.

Therefore, George paid $12 for his food.

Let's calculate the cost of the sandwich first. The sandwich costs $4.

The juice was two times more expensive than the sandwich, so:
Juice cost = 2 * Sandwich cost = 2 * $4 = $8

The bottle of milk cost was 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice:
Milk cost = 0.75 * (Sandwich cost + Juice cost)
Milk cost = 0.75 * ($4 + $8)
Milk cost = 0.75 * $12
Milk cost = $9

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the food:
Total cost = Sandwich cost + Juice cost + Milk cost
Total cost = $4 + $8 + $9
Total cost = $21

George paid $21 for his food.
