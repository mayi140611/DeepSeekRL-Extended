The second tank is 48/2= 24 gallons.
The first tank can hold 24*3= 72 fish.
The second tank can hold 24*2= 48 fish.
The first tank has 72 - 48= 24 more fish than the second tank.
Therefore, the answer is 24.

Gail has two fish tanks. Let the size of the second tank be X gallons.
First tank = 2 * size of second tank.
Second tank = X gallons.
48 = 2 * X.
X = 48 / 2.
X = 24 gallons.
Size of the second tank is 24 gallons.
Gail follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish in the first tank.
Number of fish in first tank = Number of gallons / Number of gallons per inch = 48 / 2 = 24.
Gail follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish in the second tank.
Number of fish in second tank = Number of gallons / Number of gallons per inch = 24 / 2 = 12.
Gail has 12 more fish in the second tank than the first tank.
One fish in the first tank eats another fish.
Gail would have 24 - 12 - 1 = 11 fish in the first tank.
Gail would have 11 - 12 = -1 fish in the first tank.
-1 fish means that Gail would have one fish in the second tank and zero fish in the first tank.

Let's denote the size of the second tank as \( x \) gallons. The first tank, being twice the size of the second, would be \( 2x \) gallons.

Given that there are 48 gallons of water in the first tank, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 48 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

So, the second tank is 24 gallons and the first tank is 48 gallons.

Next, we need to determine how many fish can fit in each tank given the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. 

In the first tank, which is 48 gallons, with fish measuring 3 inches each, we can fit:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ gallons}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 16 \text{ fish} \]

In the second tank, which is 24 gallons, with fish measuring 2 inches each, we can fit:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ gallons}}{2 \text{ inches}} = 12 \text{ fish} \]

Now, if one of the first tank fish eats another, we need to find how many more fish would be in the first tank than in the second tank. Initially, there would be 16 fish in the first tank and 12 fish in the second tank. If one fish in the first tank dies, the number of fish in the first tank would be 15.

Thus, compared to the second tank, there would be:
\[ 15 \text{ fish in the first tank} - 12 \text{ fish in the second tank} = 3 \text{ fish} \]

So, if one of the first tank fish eats another, Gail would have 3 more fish in the first tank than in the second tank.

The first tank is twice the size of the second tank, meaning the first tank has 48 gallons of water. Each gallon of water corresponds to one inch of fish, so the first tank can hold 48 fish. Each fish in the first tank is 3" in length, so there are 48/3 = 16 fish in the first tank. The second tank can hold the same volume of water, so it has 48 fish. However, if one of the first tank fish eats another, the first tank would have 15 fish. Consequently, it would have 16-15 = 1 fewer fish than the second tank. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the sizes of the tanks:**
   - The first tank is twice the size of the second tank.
   - The first tank has 48 gallons of water.

   Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank, the second tank must have half as much water:
   \[
   \text{Water in the second tank} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of fish in each tank:**
   - Gail follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish.
   - The second tank has 2-inch fish:
     \[
     \text{Number of fish in the second tank} = \frac{24 \text{ gallons}}{2 \text{ inches}} = 12 \text{ fish}
     \]
   - The first tank has 3-inch fish:
     \[
     \text{Number of fish in the first tank} = \frac{48 \text{ gallons}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 16 \text{ fish}
     \]

3. **Account for the fish eating incident:**
   - One of the first tank fish eats another, so one fish is no longer in the first tank.
   - A fish eats another, so the number of fish in the first tank decreases by one:
     \[
     \text{Number of fish in the first tank after the incident} = 16 - 1 = 15 \text{ fish}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of additional fish in each tank:**
   - Compare the fish in the first tank after the incident to the fish in the second tank:
     \[
     \text{Number of additional fish in the first tank} = 15 - 12 = 3 \text{ fish}
     \]

**Conclusion:**
Gail would have 3 more fish in the first tank than in the second tank.

Let's start by determining the size of the second tank. We know that the first tank is twice the size of the second tank and it has 48 gallons of water. Therefore, the second tank must have half the amount of water as the first tank. So the second tank has:

\[ 48 \text{ gallons} \div 2 = 24 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the number of fish in each tank. The first tank can hold fish according to the rule of 48 gallons of water divided by 1 gallon per inch. Since each fish is 2 inches long, the number of fish in the first tank is:

\[ 48 \text{ gallons} \div 2 \text{ inches/inch fish} = 24 \text{ fish} \]

For the second tank, we divide the 24 gallons by 1 gallon per inch (where each fish is 3 inches long):

\[ 24 \text{ gallons} \div 3 \text{ inches/inch fish} = 8 \text{ fish} \]

If one of the fish in the first tank eats another, then one more fish is removed from the first tank. So in the first tank, the number of fish would be:

\[ 24 - 1 = 23 \text{ fish} \]

The number of fish in the second tank remains:

\[ 8 \text{ fish} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the number of fish between the first and second tanks:

\[ 23 \text{ fish} - 8 \text{ fish} = 15 \text{ fish} \]

Therefore,

To answer this question, we need to determine the capacities of the two tanks based on the information given and then compare the total number of fish possible in each tank.

1. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank and has 48 gallons of water. Therefore, the second tank has 48/2 = 24 gallons of water.
2. With a rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, we can find the maximum number of fish Gail can keep in each: 
   - For the second tank (24 gallons of water and each fish is 2 inches long): 24 / 2 = 12 Fish
   - For the first tank (48 gallons of water and each fish is 3 inches long): 48 / 3 = 16 Fish
3. If one of the first tank fish eats another, the first tank would have 1 Fish - 1 Fish = 0 Fish. 
4. Therefore, the first tank would then have 0 Fish and the second tank already has 12 Fish.

To find out how many more fish Gail would have in the first tank than in the second tank:

- First tank: 0 Fish
- Second tank: 12 Fish
- Difference: 12 Fish - 0 Fish = 12 Fish

**Answer:** Gail would have 12 more fish in the second tank than in the first tank if one of the first tank fish eats another.

Gail has two fish tanks. Let's denote the size of the second tank as \( x \) gallons. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank, so it has \( 2x \) gallons of water. Since the first tank has 48 gallons of water, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 48 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]
So, the second tank is 24 gallons, and the first tank is \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) gallons.

Next, we determine how many fish each tank can hold under the given conditions. The rule is one gallon of water per inch of fish. For the second tank, with fish that are 2 inches long:
\[ \text{Number of fish in the second tank} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

For the first tank, with fish that are 3 inches long:
\[ \text{Number of fish in the first tank} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]

Now, if one of the first tank fish eats another, one of the 16 fish is effectively removed, leaving:
\[ 16 - 1 = 15 \]
So, the first tank has 15 fish and the second tank has 12 fish.

To find how many more fish are in the first tank than the second tank:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, Gail would have **3 more fish** in the first tank than the second tank after one of the first tank fish's death.

To determine how many more fish Gail would have in the first tank than in the second tank after one fish in the first tank eats another, we first need to find the size of the second tank.

Given:
- The first tank is twice the size of the second tank.
- The first tank has 48 gallons of water.

Let the size of the second tank be \( x \) gallons. Therefore, the first tank has \( 2x \) gallons. Since the first tank has 48 gallons:
\[
2x = 48
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{48}{2} = 24
\]
So, the second tank is 24 gallons.

Next, we calculate the number of fish in each tank. The rule is one gallon of water per inch of fish.

For the second tank, with 24 gallons of water and two-inch fish:
\[
\text{Number of fish in the second tank} = 24 \text{ gallons} \div 2 \text{ inches per fish} = 12 \text{ fish}
\]

For the first tank, with 48 gallons of water and three-inch fish:
\[
\text{Number of fish in the first tank} = 48 \text{ gallons} \div 3 \text{ inches per fish} = 16 \text{ fish}
\]

After one fish in the first tank eats another, the first tank will have one fewer fish:
\[
\text{Number of fish in the first tank} = 16 - 1 = 15 \text{ fish}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the number of fish between the first and second tanks:
\[
\text{Difference} = 15 \text{ fish in the first tank} - 12 \text{ fish in the second tank} = 3 \text{ fish}
\]

Thus, Gail would have \(\boxed{3}\) more fish in the first tank than in the second tank.

Let's break it down:

1. Gail has two fish tanks. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank.
2. The first tank has 48 gallons of water.
3. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank.
4. She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish.
   - For the first tank, if both fish are 3 inches, that would be \(3 \times 48 = 144\) fish.
   - If one fish eats another, we assume it's one less fish, thus \(144 - 1 = 143\) fish in the first tank.
5. For the second tank, since there are 288 gallons (48 gallons each tank, twice the size), and each inch of fish needs 1 gallon of water, there would be \(288 / 2 = 144\) fish (assuming all fish are 2 inches).
6. Now, if we add the fish eaten scenario where 1 fish is eaten in the first tank, then there would be 142 fish in the first tank and still 144 fish in the second tank.

Comparing the two tanks:
- First tank has 142 fish.
- Second tank has 144 fish.

To find out how many more fish would be in the first tank:
\(144 - 142 = 2\)

Therefore, Gail would have 2 more fish in the second tank than the first tank.

2. **Determine the number of fish in each tank:**
   - She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish.
   - Gail keeps two-inch fish in the second tank, so the number of fish in the second tank is \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) fish.
   - Gail keeps three-inch fish in the first tank, so the number of fish in the first tank is \( \frac{48}{3} = 16 \) fish.

3. **Account for the fish in the first tank that eats a fish in the second tank:**
   - Let's assume that one of the fish in the first tank takes a bite out of one of the fish in the second tank. This situation doesn't change the count of fish in either tank, as it just redistributes the fish without changing the overall count.
   - The number of fish remains the same, but the counts are now:
     - First tank: 16 fish
     - Second tank: 12 fish

The first tank is twice as large as the second tank, which means the second tank is 24 gallons since 48 / 2 = 24 gallons. The second tank contains one fish per gallon of water, so with 24 gallons it contains 24 fish. The first tank has two fish for every gallon of water, so it has 48 fish. The difference is 48 - 24 = 24. The first tank has 2 more fish than the second tank before the fish fight, but then one fish dies from the fight, leaving it with 23 fish.

Let's start by finding out the size of the second tank. Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank, we can calculate the volume of the second tank as follows:

First tank: 48 gallons
Second tank: 48 gallons / 2 = 24 gallons

Next, we'll calculate the number of fish in each tank. The rule is one gallon of water per inch of fish. For the second tank:

Second tank fish = 24 gallons / 2 inches/inch = 24 fish

For the first tank:

First tank fish = 48 gallons / 3 inches/inch = 16 fish

Now, if one of the first tank fish eats another, the first tank would have 15 fish. So the number of fish in each tank now is:

Second tank fish: 24 fish
First tank fish: 15 fish

To find out how many more fish Gail would have in the first tank than the second tank, we subtract the number of fish in the second tank from the number of fish in the first tank:

Additional fish in first tank: 15 fish - 24 fish = -9 fish

Since the result is negative, it means Gail would have 9 fewer fish in the first tank than in the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another.

First, we determine the size of the second tank:
The first tank is twice the size of the second tank, and it contains 48 gallons of water.
So, the second tank has:
\[ \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we use the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish to calculate the number of fish in each tank.

For the first tank, which can hold 48 gallons of water and each fish is 3 inches:
\[ \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ fish} \]

For the second tank, which can hold 24 gallons of water and each fish is 2 inches:

Now, if one of the first tank fish eats another, the first tank will lose one more fish. Therefore, the first tank will have:
\[ 16 - 1 = 15 \text{ fish} \]

So, the number of fish in the second tank remains:
\[ 12 \text{ fish} \]

Finally, to find out how many more fish are in the first tank than in the second tank:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \text{ more fish} \]

2. **Fish Count in the First Tank**:
   - 2-inch fish: 36 inches of fish (since the first tank can hold 48 gallons)
   - 3-inch fish: 16 inches of fish (since the first tank's capacity is 48 gallons)
   - One 3-inch fish eats another, reducing the number of 3-inch fish by one. So, the total number of 3-inch fish = 16 - 1 = 15

3. **Fish Count in the Second Tank**: 
   - 2-inch fish: 24 gallons
   - 3-inch fish: 0 inches (since the second tank is half full)
