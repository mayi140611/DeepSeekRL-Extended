To determine how many wooden building blocks can fit into the box, we need to calculate how many blocks can fit along each dimension of the box.

1. Along the height, if each block is 3 inches tall and the box is 8 inches tall, we can fit:
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67
   \]
   We can only fit whole blocks, so we can fit 2 blocks along the height.
   
2. Along the width, if each block is 2 inches wide and the box is 10 inches wide, we can fit:
   \[
   \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]
   We can fit 5 blocks along the width.
3. Along the length, if each block is 4 inches long and the box is 12 inches long, we can fit:
   \[
   \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]
   We can fit 3 blocks along the length.

To find the total number of blocks that can fit into the box, we multiply the number of blocks along each dimension:
\[
2 \times 5 \times 3 = 30
\]

Therefore, 30 building blocks can fit into the box.

To determine how many wooden building blocks can fit into the box, we need to calculate the volume of both the box and the building block, and then divide the volume of the box by the volume of the building block.

The volume of the box is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = \text{height} \times \text{width} \times \text{length} = 8 \times 10 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = 960 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The volume of each building block is:
\[ \text{Volume of the building block} = \text{height} \times \text{width} \times \text{length} = 3 \times 2 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Volume of the building block} = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we divide the volume of the box by the volume of the building block to find out how many blocks can fit:
\[ \text{Number of building blocks that can fit} = \frac{\text{Volume of the box}}{\text{Volume of the building block}} = \frac{960}{24} = 40 \]

So, the number of building blocks that can fit into the box is 40.

To determine how many building blocks fit into the box, we need to calculate how many blocks can fit along each dimension of the box: height, width, and length.

First, along the height:
- The box is 8 inches tall.
- Each block is 3 inches tall.
- Therefore, 8 ÷ 3 = 2 with a remainder of 2.
- This means we can fit 2 blocks along the height.

Next, along the width:
- The box is 10 inches wide.
- Each block is 2 inches wide.
- Therefore, 10 ÷ 2 = 5.
- This means we can fit 5 blocks along the width.

Finally, along the length:
- The box is 12 inches long.
- Each block is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, 12 ÷ 4 = 3.
- This means we can fit 3 blocks along the length.

Now, to get the total number of blocks that can fit in the box, we multiply the number of blocks along each dimension:
2 blocks (height) × 5 blocks (width) × 3 blocks (length) = 30 blocks.

Therefore, the answer is 30.

To determine how many wooden building blocks can fit into the box, we need to calculate the volume of both the box and a single building block, and then divide the volume of the box by the volume of a block.

1. Calculate the volume of the box:
   \[
   \text{Volume of the box} = \text{height} \times \text{width} \times \text{length} = 8 \, \text{inches} \times 10 \, \text{inches} \times 12 \, \text{inches} = 960 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. Calculate the volume of a single building block:
   \[
   \text{Volume of the block} = \text{height} \times \text{width} \times \text{length} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. Determine how many building blocks fit into the box:
   \[
   \text{Number of blocks} = \frac{\text{Volume of the box}}{\text{Volume of the block}} = \frac{960 \, \text{cubic inches}}{24 \, \text{cubic inches}} = 40
   \]

Thus, 40 building blocks can fit into the box.

To determine how many building blocks can fit into the box, we first need to calculate the volume of the box and the volume of each building block.

The volume of the box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = \text{height} \times \text{width} \times \text{length} = 8 \, \text{inches} \times 10 \, \text{inches} \times 12 \, \text{inches} = 960 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

The volume of one building block is:
\[ \text{Volume of one block} = \text{height} \times \text{width} \times \text{length} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many building blocks can fit along each dimension of the box:
- Along the height: \(\frac{8 \, \text{inches}}{3 \, \text{inches}} = 2.67\) (we can only fit whole blocks, so we take the integer part, which is 2 blocks).
- Along the width: \(\frac{10 \, \text{inches}}{2 \, \text{inches}} = 5\) (a whole number, so we can fit 5 blocks).
- Along the length: \(\frac{12 \, \text{inches}}{4 \, \text{inches}} = 3\) (a whole number, so we can fit 3 blocks).

Now, we multiply the number of blocks that fit along each dimension to find the total number of blocks that can fit into the box:
\[ \text{Total number of blocks} = 2 \, \text{blocks} \times 5 \, \text{blocks} \times 3 \, \text{blocks} = 30 \, \text{blocks} \]

Therefore, 30 building blocks can fit into the box.

To find out how many building blocks can fit into the box, we'll calculate the volume of both the box and the building block, and then divide the volume of the box by the volume of the building block.

The volume of the box is:
\[ V_{\text{box}} = \text{height} \times \text{width} \times \text{length} \]
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 8 \text{ inches} \times 10 \text{ inches} \times 12 \text{ inches} \]
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 960 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The volume of the building block is:
\[ V_{\text{block}} = \text{height} \times \text{width} \times \text{length} \]
\[ V_{\text{block}} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \]
\[ V_{\text{block}} = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, to find out how many building blocks can fit into the box, we divide the volume of the box by the volume of the building block:

\[ \text{Number of blocks} = \frac{V_{\text{box}}}{V_{\text{block}}} \]
\[ \text{Number of blocks} = \frac{960}{24} \]
\[ \text{Number of blocks} = 40 \]

So, 40 building blocks can fit into the box.

To determine how many building blocks can fit into the box, we need to calculate how many blocks can fit along each dimension of the box.

1. **Height calculation**: The box is 8 inches tall, and each block is 3 inches tall. So, the number of blocks that can fit along the height is:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{8}{3} \right\rfloor = 2 \text{ blocks}
   \]
   (we use the floor function because we can't have a fraction of a block.)

2. **Width calculation**: The box is 10 inches wide, and each block is 2 inches wide. So, the number of blocks that can fit along the width is:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{10}{2} \right\rfloor = 5 \text{ blocks}
   \]

3. **Length calculation**: The box is 12 inches long, and each block is 4 inches long. So, the number of blocks that can fit along the length is:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{12}{4} \right\rfloor = 3 \text{ blocks}
   \]

Now, to find the total number of blocks that can fit in the box, we multiply the number of blocks that can fit along each dimension:
\[
2 \text{ blocks (height)} \times 5 \text{ blocks (width)} \times 3 \text{ blocks (length)} = 30 \text{ blocks}
\]

Therefore, 30 building blocks can fit into the box.

To determine how many building blocks can fit into the box, we need to calculate how many blocks can fit along each dimension of the box.

1. **Height dimension:**
   - Height of the box: 8 inches
   - Height of the block: 3 inches

   Number of blocks along the height = \(\frac{8 \text{ inches}}{3 \text{ inches/block}} \approx 2.67\)

   Since we can only have whole blocks, we take the integer part, which is 2 blocks along the height.

2. **Width dimension:**
   - Width of the box: 10 inches
   - Width of the block: 2 inches

   Number of blocks along the width = \(\frac{10 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/block}} = 5 \text{ blocks}\)

3. **Length dimension:**
   - Length of the box: 12 inches
   - Length of the block: 4 inches

   Number of blocks along the length = \(\frac{12 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ inches/block}} = 3 \text{ blocks}\)

Now, to find the total number of blocks that can fit into the box, we multiply the number of blocks along each dimension:

\[ \text{Total number of blocks} = 2 \times 5 \times 3 = 30 \]

So, 30 building blocks can fit into the box.

To determine how many building blocks can fit into the box, we need to calculate how many of each dimension (height, width, length) a single building block can fit into the corresponding dimension of the box.

For the height:
- The box's height is 8 inches.
- Each building block's height is 3 inches.
- \( \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \) building blocks can fit in each dimension of height.

For the width:
- The box's width is 10 inches.
- Each building block's width is 2 inches.
- \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) building blocks can fit in the width.

For the length:
- The box's length is 12 inches.
- Each building block's length is 4 inches.
- \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) building blocks can fit in the length.

Now, to find the total number of building blocks that can fit into the box, we multiply the number of blocks that fit in each dimension:
\[ 2.67 \times 5 \times 3 = 39.75 \]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a block, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, 39 building blocks can fit into the box.

To determine how many building blocks can fit into the box, we need to calculate how many blocks fit along each dimension of the box and then multiply these numbers together.

1. **Height Adjustment:**
   - The box has a height of 8 inches.
   - A building block is 3 inches tall.
   - The number of blocks that can fit along the height is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{8}{3} = 2 \text{ R } 2
     \]
     This means 2 blocks fit along the height, with 2 inches remaining unoccupied.

2. **Width Adjustment:**
   - The box has a width of 10 inches.
   - A building block is 2 inches wide.
   - The number of blocks that can fit along the width is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{10}{2} = 5
     \]
     This means 5 blocks fit along the width completely.

3. **Length Adjustment:**
   - The box has a length of 12 inches.
   - A building block is 4 inches long.
   - The number of blocks that can fit along the length is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
     This means 3 blocks fit along the length completely.

Now, multiply the number of blocks that fit along each dimension:
\[
2 \text{ (height)} \times 5 \text{ (width)} \times 3 \text{ (length)} = 30
\]

Therefore, the number of building blocks that can fit into the box is 30.
