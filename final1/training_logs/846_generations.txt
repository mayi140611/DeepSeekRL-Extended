First, we need to find out how many chocolate chips Viviana has. Since she has five more chocolate chips than Susana, and Susana has 25 chocolate chips, Viviana has \(25 + 5 = 30\) chocolate chips.

Next, we need to find out how many vanilla chips Susana has. According to the information, Susana has \(3/4\) as many vanilla chips as Viviana. Since Viviana has 20 vanilla chips, Susana has \(20 \times \frac{3}{4} = 15\) vanilla chips.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chips they have together:
- Viviana has 30 chocolate chips and 20 vanilla chips, so the total for Viviana is \(30 + 20 = 50\).
- Susana has 25 chocolate chips and 15 vanilla chips, so the total for Susana is \(25 + 15 = 40\).
- The combined total number of chips is \(50 + 40 = 90\).

Therefore, the total number of chips they have together is 90.

Let's start by defining the variables:
- Let \( V_V \) be the number of vanilla chips Viviana has.
- Let \( C_S \) be the number of chocolate chips Susana has.
- Let \( C_V \) be the number of chocolate chips Viviana has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Viviana has 20 vanilla chips, so \( V_V = 20 \).
2. Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, so \( C_V = C_S + 5 \).
3. Susana has \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many vanilla chips as Viviana, so \( C_S = \frac{3}{4} V_V \).
4. Susana has 25 chocolate chips, so \( C_S = 25 \).

First, we calculate the number of vanilla chips Susana has:
\[ C_S = \frac{3}{4} V_V = \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15 \]

Next, we find the number of chocolate chips Viviana has:
\[ C_V = C_S + 5 = 25 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, we sum the number of vanilla chips, chocolate chips, and chocolate chips Susana has:
\[ \text{Total chips} = V_V + C_S + C_V + C_S = 20 + 15 + 30 + 25 = 90 \]

So, the total number of chips they have together is 90.

Let's denote the number of chocolate chips Susana has as \( x \). According to the problem, Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, so Viviana has \( x + 5 \) chocolate chips. We know that Viviana has 20 chocolate chips, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 5 = 20 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 \]
So, Susana has 15 chocolate chips.

Next, let's denote the number of vanilla chips Viviana has as \( y \). The problem states that Susana has \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many vanilla chips as Viviana, so Susana has \(\frac{3}{4}y\) vanilla chips. Since Viviana has 20 vanilla chips, we can set up the equation:
\[ y = 20 \]
Let's denote the number of vanilla chips Susana has as \( z \). Therefore, we have:
\[ z = \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15 \]
So, Susana has 15 vanilla chips.

Now, we calculate the total number of chips they have together by summing up the number of chocolate and vanilla chips for each person:
- Viviana’s total: \( 20 \) (vanilla) + \( 5 \) (chocolate) = \( 25 \) chips.
- Susana’s total: \( 15 \) (vanilla) + \( 15 \) (chocolate) = \( 30 \) chips.

The total number of chips they have together is:
\[ 25 + 30 = 55 \]

Let's denote the number of chocolate chips Susana has as \( S_c \) and the number of vanilla chips Viviana has as \( V_v \). According to the problem:
- \( V_v = 20 \)
- Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, so \( V_c = S_c + 5 \)
- Susana has \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many vanilla chips as Viviana, so \( S_v = \frac{3}{4} V_v \)

We can calculate Susana's vanilla chips as follows:
\[ S_v = \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15 \]

Now, we can find Susana's chocolate chips using the information that Susana has 25 chocolate chips:
\[ S_c = 25 \]

Since Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana and we already know Viviana has 20 vanilla chips, we can calculate Viviana's chocolate chips:
\[ V_c = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now we have:
- Viviana's vanilla chips: \( V_v = 20 \)
- Viviana's chocolate chips: \( V_c = 25 \)
- Susana's vanilla chips: \( S_v = 15 \)
- Susana's chocolate chips: \( S_c = 25 \)

The total number of chips they have together is:
\[ \text{Total chips} = V_v + V_c + S_v + S_c \]
\[ \text{Total chips} = 20 + 25 + 15 + 25 = 85 \]

So, the total number of chips they have together is \( 85 \).

To find the total number of chips that Viviana and Susana have together, we need to first determine how many chocolate and vanilla chips each of them has, based on the information provided.

1. Viviana has 20 vanilla chips.
2. Susana has 25 chocolate chips.
3. Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, so we calculate Viviana's chocolate chips as follows:
   \[
   \text{Viviana's chocolate chips} = \text{Susana's chocolate chips} + 5 = 25 + 5 = 30
   \]
4. Susana has \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many vanilla chips as Viviana, so we calculate Susana's vanilla chips as follows:
   \[
   \text{Susana's vanilla chips} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Viviana's vanilla chips} = \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15
   \]

Now that we know the number of each type of chip, we can calculate the total number of chips for each person and then combine them.

5. Viviana's total number of chips:
   \[
   \text{Viviana's total chips} = \text{Viviana's vanilla chips} + \text{Viviana's chocolate chips} = 20 + 30 = 50
   \]
6. Susana's total number of chips:
   \[
   \text{Susana's total chips} = \text{Susana's vanilla chips} + \text{Susana's chocolate chips} = 15 + 25 = 40
   \]

7. The total number of chips they have together is:
   \[
   \text{Total chips} = \text{Viviana's total chips} + \text{Susana's total chips} = 50 + 40 = 90

Let's start by determining the number of chocolate chips Susana has. We know that Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, and Susana has 25 chocolate chips. Therefore, Susana has \(25 + 5 = 30\) chocolate chips.
Next, let's calculate the number of vanilla chips Viviana has. According to the problem, Viviana has 20 vanilla chips.
Now we know both Viviana and Susana have their respective chips. To find the total number of chips, we simply add up all the chips: \(20 + 30 + 20 + 25 = 95\).

Therefore, the total number of chips they have together is 95.

Let's start by defining the variables for the number of chocolate chips Viviana and Susana have:
- Let \( V_v \) be the number of chocolate chips Viviana has.
- Let \( V_s \) be the number of chocolate chips Susana has.
- Let \( V_a \) be the number of vanilla chips Viviana has.
- Let \( S_v \) be the number of vanilla chips Susana has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana: \( V_v = S_v + 5 \)
2. Susana has \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many vanilla chips as Viviana: \( S_v = \frac{3}{4} V_a \)
3. Viviana has 20 vanilla chips: \( V_a = 20 \)
4. Susana has 25 chocolate chips: \( S_v = 25 \)

First, we substitute \( S_v = 25 \) into the second equation to find \( V_a \):
\[ S_v = \frac{3}{4} V_a \]
\[ 25 = \frac{3}{4} V_a \]
\[ V_a = \frac{25 \times 4}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \]
Since the number of chips must be an integer, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a need to recheck the problem statement. However, I'll proceed with the given values as they are.

Next, we substitute \( V_a = 20 \) into the second equation to find \( S_v \):
\[ S_v = \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15 \]
This contradicts the given \( S_v = 25 \), so let's verify the problem again. If Viviana has 20 vanilla chips and Susana has 25 chocolate chips, then \( V_v = V_s + 5 = 20 \) which means \( V_s = 15 \). This also doesn't match \( S_v = 25 \).

Since the problem states different values, let's assume \( V_v = V_s + 5 = 25 \) and \( S_v = \frac{3}{4} V_a \) still holds true. Then \( S_v = 15 \) and \( V_a = 20 \).

Now we can calculate the total number of chips they have together:
\[ \text{Total chocolates} = V_v + V_s = 25 + 25 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total vanillas} = V_a = 20 \]
\[ \text{Total chips} = \text{Total chocolates} + \text{Total vanillas} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

So, the total number of chips they have together is 70.

Let's denote the number of chocolate chips that Viviana has as \( V_ch \) and the number of chocolate chips that Susana has as \( S_ch \). According to the problem, Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, so we can write:

\[ V_ch = S_ch + 5 \]

We are also given that Susana has 25 chocolate chips, so:

\[ S_ch = 25 \]

Using this value, we can find out how many chocolate chips Viviana has:

\[ V_ch = 25 + 5 = 30 \]

Let's denote the number of vanilla chips that Viviana has as \( V_v \), and the number of vanilla chips that Susana has as \( S_v \). According to the problem, Viviana has 20 vanilla chips, so:

\[ V_v = 20 \]

The problem also states that Susana has \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many vanilla chips as Viviana, so we can write:

\[ S_v = \frac{3}{4} \times V_v \]

Substituting the value of \( V_v \) into this equation, we get:

\[ S_v = \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate and vanilla chips they have together. The total number of chocolate chips is:

\[ V_ch + S_ch = 30 + 25 = 55 \]

The total number of vanilla chips is:

\[ V_v + S_v = 20 + 15 = 35 \]

So, the total number of chips they have together is:

\[ (V_ch + S_ch) + (V_v + S_v) = 55 + 35 = 90 \]

To find the total number of chips, we need to calculate the number of chocolate and vanilla chips each person has and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many chocolate chips Susana has:
- Since Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, we can subtract 5 from Viviana's chocolate chips to find Susana's:
  \[ 25 - 5 = 20 \] 
  Therefore, Susana has 20 chocolate chips.

Next, let's calculate Viviana's vanilla chips:
- Viviana has 20 vanilla chips.

Now we know everything about both, so let's add them all together:
- Viviana's vanilla chips: 20
- Viviana's chocolate chips: 20  
  \[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Susana's chocolate chips: 25
- Susana's vanilla chips: 40

Adding Susana's Vanilla chips to the total:
- 25 vanilla chips from Susana
- Susana's chocolate chips: 25

Adding all these together:
\[ 40 + 25 + 40 + 25 = 130 \]

Therefore, the total number of chips they have together is **130**.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of chocolate chips that Viviana and Susana each have. 

Given that Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips, we can calculate the number of chocolate chips she has by using the information that she has five more chocolate chips than Susana. Since Susana has 25 chocolate chips, Viviana has \(25 + 5 = 30\) chocolate chips.

Next, we use the information that Susana has \(3/4\) as many vanilla chips as Viviana. Since Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips, Susana has \(20 \times 3 / 4 = 15\) vanilla chips.

Finally, we add up the chips in total: Viviana's chocolate chips, Susana's chocolate chips, Viviana's vanilla chips, and Susana's vanilla chips. This gives us:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 30 \text{ (Viviana's chocolate chips)} + 25 \text{ (Susana's chocolate chips)} + 20 \text{ (Viviana's vanilla chips)} + 15 \text{ (Susana's vanilla chips)} \]

Let's start by determining how many chocolate chips Viviana and Susana have. 

- Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips.
- Susana has 25 chocolate chips.
