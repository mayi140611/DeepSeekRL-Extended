First, calculate the total cost of the T-shirts: 6 T-shirts * $8 = $48.
Next, calculate the original cost of the sweaters: 4 sweaters * $18 = $72.
Calculate the original cost of the jackets: 5 jackets * $80 = $400.
Now, apply the 10% discount to the jackets: $400 * 0.10 = $40.
Subtract the discount from the original price of the jackets: $400 - $40 = $360.
Calculate the total cost of the items before tax: $48 + $72 + $360 = $480.
Now, calculate the sales tax on the total cost: $480 * 0.05 = $24.
Finally, add the sales tax to the total cost of the items: $480 + $24 = $504.

Kevin has to pay $504 for all the items, including the sales tax.

To calculate the total cost including sales tax and discounts, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price per jacket with the discount:**
   - Original price = $80
   - Discount percentage = 10%
   - Discount amount = 0.10 * $80 = $8
   - Discounted price = $80 - $8 = $72

2. **Calculate the total cost for six T-shirts:**
   - Price per T-shirt = $8
   - Number of T-shirts = 6
   - Total cost for T-shirts = $8 * 6 = $48

3. **Calculate the total cost for four sweaters:**
   - Price per sweater = $18
   - Number of sweaters = 4
   - Total cost for sweaters = $18 * 4 = $72

4. **Calculate the total cost for five jackets:**
   - Discounted price per jacket = $72
   - Number of jackets = 5
   - Total cost for jackets = $72 * 5 = $360

5. **Calculate the subtotal (total cost of all items before tax):**
   - Subtotal = Total cost for T-shirts + Total cost for sweaters + Total cost for jackets
   - Subtotal = $48 + $72 + $360 = $480

6. **Calculate the sales tax:**
   - Sales tax rate = 5%
   - Sales tax amount = 0.05 * $480 = $24

7. **Calculate the total cost including sales tax:**
   - Total cost = Subtotal + Sales tax
   - Total cost = $480 + $24 = $504

Therefore, Kevin has to pay $504 for all the items, including the sales tax.

To calculate the total cost for Kevin, we'll first determine the discounted price of each item, then sum up the costs for all items, including the sales tax.

1. **T-shirts**: Each T-shirt costs $8, and Kevin wants to buy 6.
   - Cost of T-shirts = $8 x 6 = $48

2. **Sweaters**: Each sweater costs $18, and Kevin wants to buy 4.
   - Cost of sweaters = $18 x 4 = $72

3. **Jackets**: Each jacket costs $80, but the jacket is on sale with a 10% discount.
   - Discounted price of jacket = $80 - ($80 x 10%)
   - Discounted price of jacket = $80 - $8 = $72
   - Cost of jackets = $72 x 5 = $360

Now, we'll add the costs of all items:
- Total cost before tax = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of sweaters + Cost of jackets
- Total cost before tax = $48 + $72 + $360 = $480

Next, we calculate the sales tax:
- Sales tax = Total cost before tax x 5%
- Sales tax = $480 x 5% = $480 x 0.05 = $24

Finally, we add the sales tax to the total cost before tax to find the final amount Kevin has to pay:
- Final amount to pay = Total cost before tax + Sales tax
- Final amount to pay = $480 + $24 = $504

Therefore, Kevin has to pay $504 for all the items, including the sales tax.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the T-shirts, sweaters, and jackets without the discount:

- Six T-shirts at $8 each: \(6 \times 8 = 48\)
- Four sweaters at $18 each: \(4 \times 18 = 72\)
- Five jackets at $80 each (after a 10% discount): \(5 \times (80 - 0.10 \times 80) = 5 \times 72 = 360\)

Total cost before tax: \(48 + 72 + 360 = 480\)

Next, we calculate the sales tax on the total cost:

- Sales tax at 5% on $480: \(0.05 \times 480 = 24\)

Finally, we calculate the total amount Kevin has to pay, including the sales tax:

- Total amount including tax: \(480 + 24 = 504\)

First, let's calculate the cost of each item before the discount:

- T-shirts: 6 * $8 = $48
- Sweaters: 4 * $18 = $72
- Jackets: 5 * $80 = $400

Now, apply the 10% discount on jackets only:

- Discount on jackets = 10% of $400 = 0.10 * $400 = $40

Subtract the discount from the original price of jackets:

- Discounted price of jackets = $400 - $40 = $360

Now, calculate the total cost for all items before sales tax:

- Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of sweaters + Cost of discounted jackets
- Total cost = $48 + $72 + $360 = $480

Next, calculate the sales tax:

- Sales tax = 5% of $480 = 0.05 * $480 = $24

Finally, add the sales tax to the total cost:

- Total cost including sales tax = $480 + $24 = $504

To calculate the total cost for Kevin, we need to consider the cost of the T-shirts, sweaters, and jackets before the discount and sales tax. 

First, let's calculate the cost without any discount or tax:

- T-shirts: 6 * $8 = $48
- Sweaters: 4 * $18 = $72
- Jackets: 5 * $80 = $400

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the jackets:

Discount on jackets = 10% of $400 = 0.10 * $400 = $40

Discounted cost of jackets = $400 - $40 = $360

Now, let's add the discounted cost of jackets:

Total for jackets and sweaters = $400 + $360 = $760

Now, we add the cost of T-shirts to this total:

Total for T-shirts and jackets = $48 + $760 = $808

Next, we calculate the sales tax on the total cost:

Sales tax = 5% of $808 = 0.05 * $808 = $40.40

Finally, we add the sales tax to the total:

Total amount to be paid = $808 + $40.40 = $848.40

Therefore, Kevin has to pay $848.40 for all the items, including the sales tax.

The total cost of the T-shirts is \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.

The total cost of the sweaters is \(4 \times 18 = 72\) dollars.

The total cost of the jackets before the discount is \(5 \times 80 = 400\) dollars.

Since the jacket is on sale with a 10% discount, the discount on each jacket is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars. So the sale price of each jacket is \(80 - 8 = 72\) dollars.

The total cost of the jackets after the discount is \(5 \times 72 = 360\) dollars.

The total cost of all the items before sales tax is \(48 + 72 + 360 = 480\) dollars.

The total cost of all the items including sales tax is \(480 + 480 \times 0.05 = 480 + 24 = 504\) dollars.

Let's break down the total cost of the items before tax:

- T-shirts: 6 T-shirts * $8 each = $48
- Sweaters: 4 sweaters * $18 each = $72
- Jackets: 5 jackets * $80 each = $400

Now, let's calculate the discount on the jackets:
Discounted price of jackets = $400 - (10% of $400) = $400 - $40 = $360

Now let's add up the total price before tax:
Total price before tax = $48 (T-shirts) + $72 (sweaters) + $360 (discounted jackets) = $480

Now we need to calculate the sales tax:
Sales tax = 5% of $480 = $24

Now we add the sales tax to the total price before tax to get the final amount Kevin has to pay:
Final amount = Total price before tax + Sales tax = $480 + $24 = $504

To calculate the total cost for Kevin, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jackets.
2. Determine the total cost for T-shirts, sweaters, and discounted jackets.
3. Calculate the sales tax on the total cost.
4. Add the sales tax to the total cost to get the final amount Kevin has to pay.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the jackets.
The original price of a jacket is $80, and there is a 10% discount.
\[ \text{Discounted price of one jacket} = 80 - (80 \times 0.10) = 80 - 8 = 72 \]
Since Kevin wants to buy five jackets, the total cost for the jackets is:
\[ \text{Total cost for jackets} = 72 \times 5 = 360 \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost for T-shirts, sweaters, and discounted jackets.
The price of one T-shirt is $8, so for six T-shirts:
\[ \text{Total cost for T-shirts} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \]
The price of one sweater is $18, so for four sweaters:
\[ \text{Total cost for sweaters} = 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

The total cost for all items before applying the sales tax is:
\[ \text{Total cost before tax} = 48 + 72 + 360 = 480 \]

Step 3: Calculate the sales tax on the total cost.
The sales tax rate is 5%, so the sales tax is:
\[ \text{Sales tax} = 480 \times 0.05 = 24 \]

Step 4: Add the sales tax to the total cost to get the final amount Kevin has to pay.
\[ \text{Total cost including tax} = 480 + 24 = 504 \]

Therefore, Kevin has to pay $504 for all the items, including the sales tax.

To determine the total cost including the sales tax, we'll break down the problem into steps and calculate the total cost for each item Kevin wants to buy.

1. **Calculate the total cost for each type of item without the discount:**
   - T-shirts: 
     \[
     6 \text{ T-shirts} \times \$8/\text{T-shirt} = \$48
     \]
   - Sweaters: 
     \[
     4 \text{ sweaters} \times \$18/\text{sweater} = \$72
     \]
   - Jackets: 
     \[
     5 \text{ jackets} \times \$80/\text{jacket} = \$400
     \]

2. **Apply the 10% discount to the jackets:**
   - Discount on jackets: 
     \[
     0.10 \times \$400 = \$40
     \]
   - Discounted price for jackets: 
     \[
     \$400 - \$40 = \$360
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before sales tax:**
   - Total cost:
     \[
     \$48 + \$72 + \$360 = \$480
     \]

4. **Apply the 5% sales tax to the total cost:**
   - Sales tax:
     \[
     0.05 \times \$480 = \$24
     \]

5. **Calculate the final total cost including sales tax:**
   - Final total cost:
     \[
     \$480 + \$24 = \$504
     \]

So, Kevin has to pay \$504 for all the items, including the sales tax.
