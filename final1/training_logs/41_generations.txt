To determine how much Rachel should budget, we need to first calculate the total amount Sara spent. Sara spent $50 on a pair of shoes and $200 on a dress, so the total amount she spent is:

\[ 50 + 200 = 250 \]

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara, so we need to multiply Sara's total spending by 2. Therefore, Rachel should budget:

\[ 250 \times 2 = 500 \]

So, Rachel should budget $500.

To calculate how much Rachel should budget, we first need to determine what Sara spent in total. She bought a pair of shoes for $50 and a dress for $200. Adding these together gives:

Total spent by Sara = Cost of shoes + Cost of dress
Total spent by Sara = $50 + $200
Total spent by Sara = $250

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara spent on shoes and dress, so we need to calculate 2 times the total amount Sara spent:

Rachel's budget = 2 × Total spent by Sara
Rachel's budget = 2 × $250
Rachel's budget = $500

Therefore, Rachel should budget $500.

To determine how much Rachel should budget, we first need to calculate the total amount Sara spent on the pair of shoes and dress:

- Sara's pair of shoes cost $50.
- Sara's dress cost $200.

So, the total amount Sara spent is:

\[ 50 + 200 = 250 \]

Now Rachel wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent. Therefore, we multiply the total amount Sara spent by 2:

\[ 250 \times 2 = 500 \]

Thus, Rachel should budget $500 if she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent on the pair of shoes and dress.

Reasoning:
Sara spends $50 on shoes and $200 on a dress, which totals $250. Since Rachel wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent, she should budget twice the amount Sara spent.

Calculation:
Rachel's budget = 2 * Sara's total spending
Rachel's budget = 2 * $250
Rachel's budget = $500

Answer:
Rachel should budget $500 for the pair of shoes and dress.

To find out how much Rachel should budget, we first need to calculate how much Sara spent in total.

Sara's total expenses = Cost of shoes + Cost of dress
Sara's total expenses = $50 + $200
Sara's total expenses = $250

Now, since Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara, we multiply Sara's total expenses by 2.

Rachel's budget = Sara's total expenses * 2
Rachel's budget = $250 * 2
Rachel's budget = $500

Therefore, Rachel should budget $500.

To determine how much Rachel should budget, we first need to calculate the total amount Sara spent on her pair of shoes and dress.

1. Calculate Sara's total expenditure:
   \[
   \text{Total expenditure by Sara} = \text{Cost of shoes} + \text{Cost of dress} = 50 + 200 = 250
   \]

2. Rachel wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent. Therefore, we need to multiply Sara's total expenditure by 2:
   \[
   \text{Rachel's budget} = 2 \times \text{Sara's total expenditure} = 2 \times 250 = 500

Sara's total expenditure is the sum of the cost of the pair of shoes and the dress. We first calculate Sara's total spending: \(50 + 200 = 250\). Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did. Therefore, we multiply Sara's total spending by 2 to determine how much Rachel should budget: \(250 \times 2 = 500\).

To calculate how much Rachel should budget, we first need to add up what Sara spent on her pair of shoes and dress. Sara's total expense is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the dress:

Sara's total expense = Cost of shoes + Cost of dress
Sara's total expense = $50 + $200 = $250

Since Rachel wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent, we multiply Sara's total expense by 2:

Rachel's budget = 2 * Sara's total expense
Rachel's budget = 2 * $250 = $500

Therefore, Rachel should budget $500 to spend twice as much as what Sara spent on her pair of shoes and dress.

To find out how much Rachel should budget, we first need to calculate how much Sara spent in total. 

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on shoes and dress. First, let's add the cost of the shoes and dress that Sara bought:

Cost of shoes: $50
Cost of dress: $200

Total cost (Sara): $50 + $200 = $250

Now, Rachel wants to spend twice as much:

Twice the cost (Rachel): $250 * 2 = $500

So, Rachel should budget $500 if she wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on new pairs of shoes and dresses.

To determine how much Rachel should budget, we first need to calculate the total amount Sara spent. Sara's expenses include the cost of the shoes and the dress. The cost of the shoes is $50 and the cost of the dress is $200. Adding these amounts together gives us:

\[ \text{Total spent by Sara} = \text{Cost of shoes} + \text{Cost of dress} = 50 + 200 = 250 \]

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara spent. Therefore, we need to calculate twice the total amount Sara spent:
