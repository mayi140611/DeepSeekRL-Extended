###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Lydia has a small pool she uses to bathe her dogs.  When full, the pool holds 60 gallons of water.  She fills her pool using the garden hose, which provides water at the rate of 1.6 gallons per minute.  Unfortunately, her pool has a small hole that leaks water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute.  How long will it take for her to fill the pool, in minutes?

system
The net rate at which Lydia fills her pool is the filling rate minus the leaking rate. The filling rate is 1.6 gallons per minute, and the leaking rate is 0.1 gallons per minute, so the net rate is \(1.6 - 0.1 = 1.5\) gallons per minute.

To find out how long it takes to fill the pool, we divide the total capacity of the pool by the net filling rate. The pool holds 60 gallons, and the net rate of filling is 1.5 gallons per minute, so it will take \(60 / 1.5 = 40\) minutes.

To determine how long it will take Lydia to fill her pool, we need to consider both the rate at which the water is being added to the pool and the rate at which it is leaking out.

First, let's calculate the net rate of water being added to the pool. The garden hose provides water at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, and the pool has a leak that removes water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute. Therefore, the net rate of water being added to the pool is:
\[ 1.6 \text{ gallons per minute} - 0.1 \text{ gallons per minute} = 1.5 \text{ gallons per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to add 60 gallons of water at this net rate. We do this by dividing the total volume of water needed by the net rate of water flow:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ gallons}}{1.5 \text{ gallons per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, it will take Lydia \(\boxed{40}\) minutes to fill the pool.

First, we need to determine the net rate at which Lydia is filling her pool. This is the difference between the rate at which she is filling the pool and the rate at which it is leaking. 

The pool is being filled at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, and it is leaking at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute. To find the net rate of filling, subtract the leak rate from the fill rate:

\( Net\ Rate = Fill\ Rate - Leak\ Rate \)
\( Net\ Rate = 1.6\ gallons\ per\ minute - 0.1\ gallons\ per\ minute \)
\( Net\ Rate = 1.5 \) gallons per minute

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to fill the pool using the capacity of the pool and the net rate of filling:

\( Time\ to\ Fill = \frac{Pool\ Capacity}{Net\ Rate} \)
\( Time\ to\ Fill = \frac{60 \text{ gallons}}{1.5 \text{ gallons\ per\ minute}} \)
\( Time\ to\ Fill = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Therefore, it will take Lydia 40 minutes to fill the pool.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the net rate at which Lydia is filling her pool. 

Initially, her garden hose fills the pool at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, but there is a leak that causes water to drain out at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute. Therefore, the net rate at which the pool is being filled is:

\(1.6 \text{ gallons/minute} - 0.1 \text{ gallons/minute} = 1.5 \text{ gallons/minute}\)

Now that we have the net rate of filling, we can calculate the time it will take to fill the pool by dividing the total volume of the pool by the net rate of filling:

\(60 \text{ gallons} \div 1.5 \text{ gallons/minute} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

To find the time it takes to fill the pool, we need to subtract the leak rate from the fill rate, which gives us the net rate of water being added to the pool each minute.

Fill rate: 1.6 gallons per minute
Leak rate: 0.1 gallons per minute

Net rate = Fill rate - Leak rate
Net rate = 1.6 gallons per minute - 0.1 gallons per minute
Net rate = 1.5 gallons per minute

Now, we can use the total capacity of the pool and the net rate to find the time it takes to fill the pool, using the formula:

Time = Total capacity / Net rate

Time = 60 gallons / 1.5 gallons per minute
Time = 40 minutes

Therefore, it will take 40 minutes for Lydia to fill the pool.

To find out how long it will take Lydia to fill her pool, we need to subtract the leak rate from the fill rate.

Step 1: Calculate the net fill rate
Net fill rate = Fill rate - Leak rate
The fill rate = 1.6 gallons per minute
The leak rate = 0.1 gallons per minute
Net fill rate = 1.6 - 0.1 = 1.5 gallons per minute

Step 2: Calculate the time needed to fill the pool
Time needed = Pool capacity / Net fill rate
Pool capacity = 60 gallons
Net fill rate = 1.5 gallons per minute
Time needed = 60 / 1.5 = 40 minutes

Therefore, it will take Lydia 40 minutes to fill her pool.

So, the final answer is 40 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which the pool is being filled. 

The garden hose adds 1.6 gallons per minute, while the leak removes 0.1 gallons per minute. The net rate of filling is therefore \(1.6 - 0.1 = 1.5\) gallons per minute.

Given that the pool holds 60 gallons, we can find the time it takes to fill the pool by dividing the total capacity by the net filling rate:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Capacity}}{\text{Net Rate}} = \frac{60 \text{ gallons}}{1.5 \text{ gallons per minute}} \]

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{60}{1.5} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Lydia 40 minutes to fill the pool.

To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Lydia is adding water to the pool and the rate at which the pool is leaking due to the hole. The net rate at which the pool is being filled is the difference between the rate of water coming in and the rate of water leaking out.

Net rate of filling = Rate of filling - Rate of leaking
                         = 1.6 gallons/minute - 0.1 gallons/minute
                         = 1.5 gallons/minute

Since the pool holds 60 gallons of water and it is being filled at a rate of 1.5 gallons per minute, we can calculate the time it will take to fill the pool by dividing the total volume of the pool by the net filling rate.

Time to fill = Total volume of the pool / Net rate of filling
             = 60 gallons / 1.5 gallons/minute
             = 40 minutes

Therefore, it will take Lydia 40 minutes to fill the pool.

To find the total time it takes to fill the pool, we need to calculate the rate at which water is being added to the pool, considering both the hose and the leak.

1. The hose adds water at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute.
2. The leak causes water to be lost at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute.

To find the net rate of change in water volume, we subtract the leak rate from the hose rate:

1. Net rate = Hoses rate - Leaks rate
1. Net rate = 1.6 gallons/minute - 0.1 gallons/minute
1. Net rate = 1.5 gallons/minute

Now, we can find the total time needed to fill the pool by dividing the pool's total capacity by the net rate:

2. Total time = Total pool capacity / Net rate
2. Total time = 60 gallons / 1.5 gallons/minute
2. Total time = 40 minutes

Therefore, it will take 40 minutes to fill the pool.

To determine how long it will take for Lydia to fill her pool, we need to account for both the rate at which water is being added to the pool and the rate at which water is leaking out. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Water added rate**: The garden hose fills the pool at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute.
2. **Water leaked rate**: The pool leaks at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute.
3. **Net rate of water increase**: The net rate of water increase is the difference between the rate of water added and the rate of water leaking, which is \(1.6 - 0.1 = 1.5\) gallons per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time required to fill the pool by dividing the total capacity of the pool by the net rate of water increase:

\[ \text{Time required} = \frac{\text{Total capacity}}{\text{Net rate}} = \frac{60 \text{ gallons}}{1.5 \text{ gallons per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Lydia 40 minutes to fill her pool.
