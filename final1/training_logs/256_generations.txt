system
To find the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest, we first need to determine the ratio representing the map distance to the actual distance. We know that 1/4 inch on the map corresponds to 8 miles in reality.

1/4 inch = 8 miles
So, the scale is 1 mile per 1/32 inch (since 8 miles / 1/4 = 32).

Next, we convert the distance between the towns on the map from fractions of an inch to the scale we just calculated. Pence and Hillcrest are 3 3/8 inches apart, which can be converted as follows:

3 3/8 = 3 + 3/8 = 24/8 + 3/8 = 27/8 inches

Now we apply the scale to the map distance. Since 1 mile corresponds to 1/32 inch, we multiply the map distance by 32 to find the actual distance:

27/8 inches * 32 = 108 miles

The actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is 108 miles.

To find the actual distance between the towns, we need to determine how many 1/4 inch segments are represented by 3 3/8 inches on the map. 

First, convert the mixed number 3 3/8 to an improper fraction:
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3) / 8 = 27/8 inches

Next, calculate how many 1/4 inch segments make up 27/8 inches:
(27/8) / (1/4) = (27/8) * (4/1) = 27 * 4 / (8 * 1) = 108 / 8 inches

Now, calculate the distance for each 1/4 inch segment:
108 / 8 inches = 13.5 miles

So, the actual distance between the towns is 13.5 miles.

We need to convert the map distance to the actual distance using the given ratio. The ratio is 1/4 inch representing 8 miles. 

First, calculate the miles represented by 1 inch:
\( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1/4 \text{ inch}} = 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ miles} \)

Next, calculate the miles represented by 3 inches:
\( 3 \times 32 \text{ miles} = 96 \text{ miles} \)

However, there is an additional \( 3/8 \) inch. We need to find out how this represents actual distance. Since each inch represents 32 miles, the \( 3/8 \) inch represents:
\( 32 \text{ miles/inch} \times 3/8 \text{ inch} = 4 \text{ miles} \)

Adding this difference to the total:
\( 96 \text{ miles} + 4 \text{ miles} = 100 \text{ miles} \)

Therefore, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is 100 miles.

To find the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest, we need to determine the scaling factor first. 

1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles. To find out how much actual distance 1 inch represents, we divide 8 miles by 1/4 inch:
8 miles ÷ 1/4 inch = 8 miles × 4 inches/inch = 32 inches.

Therefore, 1 inch on the map corresponds to 32 inches of actual road distance. Now, to find the actual distance between the towns:

The distance between Pence and Hillcrest on the map is 3 3/8 inches, which can be written as 3.375 inches.

To find the actual distance, we multiply 3.375 inches by the inches per inch (which is 32):

3.375 inches × 32 inches/inch = 108 miles.

Thus, the actual distance between the towns is 108 miles.

To find the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest, we first need to determine the scale of the map, which tells us how much of the distance on the map corresponds to a certain actual distance. We are given that \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch on the map represents 8 miles in actual distance.

Next, we calculate the number of 1/4 inch segments in 3 3/8 inches on the map. We'll convert 3 3/8 to an improper fraction to make calculations easier:
\[ 3 \frac{3}{8} = 3 + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{24}{8} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{27}{8} \]

Now, we determine how many 1/4 inch segments are in \( \frac{27}{8} \) inches:
\[ \frac{27}{8} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{27}{8} \times 4 = \frac{27 \times 4}{8} = \frac{108}{8} = 13.5 \]

This means there are 13.5 segments of \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch on the map. Since each segment corresponds to 8 miles in reality, we calculate the total actual distance by multiplying the number of segments by the number of miles each segment represents:
\[ 13.5 \times 8 = 108 \]

Therefore, the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest is 108 miles.

To find the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest, we need to use the scale provided: 1/4 inch on the map equals 8 miles in reality. The distance on the map between Pence and Hillcrest is 3 3/8 inches.

First, let's convert the mixed number 3 3/8 to an improper fraction:
\[ 3 \frac{3}{8} = \frac{31}{8} \]

Now, since 1/4 inch on the map corresponds to 8 miles, we can set up a proportion to find out how many miles 3 3/8 inches on the map correspond to:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \text{ inch} : 8 \text{ miles} = \frac{31}{8} \text{ inch} : x \text{ miles} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times x = 8 \times \frac{31}{8} \]
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times x = 31 \]
\[ x = 31 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 124 \]

So, the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest is 124 miles.

To find the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest, we first need to determine the scale of the map. Since 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance, we can calculate the distance for 1 inch by multiplying by 8. 

1 inch on the map represents \(8 \times 4 = 32\) miles of actual road distance. 

Next, we need to find out the distance in inches for 3 3/8 inches on the map. Converting 3 3/8 to an improper fraction gives us 27/8 inches. 

The actual distance is then calculated by multiplying the number of inches by the miles per inch: 

\[ \text{Actual distance} = \left( \frac{27}{8} \right) \times 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[ \left( \frac{27}{8} \right) \times 32 = \left( \frac{27}{1} \times \frac{32}{8} \right) = \left( \frac{27 \times 32}{1 \times 8} \right) = \frac{864}{8} = 108 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest is 108 miles.

To find the actual distance between the towns, we need to determine how many 1/4 inch segments are represented by 3 3/8 inches.

1/4 inch = 0.25 inches

We can divide 3 3/8 inches by 0.25 to find the number of 1/4 inch segments:

\( \frac{3\frac{3}{8}}{0.25} \)

Convert 3 3/8 to an improper fraction:

\( 3\frac{3}{8} = \frac{27}{8} \)

\( \frac{\frac{27}{8}}{0.25} = \frac{27}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{27}{2} \)

\( \frac{27}{2} = 13.5 \) inches

Now, multiply the number of 1/4 inch segments by the actual distance represented by 1/4 inch:

\( 13.5 \times 0.25 = 3.375 \) miles

The actual distance between the towns, represented by 3 3/8 inches on the map, is 3.375 miles.

To find the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest, we need to calculate the actual distance represented by 3 3/8 inches on the map, given that 1/4 inch represents 8 miles.

1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles, so:
- 1 inch on the map represents 8 * 4 = 32 miles

3 3/8 inches on the map is the same as 3.375 inches, which is 3 inches and 3/8 of an inch.

3 inches on the map represents:
- 3 inches * 32 miles = 96 miles

3/8 of an inch on the map represents:
- (3/8) inches * 32 miles = 12 miles

Adding these together gives the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest:
- 96 miles + 12 miles = 108 miles

To find the actual distance between Pence and Hillcrest, we need to first understand the scale of the map. The scale is given as 1/4 inch representing 8 miles. 

First, we determine the number of 1/4 inch segments in 3 3/8 inches:

\[ \text{Number of segments} = \frac{3\frac{3}{8}}{1/4} \]

Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:

\[ 3\frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 8 + 3}{8} = \frac{24 + 3}{8} = \frac{27}{8} \]

Now, divide by 1/4:
