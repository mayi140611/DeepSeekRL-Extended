#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To find out Irene's total income, we first need to calculate the income from regular hours and then add the additional income from overtime.

Regular income = Hourly wage * Regular hours
Regular income = $500

Overtime income = Overtime hours * Overtime wage
Overtime hours = 50 - 40
Overtime hours = 10
Overtime wage = $20 / hour
Overtime income = 10 * $20 = $200

Total income = Regular income + Overtime income
Total income = $500 + $200 = $700

Therefore, Irene's total income last week was $700.

To calculate Irene's total income, we first determine her earnings from regular hours and then add her overtime pay.

1. **Earnings from regular hours**:
- Irene works 40 hours a week.
- Her regular hourly rate is $500 / 40 hours = $12.50 per hour.

For 40 hours, her earning is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$12.50/\text{hour} = \$500 \]

2. **Earnings from overtime**:
- Irene worked 50 hours in total.
- Overtime hours are 50 - 40 = 10 hours.
- For each overtime hour, she earns $12.50 + $20 = $32.50 (since she gets an additional $20 for every hour of overtime).

For 10 hours of overtime, her earning is:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} \times \$32.50/\text{hour} = \$325 \]

3. **Total income**:
- Adding her regular earnings and overtime earnings together:
\[ \$500 + \$325 = \$825 \]

Therefore, Irene's total income for the week is \$825.

</reasoning>
<answer>
Total income = Regular hours earnings + Overtime earnings
Total income = $500 + ($325)
Total income = $825

**Reasoning:**
To find Irene's total income, we first need to calculate her earnings for the regular hours worked, then the overtime hours, and finally sum them up.

- Regular earning: 40 hours * $500 = $20,000
- Overtime hours: 50 - 40 = 10 hours
- Overtime earning: 10 hours * $20 = $200

Total income = Regular earning + Overtime earning = $20,000 + $200 = $20,200

**Answer:**
Irene's total income for working 50 hours last week is $20,200.

To calculate Irene's total income, we first need to determine how much she earned for the initial 40 hours and then calculate the overtime pay for the additional hours.

For the initial 40 hours, she earns $500.

For the overtime hours:
- She worked 50 hours in total, so the extra hours worked for overtime are 50-40 = 10 hours.
- She earns an extra $20 for every hour of overtime, so for the 10 overtime hours, she earns 10 * $20 = $200.

Now we add the initial earnings to the overtime earnings to get her total income:
Initial earnings: $500
Overtime earnings: $200

Total income = $500 + $200 = $700

Therefore, Irene's total income for the week is $700.

To calculate Irene's total income, we need to first figure out how much money she earned from regular hours and then add the extra income from overtime.

1. Calculate the regular earnings:
   Regular hours = 40 hours
   Regular pay rate = $500 / 40 hours
   Regular earnings = Regular hours * Regular pay rate
   
2. Calculate the overtime earnings:
   Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours
   Overtime pay rate = $520 / 50 hours (since there is an additional bonus of $20 per hour)
   Overtime earnings = Overtime hours * Overtime pay rate
   
3. Calculate the total income:
   Total income = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   
Now we can calculate these values.
  
   Regular earnings = 40 * $12.50 = $500
   Overtime pay rate = $520 / 50 = $10.40 per hour
   Overtime hours = 50 - 40 = 10
   Overtime earnings = 10 * $10.40 = $104
   Total income = $500 + $104 = $604
  
Therefore, Irene's total income from working 50 hours last week is $604.

To calculate her total income, we first need to determine the amount of overtime hours she worked. This can be found by subtracting 40 from the total number of hours worked.

Overtime hours = Total hours worked - 40 hours
Overtime hours = 50 hours - 40 hours
Overtime hours = 10 hours

Next, we calculate the extra income she earned from the overtime hours. This can be found by multiplying the number of overtime hours by the extra money earned per hour.

Extra income from overtime = Overtime hours × Extra money per hour
Extra income from overtime = 10 hours × $20
Extra income from overtime = $200

Now, we can calculate her total income by adding the base pay to the extra income earned from overtime.

Total income = Base pay + Extra income from overtime
Total income = $500 + $200
Total income = $700

Therefore, her total income for the week was $700.

To calculate Irene's total income for working 50 hours last week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

First, calculate the total earnings for the regular hours:
- Irene gets $500 for 40 hours of work. So, the hourly rate for regular hours is $500 / 40 hours = $12.50 per hour.

Now, calculate the total earnings for overtime hours:
- Irene worked 50 hours in total, and since she worked 40 hours at her regular hourly rate, the remaining 10 hours are overtime. She earns an extra $20 for each hour of overtime. Therefore, her overtime pay is 10 hours * $20/hour = $200.

Finally, add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find the total income:
- Regular earnings = $500
- Overtime earnings = $200
- Total earnings = $500 + $200 = $700

So, Irene's total income for working 50 hours last week is $700.

To calculate Irene's total income, we can break it down into two parts: her regular pay and her overtime pay.

First, we'll calculate her regular pay, which is her standard wage for the 40 hours she worked. She earns $500 for 40 hours.

For the 10 extra hours of the week (50 hours total - 40 hours = 10 hours), she receives an extra $20 per hour for overtime. 

We can calculate the overtime pay by multiplying the extra hours by the overtime rate:

Overtime pay = Extra hours worked × Overtime rate
Overtime pay = 10 hours × $20/hour = $200

Next, we add the regular pay to the overtime pay to find Irene's total income:
Total income = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Total income = $500 + $200

Total income = $700

Therefore, Irene earned $700 last week.

To calculate Irene's total income, we need to first determine the amount she earned for the normal hours worked and the overtime hours separately, and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the earnings for normal hours (40 hours):
\[ \text{Income for normal hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$500/\text{hour} = \$20,000 \]

2. Calculate the number of overtime hours (worked hours minus normal hours):
\[ \text{Overtime hours} = 50 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

3. Calculate the earnings for overtime hours (each hour pays $20):
\[ \text{Overtime income} = 10 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$200 \]

4. Calculate the total income:
\[ \text{Total income} = \text{Income for normal hours} + \text{Overtime income} = \$20,000 + \$200 = \$20,200 \]

Therefore, Irene's total income for last week was $20,200.

To calculate Irene's total income for working 50 hours last week, we first need to identify the amount she earns for regular hours and the amount for overtime hours.

- Regular hours: 40 hours
- Overtime hours: 50 - 40 = 10 hours

The pay rate for regular hours is $500 / 40 = $12.50 per hour.

For 50 hours of work, we have:
- Additional hours of work = 50 - 40 = 10 hours
- Overtime pay = 10 hours * $20/hour = $200

The total income is calculated as follows:
- For regular hours: 40 hours * $12.50/hour = $500
- For overtime hours: $200

Total Income = $500 + $200 = $700

Therefore, the answer is $700.

To calculate Irene's total income for working 50 hours last week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime.

First, we calculate the regular hours:
\[ \text{Regular hours} = 40 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate the additional hours worked as overtime:
\[ \text{Overtime hours} = 50 \, \text{hours} - 40 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate the income from the regular hours:
\[ \text{Income from regular hours} = 40 \, \text{hours} \times \$500/\text{hour} = \$20,000 \]

Then, we calculate the income from the overtime hours:
\[ \text{Income from overtime hours} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$200 \]

Finally, we add the income from regular hours and overtime hours to find the total income:
\[ \text{Total income} = \$20,000 + \$200 = \$20,200 \]

Therefore, Irene's total income for working 50 hours last week is $20,200.

To calculate Irene's total income, we need to break down her earnings into regular pay and overtime pay.

- Regular pay is calculated for the 40 hours she worked.
- Overtime pay is calculated for the extra hours worked beyond the regular 40 hours.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
Regular pay = Hourly wage * Regular hours
Regular pay = $500 * 40 hours
Regular pay = $20000

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay:
Overtime pay = (Overtime hours * Hourly wage) + (Overtime hours * Overtime rate)
Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours
Overtime hours = 50 hours - 40 hours
Overtime hours = 10 hours

Overtime rate = Overtime pay per hour
Overtime rate = $20

Overtime pay = (Overtime hours * Overtime rate)
Overtime pay = 10 hours * $20
Overtime pay = $200

Finally, let's calculate her total income:
Total income = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Total income = $20000 + $200
Total income = $20200

Therefore, Irene's total income for the week when she worked 50 hours is $20,200.

Let's calculate Irene's total income based on the given information.

1. **Regular Hours Pay**: Irene earns $500 for 40 hours of work.

2. **Overtime Pay**: Overtime hours are calculated as the total hours minus 40.
\[ \text{Overtime Hours} = \text{Total Hours} - \text{Regular Hours} \]
\[ \text{Overtime Hours} = 50 - 40 = 10 \]

3. **Overtime Pay Rate**: Irene earns an extra $20 for each hour of overtime.

4. **Overtime Pay Calculation**: Multiply the number of overtime hours by the overtime pay rate.
\[ \text{Overtime Pay} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Overtime Pay Rate} \]
\[ \text{Overtime Pay} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

5. **Total Income**: Add the regular pay to the overtime pay.
\[ \text{Total Income} = \text{Regular Hours Pay} + \text{Overtime Pay} \]
\[ \text{Total Income} = 500 + 200 = 700 \]

**Final Answer**: Irene's total income for the week is **$700**.

To calculate Irene's total income, we need to separately determine her earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours, then add them together.

First, calculate the regular earnings: 
\[ \text{Regular Earnings} = \text{Regular Hours} \times \text{Pay per Hour} \]
\[ \text{Regular Earnings} = 40\, \text{hours} \times $500/\text{hour} = $20,000 \]

Next, calculate the overtime earnings:
\[ \text{Overtime Hours} = \text{Total Hours} - \text{Regular Hours} \]
\[ \text{Overtime Hours} = 50\, \text{hours} - 40\, \text{hours} = 10\, \text{hours} \]

\[ \text{Overtime Earnings} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Pay per Hour} + \text{Overtime Payment per Hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime Payment per Hour} = $20/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime Earnings} = 10\, \text{hours} \times ($20/\text{hour} + $500/\text{hour}) = 10\, \text{hours} \times $520/\text{hour} = $5,200 \]

Finally, add the regular earnings and overtime earnings to get the total income:
\[ \text{Total Income} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Overtime Earnings} \]
\[ \text{Total Income} = $20,000 + $5,200 = $25,200 \]

So, Irene's total income for the week was $25,200.
