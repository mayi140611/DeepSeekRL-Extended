To calculate the total time it took Fernanda to finish the six audiobooks, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, determine the total length of all the audiobooks combined. Since each audiobook is 30 hours long and there are six audiobooks, we multiply the length of one audiobook by the number of audiobooks:
   \[
   30 \, \text{hours/audiobook} \times 6 \, \text{audiobooks} = 180 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. Next, we need to calculate how much time it takes to listen to all the audiobooks. Since Fernanda listens to 2 hours of an audiobook each day, we divide the total length of all audiobooks by the number of hours she listens each day:
   \[
   180 \, \text{hours} \div 2 \, \text{hours/day} = 90 \, \text{days}
   \]

Therefore, it took Fernanda 90 days to finish all six audiobooks.

To find out the total time it took Fernanda to finish the six audiobooks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total duration of the audiobooks: Since each audiobook is 30 hours long and she purchased six audiobooks, the total duration is \( 30 \text{ hours} \times 6 = 180 \text{ hours} \).

2. Calculate the total listening time: Since she listens to 2 hours of an audiobook each day, the total time she spends listening to the audiobooks is \( 2 \text{ hours/day} \times D \text{ days} \), where \( D \) is the number of days.

3. Since the number of days \( D \) is the same as the number of audiobooks she listened to, we can say that \( D = 6 \).

4. Therefore, the total time she spent listening to the audiobooks is \( 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours} \).

5. The time it takes her to finish the entire set of audiobooks is the total duration minus the total time she spent listening: \( 180 \text{ hours} - 12 \text{ hours} = 168 \text{ hours} \).

To calculate the total time it took Fernanda to finish the six audiobooks, we need to consider the length of each audiobook and the number of days it took her to listen to them.

Each audiobook is 30 hours long. Fernanda listens to 2 hours of an audiobook each day.

First, we calculate the total number of hours in all six audiobooks:
\[ 6 \text{ audiobooks} \times 30 \text{ hours per audiobook} = 180 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we determine how many days it took to listen to all six audiobooks at a rate of 2 hours per day:
\[ 180 \text{ hours} \div 2 \text{ hours per day} = 90 \text{ days} \]

So, it took Fernanda 90 days to finish the six audiobooks.

Fernanda bought six audiobooks, each 30 hours long. Since she listened to 2 hours of an audiobook each day, we need to determine how many days it took her to finish one audiobook first.

To calculate the number of days it takes to finish one audiobook, we divide the total hours by the hours she listened per day:

\[ \text{Days for one audiobook} = \frac{30 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/day}} = 15 \text{ days} \]

Since she has six audiobooks, we need to multiply the number of days it takes to finish one audiobook by the number of audiobooks:

\[ \text{Total days} = 15 \text{ days/audiobook} \times 6 \text{ audiobooks} = 90 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it took Fernanda 90 days to finish the six audiobooks.

To find out how long it took Fernanda to finish the six audiobooks, we need to calculate the total length of the audiobooks and then divide it by the number of hours she listened to each audiobook per day. 

1. Calculate the total length of the audiobooks:
   Each audiobook is 30 hours long, and there are six audiobooks, so:
   \[
   30 \, \text{hours/book} \times 6 \, \text{books} = 180 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. Calculate the total listening time:
   Fernanda listens to 2 hours of an audiobook each day. To find out how many days it took her to listen to all the audiobooks, we divide the total length of all the audiobooks by the daily listening time:
   \[
   180 \, \text{hours} \div 2 \, \text{hours/day} = 90 \, \text{days}
   \]

So, it took Fernanda 90 days to finish the six audiobooks.

To calculate the total time it took Fernanda to finish the six audiobooks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total hours for all audiobooks:**
   Each audiobook is 30 hours long, and there are 6 audiobooks.
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 30 \text{ hours/book} \times 6 \text{ books} = 180 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the daily listening time:**
   Fernanda listens to 2 hours of an audiobook each day.

3. **Calculate the total days it took to listen to all audiobooks:**
   To find out how many days it takes to listen to 180 hours if she listens 2 hours a day, we divide the total hours by the daily listening time.
   \[
   \text{Total days} = \frac{180 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/day}} = 90 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time to listen to all audiobooks:**
   Multiply the total days by the number of hours she listens each day.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 90 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 180 \text{ hours}

To calculate the total time it took Fernanda to finish the six audiobooks, we need to determine the total listening time for all audios combined.

Each audiobook is 30 hours long, and Fernanda listened to 2 hours of an audiobook each day. Therefore, to find out how many days it would take to finish one audiobook, we divide the total hours of each audiobook by the hours she listens to each day:

\[ \text{Days to finish one audiobook} = \frac{30 \, \text{hours}}{2 \, \text{hours/day}} = 15 \, \text{days} \]

Since Fernanda purchased six audiobooks, and each takes 15 days to complete, the total time to finish all six audiobooks is:

\[ \text{Total days for 6 audiobooks} = 6 \, \text{audiobooks} \times 15 \, \text{days/audiobook} = 90 \, \text{days} \]

Thus, it took her 90 days to finish all six audiobooks.

To determine the total time it took Fernanda to finish six audiobooks, we need to consider both the duration of each audiobook and the daily listening time.

Each audiobook is 30 hours long, and Fernanda listened to 2 hours of an audiobook each day.

First, let's calculate the total time required to listen to one audiobook:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time required for six audiobooks:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times 6 = 180 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it would take to listen to all six audiobooks if she listens 2 hours each day. We do this by dividing the total hours by the number of hours she listens per day:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/day}} = 90 \text{ days} \]

So, it took Fernanda 90 days to finish all six audiobooks.

To determine the total time it took Fernanda to finish the six audiobooks, we first need to calculate the total duration of the audiobooks in hours. Since each audiobook is 30 hours long and there are six audiobooks, the total duration is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) hours. 

Next, since she listens to 2 hours of an audiobook each day, she completes \(2\) hours/day \(\times\) \(D\) days = \(180\) hours. To find \(D\), we divide the total hours by the hours she listens per day: \(180 / 2 = 90\) days.

Therefore, it took Fernanda 90 days to finish the six audiobooks.
