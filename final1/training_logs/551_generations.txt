To find out how many cars can be parked in the parking lot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total area of the parking lot.
2. Determine the useable area for parking by taking 80% of the total area.
3. Calculate how many cars can be parked in that area, given that each car takes up 10 square feet.

Let's start with the total area of the parking lot:
\[ \text{Total area} = 400 \text{ feet} \times 500 \text{ feet} = 200,000 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we find the useable area for parking by taking 80% of the total area:
\[ \text{Useable area} = 200,000 \text{ square feet} \times 0.80 = 160,000 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we calculate how many cars can be parked in this area. Since each car requires 10 square feet:
\[ \text{Number of cars} = \frac{160,000 \text{ square feet}}{10 \text{ square feet per car}} = 16,000 \text{ cars} \]

So, the number of cars that can be parked is:
\[ \boxed{16000} \]

To determine how many cars can be parked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total area of the parking lot.
2. Determine the usable area for parking.
3. Finally, calculate how many cars can be parked based on the available area and the size of a car's parking space.

### Step 1: Calculate the total area of the parking lot
The parking lot is 400 feet by 500 feet. The total area \( A \) is given by:
\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 400 \text{ feet} \times 500 \text{ feet} = 200,000 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the usable area for parking
80% of the total area is useable for parking. Therefore, the usable area \( A_{\text{usable}} \) is:
\[
A_{\text{usable}} = 0.80 \times 200,000 \text{ square feet} = 160,000 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many cars can be parked
Each car requires 10 square feet of parking space. So, the number of cars \( N \) that can be parked is:
\[
N = \frac{A_{\text{usable}}}{10 \text{ square feet per car}} = \frac{160,000 \text{ square feet}}{10 \text{ square feet per car}} = 16,000
\]

Thus, the number of cars that can be parked is:

To calculate the total area available for parking, we need to multiply the length by the width of the parking lot. 
The total area is 400 feet * 500 feet = 200,000 square feet. 
Only 80% of that area is useable, so we multiply 200,000 by 0.8 to get the usable area: 200,000 * 0.8 = 160,000 square feet. 
Since it takes 10 square feet to park a car, we divide 160,000 by 10 to find out how many cars can be parked: 160,000 / 10 = 16,000 cars. 
Therefore, there can be 16,000 cars parked in the parking lot.

First, we need to calculate the total area of the parking lot. The area is given by the product of the length and the width:

\[
\text{Total Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 400 \text{ feet} \times 500 \text{ feet} = 200,000 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we determine the useable area for parking, which is 80% of the total area:

\[
\text{Useable Area} = 0.80 \times \text{Total Area} = 0.80 \times 200,000 \text{ square feet} = 160,000 \text{ square feet}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many cars can be parked in this useable area. We know that each car requires 10 square feet of space:

\[
\text{Number of Cars} = \frac{\text{Useable Area}}{\text{Space per Car}} = \frac{160,000 \text{ square feet}}{10 \text{ square feet per car}} = 16,000 \text{ cars}
\]

So, the number of cars that can be parked is \( 16,000 \).

The total area of the parking lot is \(400 \times 500 = 200,000\) square feet. Only 80% of this area is usable for parking, so the usable area is \(200,000 \times 0.8 = 160,000\) square feet. Since it takes 10 square feet to park a car, the number of cars that can be parked is \(160,000 / 10 = 16,000\) cars.

To calculate the number of cars that can be parked, we first need to calculate the total area of the parking lot and then find out what percentage of that area is usable for parking.

Total area of the parking lot = length × width
Total area = 400 feet × 500 feet = 200,000 square feet

The usable area is 80% of the total area.

Usable area = Total area × 80%
Usable area = 200,000 sq ft × 0.8 = 160,000 sq ft

Now we know that it takes 10 square feet to park a car. 

Number of cars that can be parked = Usable area / Area per car
Number of cars = 160,000 sq ft / 10 sq ft/car = 16,000 cars

First, we need to calculate the total area of the parking lot. The area is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

So the total area of the parking lot is:

\[ \text{Area} = 400 \times 500 = 200,000 \text{ square feet} \]

Since only 80% of the area is useable for parking, the available area is:

\[ \text{Useable Area} = 200,000 \times 0.80 = 160,000 \text{ square feet} \]

Given that it takes 10 square feet to park a car, the number of cars that can be parked is:

\[ \text{Number of Cars} = \frac{\text{Useable Area}}{\text{Area per Car}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Cars} = \frac{160,000}{10} = 16,000 \]

So, 16,000 cars can be parked.

To calculate how many cars can be parked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total area of the parking lot.
2. Determine 80% of that area, as it's usable for parking.
3. Divide that area by the number of square feet it takes to park one car.

Let's calculate:

1. Area of the parking lot:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 400\, \text{feet} \times 500\, \text{feet} \]

So, the area is:
\[ 400 \times 500 = 200,000\, \text{square feet} \]

2. Usable area for parking (80% of total area):
\[ \text{Usable Area} = 0.80 \times \text{Area} \]

So, the usable area is:
\[ 0.80 \times 200,000 = 160,000\, \text{square feet} \]

3. Calculate the number of cars that can be parked:
\[ \text{Number of Cars} = \frac{\text{Usable Area}}{\text{Area per Car}} \]

So, the number of cars is:
\[ \frac{160,000}{10} = 16,000 \]

Therefore, James can park 16,000 cars.
