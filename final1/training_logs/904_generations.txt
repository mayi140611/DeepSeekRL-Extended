To calculate the total money John makes, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 12 hours and the remaining 14 hours.

For the first 12 hours, John generates $5000 per hour. So, his earnings for the first 12 hours are:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times \$5000 = \$60,000 \]

For the remaining 14 hours, he generates 20% more per hour than $5000. First, we calculate 20% of $5000:
\[ 20\% \times \$5000 = \$1000 \]

Adding this to his original hourly rate gives him:
\[ \$5000 + \$1000 = \$6000 \]

So, his earnings for the remaining 14 hours are:
\[ 14 \text{ hours} \times \$6000 = \$84,000 \]

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both parts:
\[ \$60,000 + \$84,000 = \$144,000 \]

Therefore, John makes a total of \$144,000.

To calculate the total money John makes, we need to consider the amount he generates per hour for the first 12 hours and the amount for the remaining 14 hours.

For the first 12 hours, he generates $5000 per hour. So, for the first 12 hours, the total amount generated is 12 * $5000 = $60,000.

For the remaining 14 hours, he generates 20% more per hour. So, the amount per hour for these 14 hours is $5000 + (20/100) * $5000 = $5000 + $1000 = $6000 per hour.

So, for the remaining 14 hours, the total amount generated is 14 * $6000 = $84,000.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total money generated:
$60,000 + $84,000 = $144,000.

Therefore, John makes a total of $144,000 from the telethon.

First, we need to calculate the money John generates for the first 12 hours. At $5000 per hour, the total for these 12 hours is $5000 * 12 = $60000.

Next, we need to calculate the rate for the remaining 14 hours. The problem states that he generates 20% more per hour than before. Since he was generating $5000 per hour, this equates to an increase of 0.2 * $5000 = $1000 per hour. Therefore, the new rate is $5000 + $1000 = $6000 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much he makes for the remaining 14 hours. At the new rate, this is $6000 * 14 = $84000.

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money John makes by adding the money generated in the first 12 hours to the money generated in the remaining 14 hours. So, the total is $60000 + $84000 = $144000.

To calculate the total money John makes from the telethon, we can break it down into two parts:

1. Calculate the money generated for the first 12 hours.
2. Calculate the money generated for the remaining 14 hours.

First, we will calculate the money generated for the first 12 hours:
\[ \text{Money generated in first 12 hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 5000 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, for the remaining 14 hours, John generates 20% more per hour. So, his hourly rate for the last part is:
\[ 5000 \text{ dollars/hour} + (0.20 \times 5000 \text{ dollars/hour}) = 5000 \text{ dollars/hour} + 1000 \text{ dollars/hour} = 6000 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Now, we calculate the money generated for the remaining 14 hours:
\[ \text{Money generated in last 14 hours} = 14 \text{ hours} \times 6000 \text{ dollars/hour} = 84000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the money generated from both parts:
\[ \text{Total money} = 60000 \text{ dollars} + 84000 \text{ dollars} = 144000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total money John makes from the telethon is $144,000.

To find out how much money John makes in total, we need to calculate the money he generates for each part of the telethon and then add them together.

For the first 12 hours, John generates $5000 per hour. So, the total amount for these hours is:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times \$5000/\text{hour} = \$60,000 \]

For the remaining 14 hours, he generates 20% more per hour than before. The increase in money generated per hour is:
\[ 14 \text{ hours} \times (\text{original income per hour} + 0.20 \times \text{original income per hour}) \]
\[ 14 \text{ hours} \times ( \$5000 + 0.20 \times \$5000 ) \]
\[ 14 \text{ hours} \times ( \$5000 + \$1000 ) \]
\[ 14 \text{ hours} \times \$6000 \]
\[ \$84,000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both parts of the telethon:
\[ \$60,000 + \$84,000 = \$144,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John makes from the telethon is \$144,000.

For the first 12 hours, he generates $5000 per hour. So the total money generated in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 5000 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 60000 \text{ dollars} \]

For the remaining 14 hours, he generates 20% more per hour. So for each of these hours, he generates:
\[ 5000 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 1.20 = 6000 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

The total money generated in the remaining 14 hours is:
\[ 6000 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 14 \text{ hours} = 84000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total money generated in the entire telethon, we add the money generated in the first 12 hours to the money generated in the remaining 14 hours:
\[ 60000 \text{ dollars} + 84000 \text{ dollars} = 144000 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ 14 \times (5000 + 1000) = 14 \times 6000 = 84000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both parts to get the total amount John makes:

To calculate the total money generated, let's break it down into the two parts: the first 12 hours and the remaining 14 hours.

1. For the first 12 hours:
   - John generates $5000 per hour.
   - Time period: 12 hours.
   - Total money for the first part: \( 12 \times 5000 \) = $60,000.

2. For the remaining 14 hours:
   - John generates 20% more per hour compared to the first 12 hours.
   - The additional money per hour in the second part is \( 5000 \times 0.20 \) = $1000 per hour.
   - Time period: 14 hours.
   - Total money for the second part: \( 14 \times (5000 + 1000) \) = \( 14 \times 6000 \) = $84,000.

3. To find the total money generated:
   - Total money = Money from first part + Money from second part = $60,000 + $84,000 = $144,000.

Therefore, the total money generated is $144,000.

John's performance during the first 12 hours is straightforward. He generates $5000 per hour for 12 hours, so the total for those 12 hours is:
\[ 12 \times \$5000 = \$60000 \]

For the remaining 14 hours, he generates 20% more per hour than he did during the first 12 hours. To find out how much he generates per hour during the last 14 hours, we calculate the rate for the remaining hours:
\[ \$5000 + 0.20 \times \$5000 = \$6000 \]

Now, to find the total generated during the last 14 hours, we multiple the hourly rate by the number of hours:
\[ 14 \times \$6000 = \$84000 \]

To find the total money raised from the telethon, we add the money made in the first 12 hours to that of the last 14 hours:
\[ \$60000 + \$84000 = \$144000 \]

Therefore, John raises a total of $144000 from the telethon.

To calculate the total money John makes, we need to divide the total time of the telethon into two parts: the first 12 hours and the remaining 14 hours. 

First, we'll calculate the income for the first 12 hours:
\[ \text{Income}_{12} = 12 \, \text{hours} \times \$5000/\text{hour} \]

Next, we'll calculate the income for the remaining 14 hours, which is 20% more than the regular rate per hour:
\[ \text{Income}_{14} = (1 + 20\%) \times \text{Income}_{12} \]

Now we'll calculate the total income:
\[ \text{Total Income} = \text{Income}_{12} + \text{Income}_{14} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ \text{Income}_{12} = 12 \times \$5000 = \$60,000 \]
\[ \text{Income}_{14} = 1.20 \times \$60,000 = \$72,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Income} = \$60,000 + \$72,000 = \$132,000 \]

Therefore, John makes a total of \$132,000.

To determine the total amount of money John raises, we need to calculate the earnings for each part of the telethon separately and then sum them up.

For the first 12 hours:
John earns $5000 per hour. Therefore, for the first 12 hours, the earnings are \( 12 \times 5000 = 60000 \) dollars.

For the remaining 14 hours:
John earns 20% more per hour than the first 12 hours. This means his hourly earnings increase by \( 5000 \times 0.20 = 1000 \) dollars. Therefore, his new hourly rate is \( 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \) dollars per hour. For the remaining 14 hours, the earnings are \( 14 \times 6000 = 84000 \) dollars.

Thus, the total earnings from both parts of the telethon are:
\( 60000 + 84000 = 144000 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the amount of money he makes in the remaining 14 hours. He generates 20% more per hour than the initial rate of $5000, which means he makes:

To determine the total amount of money John makes, we need to calculate the earnings for the first 12 hours and the remaining 14 hours separately, and then sum them up.

For the first 12 hours, John generates $5000 per hour:
Total earnings for the first 12 hours = $5000/hour * 12 hours = $60000

For the remaining 14 hours, he generates 20% more per hour. To find out the increased rate, we calculate 20% of $5000:
Increase in rate = 20% * $5000 = 0.20 * $5000 = $1000

So, his earnings per hour for the remaining 14 hours are:
New rate = $5000 + $1000 = $6000

Total earnings for the remaining 14 hours = $6000/hour * 14 hours = $84000

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to get the total earnings:
Total earnings = Earnings for the first 12 hours + Earnings for the remaining 14 hours
Total earnings = $60000 + $84000 = $144000

Therefore, the total money John makes is $144000.
