system
Tim has 30 less apples than Martha, and Martha has 68 apples. To find out how many apples Tim has, we subtract 30 from the number of apples Martha has:

68 - 30 = 38

So, Tim has 38 apples.

Harry has half as many apples as Tim, so we divide the number of apples Tim has by 2:

38 / 2 = 19

Therefore, Harry has 19 apples.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. **Determine how many apples Tim has:**
   - We know that Tim has 30 less apples than Martha.
   - Martha has 68 apples.
   - Therefore, \( \text{Tim's apples} = \text{Martha's apples} - 30 \)
   - Substituting the number of apples Martha has into the equation: \( \text{Tim's apples} = 68 - 30 \)
   - Calculation: \( \text{Tim's apples} = 38 \)

2. **Determine how many apples Harry has:**
   - Harry has half as many apples as Tim.
   - Therefore, \( \text{Harry's apples} = \frac{\text{Tim's apples}}{2} \)
   - Substituting the number of apples Tim has into the equation: \( \text{Harry's apples} = \frac{38}{2} \)
   - Calculation: \( \text{Harry's apples} = 19 \)

Therefore, Harry has 19 apples.

To determine how many apples Harry has, we start by identifying how many apples Tim and Harry have based on the information given.

First, we know that Martha has 68 apples.
Tim has 30 less apples than Martha. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples Tim has by subtracting 30 from the number of apples Martha has:
\[ \text{Number of apples Tim has} = 68 - 30 = 38 \]

Next, we know that Harry has half as many apples as Tim. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples Harry has by dividing the number of apples Tim has by 2:
\[ \text{Number of apples Harry has} = \frac{38}{2} = 19 \]

Thus, the number of apples Harry has is \boxed{19}.

To find out how many apples Harry has, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many apples Tim has. Since Tim has 30 less apples than Martha, we can calculate this by subtracting 30 from the number of apples Martha has:
   Tim's apples = Martha's apples - 30
   Tim's apples = 68 - 30
   Tim's apples = 38

2. Next, we need to find out how many apples Harry has. According to the information given, Harry has half as many apples as Tim:
   Harry's apples = Tim's apples / 2
   Harry's apples = 38 / 2
   Harry's apples = 19

Therefore, Harry has 19 apples.

Reasoning:
Let's denote the number of apples Martha has as \( M \), the number of apples Tim has as \( T \), and the number of apples Harry has as \( H \).

From the problem statement, we know:
1. Tim has 30 less apples than Martha: \( T = M - 30 \)
2. Martha has 68 apples: \( M = 68 \)
3. Harry has half as many apples as Tim: \( H = \frac{1}{2} \times T \)

First, we can use the first piece of information to find the number of apples Tim has:
\[ T = M - 30 \]
\[ T = 68 - 30 \]
\[ T = 38 \]

Now, we can use the information about Harry to find out how many apples he has:
\[ H = \frac{1}{2} \times T \]
\[ H = \frac{1}{2} \times 38 \]
\[ H = 19 \]

Therefore, Harry has 19 apples.

Answer:
Harry has 19 apples.

To determine how many apples Harry has, we need to find out the number of apples Tim has first, and then use that information to find the number of apples Harry has.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples Tim has.
Martha has 68 apples, and Tim has 30 less apples than Martha.
\[ \text{Tim's apples} = \text{Martha's apples} - 30 \]
\[ \text{Tim's apples} = 68 - 30 = 38 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples Harry has.
Harry has half as many apples as Tim.
\[ \text{Harry's apples} = \frac{\text{Tim's apples}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Harry's apples} = \frac{38}{2} = 19 \]

Therefore, Harry has 19 apples.

To determine how many apples Harry has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples Tim has.
2. Use Tim's number of apples to find out how many Harry has.

First, we know that Martha has 68 apples. Tim has 30 less apples than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Tim has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of apples Tim has} = 68 - 30 = 38
\]

Next, we know that Harry has half as many apples as Tim. So, we can calculate the number of apples Harry has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of apples Harry has} = \frac{38}{2} = 19
\]

Thus, the number of apples Harry has is \(\boxed{19}\).

To find out how many apples Harry has, we need to first determine how many apples Tim has. Since Tim has 30 less apples than Martha, we can find the number of apples that Tim has by subtracting 30 from the number of apples Martha has: 

\[ \text{Tim's apples} = \text{Martha's apples} - 30 \]

\[ \text{Tim's apples} = 68 - 30 = 38 \]

Now we know Tim has 38 apples. Since Harry has half as many apples as Tim, we will find out how many apples Harry has by dividing Tim's total by 2: 

\[ \text{Harry's apples} = \frac{\text{Tim's apples}}{2} \]

\[ \text{Harry's apples} = \frac{38}{2} = 19 \]

So, Harry has 19 apples.
