#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
Travis and his brother together collected 68 pieces of candy. Each of them ate 4 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces each ate together is 4 + 4 = 8. To find out how many pieces of candy were left, we subtract the total amount eaten from the total collected. The calculation is 68 - 8 = 60.

<reasoning>
To determine how many pieces of candy were left, we need to account for the candy that each of them ate after the event. Since Travis and his brother each ate 4 pieces of candy, together they ate \(4 + 4 = 8\) pieces of candy. Given that they initially collected 68 pieces of candy, we can find out how many pieces were left by subtracting the total amount of candy eaten from the initial amount. So, the calculation would be \(68 - 8 = 60\) pieces of candy remaining.

<reasoning>
To find out how many pieces of candy were left, we first need to determine how many pieces of candy Travis and his brother ate in total. Since each of them ate 4 pieces of candy, the total amount of candy they ate is 4 pieces/person * 2 people = 8 pieces.
Therefore, to find out how many pieces of candy were left, we need to subtract the total amount of candy they ate from the total amount of candy they collected. The total amount of candy they collected is 68 pieces, and they ate 8 pieces, so the number of pieces left is 68 pieces - 8 pieces = 60 pieces.

Let's begin by subtracting the candies each of them ate from the total candies collected. 

Total candies collected: 68
Candies eaten by Travis: 4
Candies eaten by his brother: 4

So, the total candies eaten by both brothers are 4 + 4 = 8.

Now, subtract the total candies eaten by both brothers from the total candies collected:

Candies left = Total candies collected - Total candies eaten
Candies left = 68 - 8
Candies left = 60

Therefore, 60 pieces of candy were left.

First, we need to determine how many pieces of candy Travis and his brother collectively ate. Each ate 4 pieces of candy, so together they ate \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) pieces of candy.

The total number of candies they collected initially was 68, and 8 of those were eaten. Therefore, the number of candies left is \( 68 - 8 = 60 \).

Finally, we need to account for the candy Travis and his brother each ate, which is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) pieces. Subtracting this from the candies left, the number of candies left after both ate theirs is \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).

To determine how many pieces of candy were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candies eaten by both Travis and his brother.
2. Subtract the total number of candies eaten from the initial total number of candies.

Step 1: Each of them ate 4 pieces of candy. Since there are two of them, the total number of candies eaten is:
\[ 4 \text{ candies/brother} \times 2 \text{ brothers} = 8 \text{ candies} \]

Step 2: Subtract the total number of candies eaten from the initial total number of candies:
\[ 68 \text{ candies} - 8 \text{ candies} = 60 \text{ candies} \]

Thus, the number of candies left is 60.

Each of Travis and his brother ate 4 pieces of candy, so together they ate \(4 + 4 = 8\) pieces. Starting with 68 pieces, and eating 8 after the event, the number of pieces left would be \(68 - 8\).

\[68 - 8 = 60 \]

So, the total number of candies left is 60 pieces.

To determine how many pieces of candy were left after Travis and his brother ate some, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total pieces of candy eaten by both Travis and his brother:**
   Each of them ate 4 pieces of candy. Therefore, together they ate:
   \[
   4 + 4 = 8 \text{ pieces of candy}
   \]

2. **Subtract the total pieces of candy eaten from the original amount collected:**
   Originally, they collected 68 pieces of candy. After eating 8 pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   68 - 8 = 60 \text{ pieces of candy}
   \]

Thus, the number of pieces of candy left is 60.

To determine how many pieces of candy were left after Travis and his brother ate some, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much candy was eaten in total. Since each of them ate 4 pieces and there are two of them, we can multiply the number of pieces each ate by the number of people:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/person} \times 2 \text{ people} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

2. Subtract the total number of pieces eaten from the original amount of candy. The original amount was 68 pieces:
\[ 68 \text{ pieces} - 8 \text{ pieces} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

So, 60 pieces of candy were left.

2. Subtract the total number of candies eaten from the total number of candies collected.

First, we calculate the total number of candies eaten by each of them. Both went through this activity and ate 4 pieces each:
\[
4 \text{ candies/trick-or-treat} \times 2 \text{ people} = 8 \text{ candies}
\]

Next, we subtract the candies eaten from the total candies collected:
\[
68 \text{ candies} - 8 \text{ candies} = 60 \text{ candies}

To determine how many pieces of candy Travis and his brother have left after eating 4 pieces each, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candy pieces they ate together.
   Each of them ate 4 pieces, so together they ate \(4 + 4 = 8\) pieces.

2. Subtract the number of pieces they ate from the total number of pieces they initially had.
   Travis and his brother initially had 68 pieces, so after eating, they have \(68 - 8 = 60\) pieces left.

3. The remaining number of pieces is the final answer.

To determine how many pieces of candy were left after Travis and his brother ate some, we start by calculating the total amount of candy they ate together. Each of them ate 4 pieces, and there are two of them.

So, the total amount of candy eaten is:
\[ 4 \, \text{pieces/brother} \times 2 \, \text{brothers} = 8 \, \text{pieces} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount of candy eaten from the original total amount of candy collected:
\[ 68 \, \text{pieces} - 8 \, \text{pieces} = 60 \, \text{pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of candy left is 60.
