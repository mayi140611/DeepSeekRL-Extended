<reasoning>
Jasmine's shoe size is given as 7. Alexa's shoe size is twice that of Jasmine's, so Alexa's shoe size is \(2 \times 7 = 14\). To find the combined shoe size, we add Jasmine's shoe size and Alexa's shoe size together.

Jasmine's shoe size: 7
Alexa's shoe size: 14

Combined shoe size: \(7 + 14 = 21\).

Therefore, the combined shoe size is 21.

To find the combined shoe size for both Jasmine and her sister Alexa, we first need to determine Alexa's shoe size. Since Alexa's shoes are twice as big as Jasmine's shoes, we can calculate Alexa's shoe size as follows:

\[ \text{Alexa's shoe size} = 2 \times \text{Jasmine's shoe size} \]
\[ \text{Alexa's shoe size} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now that we have both sizes, we can add them together to find the combined shoe size:

\[ \text{Combined shoe size} = \text{Jasmine's shoe size} + \text{Alexa's shoe size} \]
\[ \text{Combined shoe size} = 7 + 14 = 21 \]

So, the combined shoe size for both Jasmine and Alexa is 21.

To find the combined shoe size for both Jasmine and Alexa, we first need to determine Alexa's shoe size. Given that Alexa's shoe size is twice Jasmine's shoe size and Jasmine's shoe size is 7, we multiply Jasmine's size by 2:

\[ \text{Alexa's size} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now we can find the combined shoe size by adding Jasmine's shoe size (7) and Alexa's shoe size (14):

\[ \text{Combined shoe size} = 7 + 14 = 21 \]

So, the combined shoe size for both Jasmine and Alexa is 21.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the shoe sizes. Alexa's shoe size is twice that of Jasmine's shoe size.

Jasmine's shoe size is given as 7.

To find Alexa's shoe size, we multiply Jasmine's shoe size by 2:
\[ \text{Alexa's shoe size} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, to find the combined shoe size for both of them, we add their shoe sizes together:
\[ \text{Combined shoe size} = \text{Jasmine's shoe size} + \text{Alexa's shoe size} \]
\[ = 7 + 14 = 21 \]

So, the combined shoe size for Jasmine and Alexa is 21.

First, we need to understand the relationship between Alexa's shoe size and Jasmine's shoe size. The problem states that Alexa's shoes are twice as big as Jasmine's shoes. If Jasmine's shoe size is 7, then Alexa's shoe size would be \(2 \times 7 = 14\).

Next, we add Jasmine's shoe size to Alexa's shoe size to find the combined shoe size:

\[ \text{Jasmine's shoe size} + \text{Alexa's shoe size} = 7 + 14 = 21 \]

Therefore, the combined shoe size for both of them is 21.

Reasoning:
1. We know that Alexa's shoe size is twice Jasmine's shoe size.
2. Jasmine's shoe size is given as 7.
3. Therefore, Alexa's shoe size would be 2 * 7 = 14.
4. To find the combined shoe size, we add Jasmine's shoe size to Alexa's shoe size: 7 + 14 = 21.

Let's calculate the shoe size for Alexa first. Since Alexa's shoe size is twice Jasmine's, and Jasmine's shoe size is 7, we multiply 7 by 2:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

So, Alexa's shoe size is 14.

To find the combined shoe size for both of them, we add Jasmine's shoe size to Alexa's shoe size:

\[ 7 + 14 = 21 \]

Therefore, the combined shoe size for both Jasmine and Alexa is 21.

To find the combined shoe size for Jasmine and Alexa, we first determine Alexa's shoe size based on the given information. Alexa's shoes are twice as big as Jasmine's, and Jasmine's shoe size is 7.

Alexa's shoe size = 2 * Jasmine's shoe size
Alexa's shoe size = 2 * 7
Alexa's shoe size = 14

Now, we add Jasmine's and Alexa's shoe sizes to get the combined shoe size:

Combined shoe size = Jasmine's shoe size + Alexa's shoe size
Combined shoe size = 7 + 14
Combined shoe size = 21

Therefore, the combined shoe size for both of them is 21.
