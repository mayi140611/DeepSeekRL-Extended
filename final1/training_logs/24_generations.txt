system
Initially, Mary spent the full credit limit, which is $100. She paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. Let's calculate the total amount she has already paid:

\[15 + 23 = 38\]

Now, let's determine how much credit is still left to be paid:

\[100 - 38 = 62\]

Therefore, Mary will need to pay $62 before her next shopping trip.

To determine how much credit Mary needs to pay before her next shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount spent by Mary in this week.
2. Subtract the amounts paid on Tuesday and Thursday to find out the remaining balance.

Total amount spent = $15 + $23 = $38
Remaining balance after payments = $100 - $38 = $62

Therefore, the amount Mary needs to pay before her next shopping trip is $62.

Reasoning:

Mary started with a $100 credit limit. She paid off $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. To find out how much she still owes, we subtract the amount she paid from the total credit limit:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 100 - (15 + 23) = 100 - 38 = 62 \]

So, Mary needs to pay $62 before her next shopping trip.

Mary needs to pay $62 before her next shopping trip.

To determine how much credit Mary needs to pay before her next shopping trip, we need to calculate two things: 
1. The total amount of credit she has already spent
2. The total amount she needs to pay

First, let's find the total amount of credit she has already spent. This includes the full credit limit of $100, the $15 she paid on Tuesday, and the $23 she paid on Thursday. We add these amounts together:

$100 (full credit limit) + $15 (Tuesday payment) + $23 (Thursday payment) = $138

Next, we need to determine how much credit she still has to pay. We subtract the total amount she has already paid ($138) from the full credit limit ($100):

$100 (full credit limit) - $138 (total paid) = -$38

Mary has a debt of $38, which means she needs to pay an additional $38 before her next shopping trip. Therefore, the amount of credit Mary needs to pay before her next shopping trip is $38.

$38

The total credit card balance after her purchases is the initial credit limit minus what she's paid. So:
\[ \text{Remaining balance} = \$100 - \$15 - \$23. \]
\[ \text{Remaining balance} = \$100 - \$15 - \$23 = \$62. \]

To determine how much credit Mary still needs to pay before her next shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total credit limit**: Mary has a credit limit of $100.
2. **Determine how much she has already spent**: Mary spent the full credit limit of $100.
3. **Calculate the remaining credit**: Subtract the amount she has paid from the total credit limit.

Now, let's perform the calculations step by step:

- Total credit limit: $100
- Amount paid on Tuesday: $15
- Amount paid on Thursday: $23

First, add the amounts paid on Tuesday and Thursday to find out how much she has paid in total:
\[ 15 + 23 = 38 \]

Next, subtract the total amount paid from the total credit limit to find out how much credit she still needs to pay:
\[ 100 - 38 = 62 \]

Therefore, Mary will need to pay \(\boxed{62}\) dollars before her next shopping trip.

To determine how much credit Mary needs to pay before her next shopping trip, we first need to calculate the total amount of the credit and the amounts she has already paid.

1. **Initial Credit Limit**: $100
2. **Amount Paid on Tuesday**: $15
3. **Amount Paid on Thursday**: $23

First, let's add the amounts she has already paid:

Reasoning:

Mary initially had a credit of $100 and spent it all that week. She then paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. The total amount she paid was $15 + $23 = $38. Since she spent the full credit limit, she needs to pay the remaining amount, which is $100 - $38 = $62 before her next shopping trip.

Mary will need to pay $62 before her next shopping trip.

To determine how much credit Mary needs to pay before her next shopping trip, we need to first calculate the remaining balance she owes after her previous payments.

1. **Initial Credit Balance**: Mary started with $100.
2. **Payment on Tuesday**: She paid $15 of the balance.
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance after Tuesday} = 100 - 15 = 85
   \]
3. **Payment on Thursday**: She paid $23 of the remaining balance.
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance after Thursday} = 85 - 23 = 62

So, before her next shopping trip, Mary needs to pay $62.
