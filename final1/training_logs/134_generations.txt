To determine how much change the couple will receive, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

1. **Children's Ticket Discount**:
   - The regular ticket costs $109.
   - Children below 12 years old receive a $5 discount.
   - Therefore, the cost for each child's ticket is $109 - $5 = $104.

2. **Total Ticket Cost for the Couple**:
   - The couple has two children.
   - The total cost for two children's tickets is $104 * 2 = $208.

3. **Total Cost for Both Adults**:
   - Let's assume the adult ticket cost is the same as the regular ticket price, which is $109.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the couple is $109 * 2 = $218.

4. **Total Cost for All Tickets**:
   - The total cost for the couple and both children is $208 + $218 = $426.

5. **Change Calculation**:
   - They gave the cashier $500.
   - The change they will receive is $500 - $426 = $74.

**Conclusion**:
The couple will receive $74 in change from the cashier.

To determine the change the couple will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract it from the amount given by the cashier.

First, calculate the total ticket cost for the two children. The regular ticket cost is $109, but children below 12 years old have a $5 discount. Therefore, each child's ticket cost is:
\[ 109 - 5 = 104 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are two children, the total ticket cost for both children is:
\[ 104 \times 2 = 208 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, add the cost of the adult ticket. The adult ticket costs $109.
\[ 208 + 109 = 317 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the tickets is $317. The couple gave the cashier $500. To find the change, subtract the total ticket cost from the amount given:
\[ 500 - 317 = 183 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the couple will receive \(\boxed{183}\) dollars in change.

The children's tickets cost $109 x 2 = $218. The discount on the regular price of 2 tickets is $5 x 2 = $10. So the total price of the tickets is $218 - $10 = $208. Thus, they will receive $500 - $208 = $292 in change.

To calculate the total cost for the family, we need to determine the cost for the adult tickets and the children's tickets.

- The first adult ticket costs $109.
- The second adult ticket also costs $109.
- Each child ticket without discount costs $109.

Children should be given a discount of $5 per child. Therefore, the total cost for the children's tickets is 2 children times $109, which gives $218 in total.

So the total discount amount is 2 children times $5, which equals $10.

Now, calculate the total cost:
- Cost for adults: $109 + $109 = $218
- Discount amount for children: $109 x 2 = $218

So the total cost for the family is: $218 + $218 = $436

The amount they want to give the cashier is $500, so the change they should receive is $500 - $436.

Answer:
They will receive $64 in change.

To calculate the change, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets. The regular ticket costs $109, and since both children are under 12, they each receive a $5 discount. 

Cost of one child's ticket = $109 - $5 = $104
Total cost for two children = $104 * 2 = $208

Now we add the cost of one adult ticket, which is $109:

Total cost for two children and one adult = $208 + $109 = $317

If they gave the cashier $500, the change they will receive is:

Change = $500 - $317 = $183

First, let's calculate the discounted ticket cost for the couple and their children. The regular ticket costs $109, but children below 12 have a $5 discount. The youngest child is 6 years old, and the oldest child is 10 years old, so they are eligible for the discount.

The discount for the children is calculated as follows:
The discount per child = $5 (for being below 12 years old)
Since there are two children, the overall discount for both children is:
Total discount = 2 * $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the total ticket cost:
Total ticket cost = $109 (regular price) - $10 (discount) = $99

Since there are three people (the couple and the two children), we need to multiply the total ticket cost by 3:
Total cost for the ticket = $99 * 3 = $297

The couple gave the cashier $500, so the change they should receive is:
Change = $500 - $297 = $203

After the 6-year-old is given a $5 discount, she would end up paying $109 - $5 = $104. The 10-year-old would pay the regular price of $109. Together they would pay $104 + $109 = $213. They would receive $500 - $213 = $287 as change.

To calculate the change they will receive, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets without the discount:
   - Cost for both parents: $109 (each parent) Ã— 2 = $218
   - Cost for the 6-year-old child: $109 (regular price) - $5 (discount) = $104
   - Cost for the 10-year-old child: $109 (regular price) - $5 (discount) = $104
   - Total cost without discount: $218 + $104 + $104 = $426

2. Subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier to find the change:
   - Amount given to cashier: $500
   - Change: $500 - $426 = $74

First, we calculate the cost of each ticket with the discount applied. For the 10-year-old child, the ticket costs $109 - $5 = $104. For the 6-year-old child, the ticket also costs $104 (since age does not make a difference for this discount).

Next, we add the cost of both tickets to find the total cost:
Total cost = $104 (6-year-old ticket) + $104 (10-year-old ticket) = $208.

Now we subtract this total from the amount given to the cashier to find the change:
Change = $500 - $208 = $292.

Therefore, the answer is 292.

Let's break down the ticket costs:
- The 6-year-old child (age 6 to 12) will pay $109 because they are not eligible for the discount.
- The 10-year-old child (age 6 to 12) will pay $109 - $5 = $104 because they are eligible for the discount.

So, the total cost is:
6-year-old child: $109
10-year-old child: $104

Total cost = $109 + $104 = $213

Now, let's calculate the change they will receive:
They gave the cashier $500.

The couple's ticket costs $109, but since both are children below 12 years old, they each receive a $5 discount, making the total cost $109 - $5 = $104 for the couple. Adding the child's ticket costs, the total cost for the couple and the two children is $104 (couple) + $109 (first child) + $5 (discount) = $218. If they gave the cashier $500, the change they will receive is $500 - $218 = $282.

To determine the change, we first need to calculate the total cost for the tickets. The couple will need two regular tickets, and the children will each have a $5 discount.

The regular ticket costs $109, so for two tickets, it would be $109 * 2 = $218. 

For each child, the ticket costs $109 - $5 = $104. Since there are two children, the total for the children's tickets is $104 * 2 = $208.

Adding these together, the total cost for two adults and two children is $218 + $208 = $426.

The couple gave the cashier $500, so the change they will receive is $500 - $426 = $74.
