system
To find out how many ceilings will be left to paint after next week, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, calculate how many ceilings Michelangelo will paint next week, which is 1/4 the number of ceilings he painted this week.

2. Then, calculate the total number of ceilings painted by the end of next week by adding the ceilings painted this week to the ceilings painted next week.

3. Finally, subtract the total number of ceilings painted by the end of next week from the initial number of ceilings to find out how many are left to paint.

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Calculating the number of ceilings painted next week:
\[ \text{Ceilings painted next week} = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3 \]

2. Calculating the total number of ceilings painted by the end of next week:
\[ \text{Total ceilings painted} = 12 + 3 = 15 \]

3. Calculating the number of ceilings left to paint after next week:
\[ \text{Ceilings left to paint} = 28 - 15 = 13 \]

So, after next week, there will be 13 ceilings left to paint.

After this week, Michelangelo will paint an additional 1/4 of 12, which is 3 ceilings. So, he will paint 12 + 3 = 15 ceilings next week. Thus, 28 - 15 = 13 ceilings will still be left to paint after next week.

Reasoning:

1. Michelangelo has 28 ceilings to paint.
2. This week, he paints 12 ceilings.
3. Next week, he will paint \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of ceilings he painted this week, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) ceilings.
4. To find out how many ceilings will be left to paint after next week, subtract the number of ceilings painted this and next week from the total number of ceilings:
   - Ceilings left after this week: 28 - 12 = 16
   - Ceilings left after next week: 16 - 3 = 13

To find out how many ceilings will be left to paint after next week, we first need to determine the total number of ceilings Michelangelo will paint in two weeks.

This week, he paints 12 ceilings.
Next week, he will paint 1/4 of the number he painted this week, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ ceilings} \]

So, in total, after next week, he will have painted:
\[ 12 \text{ (this week)} + 3 \text{ (next week)} = 15 \text{ ceilings} \]

Michelangelo has 28 ceilings to paint. Therefore, the number of ceilings left to paint is:
\[ 28 \text{ - 15} = 13 \text{ ceilings} \]

First, we need to determine how many ceilings Michelangelo will paint next week. Since he will paint one-fourth the number of ceilings he did this week, we calculate:

\[
\text{Ceilings painted next week} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Ceilings painted this week} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Next, we add the ceilings he painted this week and the ones he will paint next week to find the total number of ceilings painted after next week:

\[
\text{Total ceilings painted} = \text{Ceilings painted this week} + \text{Ceilings painted next week} = 12 + 3 = 15
\]

Michelangelo started with 28 ceilings to paint. After he paints 15 ceilings, the number of ceilings left to paint is:

\[
\text{Ceilings left to paint} = 28 - 15 = 13
\]

So, the number of ceilings that will be left to paint after next week is 13.

system
Firstly, let's determine how many ceilings Michelangelo will paint next week. He plans to paint \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of ceilings he paints this week.

This week, he paints 12 ceilings. Therefore, next week he will paint:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ ceilings}
\]

Next week, he will have painted a total of:
\[
12 + 3 = 15 \text{ ceilings}
\]

Michelangelo started with 28 ceilings to paint. After painting 15 this week and next week, the number of ceilings left to paint will be:
\[
28 - 15 = 13 \text{ ceilings}
\]

So, after next week, he will have 13 ceilings left to paint.

Initially, Michelangelo has 28 ceilings to paint. This week, he paints 12 of them. Next week, he will paint 1/4 the number of ceilings he did this week, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) ceilings. To find out how many ceilings will be left to paint after next week, we subtract the number of ceilings he will paint next week from the remaining ceilings he will paint this week:

\( 12 - 3 = 9 \) ceilings left to paint this week.

Now, we add this to the number of remaining ceilings for next week:

\( 12 + 3 = 15 \) ceilings.

Subtracting this from the total number of ceilings will give us the remaining ones:

\( 28 - 15 = 13 \) ceilings left to paint.

   Michelangelo paints 1/4 of the 12 ceilings he painted this week.
   \[
   \text{Ceilings painted next week} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3

2. Calculate the total number of ceilings painted in the two weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total ceilings painted} = \text{Ceilings painted this week} + \text{Ceilings painted next week} = 12 + 3 = 15
   \]

3. Calculate the number of ceilings left to paint after next week:
   \[
   \text{Ceilings left} = \text{Total ceilings} - \text{Total ceilings painted} = 28 - 15 = 13
   \]

Therefore, after next week, there will be 13 ceilings left to paint.

In the first week, Michelangelo paints 12 ceilings. In the second week, he will paint \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of ceilings he painted in the first week. So, the number of ceilings he will paint in the second week is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) ceilings.

The total number of ceilings painted in the first two weeks will be \( 12 + 3 = 15 \).

Therefore, the number of ceilings left to paint after next week will be \( 28 - 15 = 13 \).

Reasoning:

1. This week, Michelangelo paints 12 ceilings.
2. Next week, he will paint a fraction of the original amount he painted this week. 1/4 of 12 is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
   \]
   So, next week he will paint 3 ceilings.
3. To find how many ceilings will be left to paint after next week, subtract the ceilings painted this week and the next week from the total number of ceilings:
   \[
   28 - 12 - 3 = 13
   \]

Therefore, there will be 13 ceilings left to paint after next week.

First, let's determine how many ceilings Michelangelo paints in the next week. He paints 1/4 of the 12 ceilings he painted this week:

\[ \text{Ceilings painted next week} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now we can calculate the total number of ceilings painted over the two weeks:

\[ \text{Total ceilings painted} = 12 + 3 = 15 \]

Michelangelo originally had 28 ceilings to paint. After the two weeks, the number of ceilings left to paint is:

\[ \text{Ceils left to paint} = 28 - 15 = 13 \]

To determine how many ceilings will be left to paint after next week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ceilings Michelangelo will paint next week.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of ceilings to find out how many are left after next week.

First, we know that Michelangelo painted 12 ceilings this week. Next week, he will paint \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of ceilings he painted this week.

So, the number of ceilings he will paint next week is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3 \]

Next, we subtract the number of ceilings he will paint next week from the total number of ceilings:
\[ 28 - 3 = 25 \]

Therefore, after next week, Michelangelo will have 25 ceilings left to paint.

To determine how many ceilings Michelangelo will have left to paint after next week, we start by calculating the number of ceilings he will paint next week. Next week, he will paint \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of ceilings he painted this week, which is 12. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Next, we find the total number of ceilings Michelangelo will have painted after next week. This is the sum of the ceilings painted this week and the ceilings he will paint next week:

\[ 12 + 3 = 15 \]

Initially, Michelangelo has 28 ceilings to paint. After next week, he will have painted 15 ceilings, so the number of ceilings left to paint is:

\[ 28 - 15 = 13 \]

Therefore, after next week, Michelangelo will have 13 ceilings left to paint.
