system
To find the total number of ants found by Abe, Beth, CeCe, and Duke, we need to calculate the number of ants each child found and then sum them up.

1. **Abe's Ants**: Abe finds 4 ants.
2. **Beth's Ants**: Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. 
   To find 50% of 4 ants: 
   \[ 0.50 \times 4 = 2 \]
   Adding this to Abe's 4 ants gives:
   \[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]
   Beth finds 6 ants.

3. **CeCe's Ants**: CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe.
   Twice 4 ants is:
   \[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]
   CeCe finds 8 ants.

4. **Duke's Ants**: Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe.
   Half of 4 ants is:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]
   Duke finds 2 ants.

Now, we sum the ants found by each child:
- Abe's ants: 4
- Beth's ants: 6
- CeCe's ants: 8
- Duke's ants: 2

\[ 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of ants found by the four children together is:

To find the total number of ants found by Abe, Beth, CeCe, and Duke together, we need to calculate the number of ants each child found based on the information given and then sum these amounts.

Abe finds 4 ants. 

Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. To find the number of ants Beth sees, we calculate 50% of Abe's ants and add it to Abe's total. 
50% of 4 ants is 2 ants.

So, Beth finds 4 + 2 = 6 ants.

CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe. Since Abe found 4 ants, CeCe finds 4 * 2 = 8 ants.

Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe. So Duke finds 4 / 2 = 2 ants.

Now we can sum up the number of ants each child found:
Abe's ants: 4
Beth's ants: 6
CeCe's ants: 8
Duke's ants: 2

Total ants = Abe's ants + Beth's ants + CeCe's ants + Duke's ants
Total ants = 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20

Thus, the four children find a total of 20 ants together.

Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. Abe finds 4 ants.
2. Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. To find 50% more, we calculate 0.50 * 4 = 2 ants. Adding this to Abe's 4 ants gives us Beth's count: 4 + 2 = 6 ants.
3. CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe. So, we multiply Abe's count by 2: 4 * 2 = 8 ants.
4. Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe. So, we divide Abe's count by 2: 4 / 2 = 2 ants.

Now, to find the total number of ants the four children find together, we add their counts:

Abe: 4 ants
Beth: 6 ants
CeCe: 8 ants
Duke: 2 ants

Total = 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20 ants.

Therefore, the total number of ants that the four children find together is **20**.

First, we need to find out how many ants Beth, CeCe, and Duke see. Since Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe, she sees 4 + 0.5(4) = 4 + 2 = 6 ants. CeCe sees twice as many ants as Abe, so she sees 4 * 2 = 8 ants. Duke sees half as many ants as Abe, so he sees 4 / 2 = 2 ants.

Now, we add up the number of ants seen by all four children: 4 (Abe) + 6 (Beth) + 8 (CeCe) + 2 (Duke) = 20 ants in total.

From the problem, we know that Abe finds 4 ants. 

Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe, so Beth sees \(4 \times (1 + 0.5) = 4 \times 1.5 = 6\) ants.

CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe, so CeCe watches \(4 \times 2 = 8\) ants.

Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe, so Duke discovers \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\) ants.

To find the total number of ants, we add up the ants each child finds:
\[4 \text{ (Abe)} + 6 \text{ (Beth)} + 8 \text{ (CeCe)} + 2 \text{ (Duke)} = 20 \text{ ants}\]

Therefore, the four children find together 20 ants.

To find the total number of ants the children find together, we can calculate the number of ants each child finds separately and then add them up.

1. Abe finds 4 ants.
2. Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. To find this, we calculate 50% of Abe's number of ants and add it to Abe's number: \(4 + 0.5 \times 4 = 4 + 2 = 6\). So, Beth finds 6 ants.
3. CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe. Thus, CeCe finds \(2 \times 4 = 8\) ants.
4. Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe. So, Duke finds \(4 / 2 = 2\) ants.

Now, we add the number of ants each child finds to get the total:

- Abe's ants: 4
- Beth's ants: 6
- CeCe's ants: 8
- Duke's ants: 2

Total ants = 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20

Therefore, the total number of ants the four children find together is 20.

To find the total number of ants found by Abe, Beth, CeCe, and Duke together, we need to calculate the number of ants each child finds and then sum them up. 

First, Abe finds 4 ants.

Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of 4 and add it to 4:
\[
50\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.5 \times 4 = 2
\]
\[
\text{Beth's ants} = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe. This means:
\[
\text{CeCe's ants} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe. To find half of 4, we calculate:
\[
\text{Duke's ants} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

Now, we sum up the ants found by Abe, Beth, CeCe, and Duke:
\[
\text{Total ants} = \text{Abe's ants} + \text{Beth's ants} + \text{CeCe's ants} + \text{Duke's ants} = 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20

Thus, the total number of ants found by the four children together is 20.

To determine the total number of ants found by the four children, we start by finding the number of ants each child sees.

Abe finds 4 ants.

Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. To calculate this, we take 50% of 4 ants and add it to 4. The increase in ants is \(0.5 \times 4 = 2\). Therefore, Beth finds \(4 + 2 = 6\) ants.

CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe. Since Abe finds 4 ants, CeCe finds \(2 \times 4 = 8\) ants.

Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe. Since Abe finds 4 ants, Duke finds \(4 / 2 = 2\) ants.

Now, we sum the ants found by all four children:
\[4 (Abe) + 6 (Beth) + 8 (CeCe) + 2 (Duke) = 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

So, the total number of ants found by the four children together is \(20\).

2. Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. This means Beth sees 4 + (50/100 * 4) = 4 + 2 = 6 ants.
3. CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe. This means CeCe sees 4 * 2 = 8 ants.
4. Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe. This means Duke sees 4 / 2 = 2 ants.

Now, let's add them all together:

4 (Abe) + 6 (Beth) + 8 (CeCe) + 2 (Duke) = 20 ants.

To find out how many ants each child finds, we start with the number Abe finds, which is 4 ants.

Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. To calculate the number of ants Beth sees, we take 50% of Abe's ants and add it to Abe's number:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \text{ ants} \]
