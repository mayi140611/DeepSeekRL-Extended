#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To determine how much Mr. Benson paid in total, we first calculate the base cost for 12 tickets without any discounts. Then we apply the discount to the tickets that exceed 10.

1. **Calculate the base cost:**
\[ 12 \text{ tickets} \times \$40 \text{ per ticket} = \$480 \]

2. **Determine the number of tickets exceeding 10 and the total discount amount:**
\[ 12 \text{ tickets} - 10 \text{ tickets} = 2 \text{ tickets} \]
\[ \text{Discount rate} = 5\% = 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Total discount} = 2 \text{ tickets} \times \$40 \text{ per ticket} \times 0.05 = \$4 \]

3. **Calculate the total discount amount:**
\[ \$4 \]

4. **Subtract the total discount from the base cost to determine the final amount paid:**
\[ \$480 - \$4 = \$476 \]

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid a total of \$476 for the concert tickets.

To determine how much Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to calculate the cost of each ticket after applying the discount.

1. **Calculate the number of discounted tickets:**
   Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, but he received a discount for every ticket that exceeds 10. This means:
   \[
   \text{Number of discounts} = 12 - 10 = 2
   \]
   So, 2 tickets are discounted, and \(12 - 2 = 10\) tickets are not discounted.

2. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   The cost per ticket is $40. Therefore, the total cost without any discount is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 12 \times 40 = 480
   \]

3. **Calculate the total discount amount:**
   Since Mr. Benson received a 5% discount on each of the 2 discounted tickets, the discount amount per discounted ticket is:
   \[
   \text{Discount per ticket} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2
   \]
   Therefore, the total discount amount is:
   \[
   \text{Total discount} = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost after applying the discount:**
   The total cost after the discount is the total cost without discount minus the total discount:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 480 - 4 = 476
   \]

Thus, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for the concert tickets.

To calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to consider the discount on the tickets that exceed 10. Since Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, 2 of them are eligible for the discount. The discount per ticket that exceeds 10 is 5%, so for 2 tickets, the discount is 10%. 

The cost of one ticket after the discount is reduced by 5% is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.05) = 40 \times 0.95 \]

So for each of the 2 discounted tickets, the total cost after discount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.95 \times 2 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 40 \times 0.95 \times 2 = 76 \times 2 = 152 \]

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid $152 for the discounted tickets.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Cost per ticket before discount:**
   Each ticket costs $40.

2. **Number of tickets bought:**
   Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets.

3. **Discount criteria:**
   Mr. Benson receives a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10.

   - The first 10 tickets (the first 10 tickets he bought) do not receive any discount.
   - Therefore, the next 2 tickets (tickets 11 and 12) will receive a 5% discount each.

4. **Calculate the discount for the additional tickets:**
   Each of the additional 2 tickets will be discounted by 5%.

   - Discount per additional ticket:
     \[
     40 \times 0.05 = 2
     \]

   - Total discount for 2 additional tickets:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   Total cost for 12 tickets:
   \[
   12 \times 40 = 480
   \]

6. **Calculate the total discount:**
   Total discount for 2 additional tickets:
   \[
   4
   \]

7. **Calculate the total amount paid after discount:**
   Subtract the total discount from the total cost before discount:
   \[
   480 - 4 = 476
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid $476 in all.

8. **Verification:**
   - Cost for 10 standard tickets: \(10 \times 40 = 400\)
   - Cost for 2 discounted tickets: \(4 \times 4 = 16\)
   - Total cost: \(400 + 16 = 416\)
   - Subtracting the total discount: \(416 - 4 = 476\)

Thus, Mr. Benson paid $476 in all.

9. **Final answer:** 
   \[
   \boxed{476}
   \]

To calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid, we first need to apply the discount for each ticket that exceeds 10 tickets.

First, let's calculate the discount on the extra tickets:
Extra tickets = 12 - 10 = 2 tickets
Discount on each extra ticket = 5% of $40 = $40 * 0.05 = $2

Total discount for extra tickets = 2 tickets * $2/ticket = $4

Now, let's calculate the total cost without the discount and then apply the discount:
Total cost without discount = 12 tickets * $40/ticket = $480

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the total cost:
Total amount paid = $480 - $4 = $476

Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for the concert tickets.

To determine how much Mr. Benson paid for 12 concert tickets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets.
2. Determine the cost of the additional 2 tickets after applying the discount.
3. Sum the costs from steps 1 and 2.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets.
Cost per ticket = $40
Number of tickets = 10
Cost for the first 10 tickets = 10 * $40 = $400

Step 2: Determine the cost of the additional 2 tickets.
Discount rate for excess tickets = 5%
Cost per ticket after discount = $40 - (0.05 * $40) = $40 - $2 = $38

Number of additional tickets = 2
Cost for the additional 2 tickets = 2 * $38 = $76

Step 3: Sum the costs from steps 1 and 2.
Total cost = Cost for the first 10 tickets + Cost for the additional 2 tickets
Total cost = $400 + $76 = $476

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid $476 in all for the 12 tickets.

To find out how much Mr. Benson paid in all, let's break down the total cost step by step:

Initially, Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets at full price, which is $40 per ticket. This amounts to:
\[ 12 \text{ tickets} \times \$40 \text{ per ticket} = \$480 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount for the tickets that exceed 10 tickets. Since Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, he exceeded 10 tickets by:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

The discount for each additional ticket is 5%, so for 2 tickets, the total discount would be:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets} \times 5\% \text{ discount per ticket} = 2 \times 0.05 = \$1 \]

After applying this discount, the price per ticket is reduced by $1. The discount on the remaining 2 tickets means each of these tickets now costs:
\[ \$40 - \$1 = \$39 \]

Therefore, the total cost for the remaining 2 tickets is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets} \times \$39 \text{ per ticket} = \$78 \]

Finally, adding the cost of the original 10 tickets and the discounted 2 tickets gives us the total amount Mr. Benson paid:
\[ \$480 + \$78 = \$558 \]

So, Mr. Benson paid \$558 in all.

To calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to account for the discounts he received.

1. First, calculate the cost of 12 tickets without any discount:
\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 12 \times \$40 = \$480 \]

2. Since Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, he qualifies for a 5% discount on each ticket that exceeds 10. There is one ticket that exceeds 10:
\[ \text{Discount on one ticket} = 1 \times \$40 \times 5\% = \$40 \times 0.05 = \$2 \]

3. Now, subtract the discount from the total cost without discount:
\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = \$480 - \$2 = \$478 \]

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid \$478 in all for the concert tickets.

To calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid, we first need to determine the discount he received. He bought 12 tickets, so the discount is for 12 - 10 = 2 tickets. Each ticket's discount is 5%, so for 2 tickets, the total discount is 2 * 5% = 10%. This means Mr. Benson received a 10% discount on the total cost of his purchase.

The original price for 12 tickets is $40 each, so the total price without any discount would be 12 * $40 = $480. With a 10% discount, the total payment is 90% of $480, which is $$480 * 0.90 = $432.

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid $432 in all.

To calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid, we can break down the problem into two parts.

1. First, we need to calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets without any discount:
\[10 tickets \times \$40 \text{ per ticket} = \$400\]

2. Next, we calculate the 5% discount for the tickets that exceed 10:
\[5\% \text{ discount for } 2 \text{ tickets} = 0.05 \times 2 \text{ tickets} \times \$40 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\]

3. Finally, we add the cost of the first 10 tickets to the cost of the remaining 2 tickets with the discount:

To calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to first calculate the cost of each ticket after the discount is applied.

The discount is 5% for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. Since Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, which exceeds 10, he is eligible for a discount on all 12 tickets.

The discount on one ticket is 5% of $40, which is:
\[ 40 \times \frac{5}{100} = 40 \times 0.05 = $2 \]

So, the cost of each discounted ticket is:
\[ 40 - 2 = $38 \]

Since Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets at $38 each, the total cost for all 12 tickets is:
\[ 12 \times 38 = $456 \]

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid a total of $456 for the concert tickets.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The base price of one concert ticket is $40.
2. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, which is 2 tickets more than the maximum allowed under the discount rate (12 - 10 = 2 tickets).
3. For each ticket that exceeds the discount threshold, Mr. Benson receives a 5% discount. However, since the discount applies only to the excess tickets (2 tickets), we need to calculate the total discount for these 2 tickets.

The calculation for the discount per ticket:
\[ \text{Discount per ticket} = \text{Original price} \times \text{Discount rate} = \$40 \times 5\% = \$40 \times 0.05 = \$2 \]

The total discount for 2 tickets:
\[ \text{Total discount} = \text{Discount per ticket} \times \text{Number of exceeding tickets} = \$2 \times 2 = \$4 \]

Finally, to find out how much Mr. Benson paid in total, we subtract the total discount from the original total cost:
\[ \text{Total paid} = \text{Total cost without discount} - \text{Total discount} = \$40 \times 12 - \$4 = \$480 - \$4 = \$476 \]

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid $476 in total.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets.
2. The original price per ticket is $40.
3. He received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10.
4. We need to calculate the total cost for 12 tickets.

First, calculate the total cost if no discounts were applied:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \times 40 \]

Next, determine how many tickets exceeded the 10-tickets threshold:

\[ \text{Excess tickets} = 12 - 10 \]

Now, calculate the total discount given since he bought 12 tickets:

\[ \text{Total discount} = \text{Total tickets} \times \text{Discount percentage} \]

Subtract the total discount from the original total cost to get the final amount Mr. Benson paid:

\[ \text{Final amount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total discount} \]

Let's perform the calculations:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \times 40 = 480 \]
\[ \text{Excess tickets} = 12 - 10 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Total discount} = 12 \times 5\% = 12 \times 0.05 = 0.60 \]
\[ \text{Final amount} = 480 - 0.60 = 479.40 \]
