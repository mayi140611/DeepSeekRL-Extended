system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Betty is 60 years old.
2. Her daughter is 40% younger than Betty. This means her daughter's age is 60 years minus 40% of 60 years.
   - 40% of 60 years is \(0.40 \times 60 = 24\) years.
   - Therefore, her daughter's age is \(60 - 24 = 36\) years old.
3. The granddaughter is one-third her mother's age. So, we calculate the granddaughter's age by dividing her mother's age by 3.
   - Her mother's age is 36 years, and we divide that by 3 to find the granddaughter's age.
   - Her granddaughter's age is \(36 \div 3 = 12\) years old.

So, the granddaughter is 12 years old.

To find the age of the granddaughter, we need to follow the steps below.

1. Calculate the age of Betty's daughter:
   Betty is 60 years old, and her daughter is 40% younger than Betty.
   The daughter's age is:
   \[
   60 - (60 \times 0.4) = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. Calculate the age of the granddaughter:
   The granddaughter is one-third of her mother's age.
   The granddaughter's age is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{3} = 12 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, the granddaughter is 12 years old.

To find out how old the granddaughter is, we first need to understand the age difference between the daughter and Betty. Betty is 60 years old, and her daughter is 40 percent younger. This means her daughter is 60 - (0.40 * 60) = 60 - 24 = 36 years old.

Now that we know the daughter's age, we can calculate the granddaughter's age, which is one-third of her mother's age. The daughter is 36 years old, so the granddaughter is 36 / 3 = 12 years old.

To find out the age of the granddaughter, we need to first determine the age of her mother. Since Betty is the oldest person in the family and her daughter is 40% younger than she is, her daughter's age is 60 - (40% of 60) = 60 - (0.4 * 60) = 60 - 24 = 36 years old.

The granddaughter's age is one-third of her mother's age. So we calculate the granddaughter's age by dividing her mother's age by 3: 36 / 3 = 12 years old.

Betty is 60 years old. 

To find out how old her daughter is, we calculate 40 percent of Betty's age:  
\( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \) years. 

So, Betty's daughter is younger than Betty by 24 years. Therefore, Betty's daughter is:
\( 60 - 24 = 36 \) years old.

Now, to find out how old the granddaughter is, we calculate one-third of her mother's age:  
\( 36 \times \frac{1}{3} = 12 \) years.

So, the granddaughter is 12 years old.

system
To find the age of the granddaughter, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the daughter's age:**
   Betty is 60 years old. Her daughter is 40 percent younger than Betty. This means the daughter's age is 60 years minus 40 percent of 60 years.
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, the daughter's age is:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Calculate the granddaughter's age:**
   The granddaughter's age is one-third of her mother's age. We know her mother is 36 years old.
   \[
   \text{Granddaughter's age} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, the granddaughter is 12 years old.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Betty's age is given as 60 years.
2. Her daughter is 40% younger than Betty, which means the daughter's age is 60 * (1 - 40%) = 60 * 0.6 = 36 years.
3. Her granddaughter's age is 1/3 of her mother's age, so the granddaughter's age is 36 * (1/3) = 12 years.

So, the granddaughter is 12 years old.

To determine Betty's granddaughter's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Betty's daughter's age**: Since Betty's daughter is 40 percent younger than Betty, we can find her age by subtracting 40 percent of Betty's age from Betty's age. This can be calculated using the formula: \( \text{Daughter's age} = \text{Betty's age} - (\text{Betty's age} \times 0.40) \).

2. **Calculate the granddaughter's age**: The granddaughter is one-third the age of her mother (Betty's daughter). So, we can find the granddaughter's age by dividing Betty's daughter's age by 3.

Let's perform these calculations step-by-step.

3. Betty's age is 60 years old.
4. Betty's daughter's age is \( 60 - (60 \times 0.40) = 60 - 24 = 36 \) years old.
5. The granddaughter's age is \( 36 / 3 = 12 \).

So, Betty's granddaughter is 12 years old.

Betty is 60 years old.
Her daughter is 40% younger than Betty, so let's calculate the daughter's age:
Daughter's age = Betty's age - (40% of Betty's age)
Daughter's age = 60 - (0.40 * 60)
Daughter's age = 60 - 24
Daughter's age = 36 years old

Now, Betty's granddaughter is one-third of her mother's age, so let's calculate the granddaughter's age:
Granddaughter's age = 1/3 * Daughter's age
Granddaughter's age = 1/3 * 36
Granddaughter's age = 12 years old

Therefore, the granddaughter is 12 years old.

To find the granddaughter's age, we first need to calculate her mother's age in relation to Betty's age. If Betty is 60 years old and her daughter is 40% younger, we calculate:

\[ \text{Daughter’s age} = 60 - (60 \times 0.4) = 60 \times 0.6 = 36 \]

Next, we find the granddaughter's age, which is one-third of her mother's age:

\[ \text{Granddaughter’s age} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]

Therefore, the granddaughter is 12 years old.

To determine the age of the granddaughter, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the age of Betty's daughter.
2. Calculate the age of the granddaughter based on the daughter's age.

First, calculate the age of Betty's daughter:
Betty is 60 years old, and her daughter is 40 percent younger than she is. This means the daughter's age is 60 years minus 40 percent of 60 years.
\[ 60 \times (1 - 0.40) = 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \]
So, the daughter is 36 years old.

Next, calculate the age of the granddaughter:
The granddaughter is one-third her mother's age. Since her mother is 36 years old, we calculate:
\[ 36 \times \frac{1}{3} = 12 \]
So, the granddaughter is 12 years old.

Therefore, the granddaughter is 12 years old.

To determine the age of Betty's granddaughter, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the age of Betty's daughter.
2. Use the daughter's age to find the granddaughter's age.

Step 1: Calculate the daughter's age.
Betty is 60 years old, and her daughter is 40% younger than Betty. This means the daughter is 60% of Betty's age.

\[ \text{Daughter's age} = 60 \times \left(1 - \frac{40}{100}\right) = 60 \times 0.6 = 36 \]

Step 2: Calculate the granddaughter's age.
Betty's granddaughter is one-third the age of her mother.

\[ \text{Granddaughter's age} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]

So, the granddaughter is 12 years old.
