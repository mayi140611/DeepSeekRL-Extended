###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

First, we need to determine the number of women at the event. We know that there are 40 men and half the number of men are women. So, the number of women is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

Next, we know that the rest of the guests are children. Initially, the total number of guests is 80, and there are 40 men and 20 women. So, the number of children initially is \( 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \).

If Oleg adds 10 more children to the list, the total number of children will be \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).

First, let's determine the number of women at the event. The problem states that half the number of men are women. Since there are 40 men, the number of women is:

20 women = 1/2 * 40 men

Now let's calculate the total number of women:

20 women = 20 women

Next, we need to find out the total number of men and women combined:

20 men + 20 women = 40 guests

The total number of guests is 80, so the rest are children:

80 total guests - 40 men and women = 40 children

If Oleg adds 10 more children to the guest list, the new number of children will be:

40 children + 10 children = 50 children

So, there will be 50 children at the event.

First, let's determine the number of men at the event. We know that Oleg's event has 80 guests and 40 of them are men.

The number of women is half the number of men, so:
Number of women = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)

Next, we find the number of children by subtracting the number of men and women from the total number of guests:
Number of children = \( 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \)

Now, if Oleg adds 10 more children to the guest list, the new number of children will be:
New number of children = \( 20 + 10 = 30 \)

1. First, let's find out how many women are at the event. Since there are half the number of men as women, the number of women is \(40 / 2 = 20\).
2. Initially, there are 80 guests in total, with 40 men and 20 women. The rest are children, so the number of children is \(80 - (40 + 20) = 80 - 60 = 20\).
3. If Oleg adds 10 more children to the guest list, the total number of children becomes \(20 + 10 = 30\).

Let's first determine how many women are at the event. Since the number of women is half the number of men, and there are 40 men, there are 40 / 2 = 20 women.

Now, let's find out the number of women and children. There are 40 men and 20 women, so there are 40 + 20 = 60 adults in total.

The total number of guests is 80, so the number of children is 80 - 60 = 20 children.

If Oleg adds 10 more children to the guest list, the total number of children will be 20 + 10 = 30 children.

1. First, determine the number of women guests:
   - Since half the number of men are women, and there are 40 men, there are \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) women guests.
   
2. Next, calculate the current number of guests:
   - There are 40 men and 20 women, so the total number of adults (men and women) is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).
   - The event has 80 guests in total, so the number of children is \( 80 - 60 = 20 \).
 
3. If Oleg adds 10 children to the guest list, the new number of children will be \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).

Initially, we know that there are 40 men at the event. Since half the number of men are women, there are \( 40 / 2 = 20 \) women. The rest of the guests are children. The total number of guests is 80, so the number of children can be calculated by subtracting the number of men and women from the total:

\[ \text{Children} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \]

If Oleg adds 10 children to the guest list, the new total number of children will be:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So there will be 30 children at the event after adding 10 more.

Let's calculate the number of each type of guests first.

1. We're told there are 80 guests in total.
2. The number of men is given as 40.
3. The number of women is half the number of men, which means there are \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) women.
4. The remaining guests are children. Since the total number of guests is 80 and we already accounted for 40 men and 20 women, the number of children is \( 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \).

Now, if Oleg adds 10 children to the guest list, the new number of children will be \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).

First, let's determine the number of women at the event.

Given that there are 40 men and half the number of men are women, we calculate the number of women as follows:
\[ \text{Number of women} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Next, we know the total number of guests at the event is 80. To find the number of children, we subtract the number of men and women from the total number of guests:
\[ \text{Number of children initially} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, if Oleg adds 10 children to the guest list, the new number of children will be:
\[ \text{New number of children} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of children at the event will be 30.

From the problem, we know that there are 80 guests in total. Out of these, 40 are men, which means there are half the number of women, so there are 20 women. The rest, which are children, would be 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 children to start with. 

If Oleg adds 10 more children to the guest list, the total number of children will be 20 + 10 = 30.

First, let's break down the details given in the problem:
- There are 80 guests in total.
- 40 of them are men.
- The number of women is twice the number of men, so there are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) women.
- The rest are children.
Let's calculate the number of children:
\[ 80 \text{ guests} - 40 \text{ men} - 80 \text{ women} = 0 \text{ children} \]
Since there are no children initially, if Oleg adds 10 children to the guest list, the number of children will now be:
\[ 0 \text{ children} + 10 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ children} \]

Oleg initially has 80 guests at the event. Out of these, half the number of men are women. Therefore, the number of women is 40 / 2 = 20.

The total number of men and women is 40 + 20 = 60.

This leaves 80 - 60 = 20 children as guests.

If Oleg adds 10 children to the guest list, the total number of children at the event will be 20 + 10 = 30.

We start by determining the number of women at the event. Since the number of women is half the number of men, and there are 40 men, there are \(40 / 2 = 20\) women.

Next, we find the number of children by subtracting the number of men and women from the total number of guests. So, there are \(80 - 40 - 20 = 20\) children initially.

If Oleg adds 10 children to the guest list, the number of children will become \(20 + 10 = 30\).

Therefore, there will be 30 children at the event.

First, we need to determine the number of women at the event. According to the problem, there are half the number of women as there are men. Since there are 40 men, the number of women is:

\[ \text{Number of women} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the number of children. The total number of guests is 80, and we know the number of men and women. So, we can calculate the number of children as follows:

\[ \text{Number of children} = 80 - (\text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women}) \]
\[ \text{Number of children} = 80 - (40 + 20) \]
\[ \text{Number of children} = 80 - 60 \]
\[ \text{Number of children} = 20 \]

Now, it is mentioned that Oleg added 10 more children to the guest list. Therefore, the new number of children is:

\[ \text{New number of children} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
