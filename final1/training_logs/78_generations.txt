To find out how many slices are left, we start by calculating the total number of slices that can be obtained from the 3 cookie pies, which are cut into 10 slices each, and then we subtract the slices that Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith have consumed.

First, we multiply the number of cookie pies by the number of slices per pie:
3 pies * 10 slices/pie = 30 slices

Next, we account for the slices consumed by Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith:
Manny's classmates: 24 people * 1 slice/person = 24 slices
Manny: 1 slice
Mr. Keith: 1 slice

Total slices consumed: 24 (classmates) + 1 (Manny) + 1 (Mr. Keith) = 26 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices consumed from the total number of slices available:
30 slices - 26 slices = 4 slices

Therefore, 4 slices are left.

To determine how many slices of cookie pie are left after Manny and his classmates have had their share, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of people present. This includes Manny, his 24 classmates, and his teacher Mr. Keith. So, there are \(1 + 24 + 1 = 26\) people in total.

2. Determine how many slices of pie each person gets. Since there are 3 pie slices per person and all 26 people have had 1 slice each, the total number of slices consumed is \(26 \times 1 = 26\).

3. Subtract the number of slices consumed from the original number of slices. Since there were 3 pie slices in total and 26 slices were consumed, the number of slices left is \(3 - 26 = -23\).

This calculation indicates that the total number of slices is insufficient to satisfy the demand of 26 people. Therefore, no slices are left.

**Answer:** The number of slices left is 0.

To find out how many cookie slices are left, we need to first calculate how many slices were made from all the pies. Manny had 3 birthday cookie pies, each cut into 10 slices. So the total number of slices from all the pies would be:

3 pies * 10 slices per pie = 30 slices

Now we know that Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith all had 1 piece each. There are 25 people in total (Manny + 24 classmates + Mr. Keith), so the total number of slices they all had would be:

25 people * 1 slice per person = 25 slices

Now we can subtract the number of slices consumed by the group from the total number of slices. So the number of slices left would be:

30 slices - 25 slices = 5 slices

Therefore, 5 slices are left.

To determine how many slices of cookie pie are left, we first calculate the total number of people who can have a piece. This includes Manny, his 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith, which totals \(1 + 24 + 1 = 26\) people.

Each of the 3 cookie pies is cut into 10 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Since 26 people are sharing the slices, the number of slices left is \(30 - 26 = 4\).

So, the number of slices left is 4.

To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices and then subtract the number of slices eaten.

First, calculate the total number of slices:
Each pie is cut into 10 slices, and Manny has 3 pies:
\[ 3 \, \text{pies} \times 10 \, \text{slices per pie} = 30 \, \text{slices} \]

Next, calculate the total number of people who had a piece of pie:
Manny + 24 classmates + 1 teacher = 26 people

Each of these 26 people had 1 slice:
\[ 26 \, \text{people} \times 1 \, \text{slice per person} = 26 \, \text{slices} \]

Now, subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 \, \text{slices} - 26 \, \text{slices} = 4 \, \text{slices} \]

Therefore, 4 slices are left.

First, we determine the total number of people who will be sharing the cookie pies. Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith make a total of:
\[ 1 + 24 + 1 = 26 \text{ people} \]

Each of the 3 cookie pies is cut into 10 slices. Thus, the total number of slices available is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of slices consumed. Since there are 26 people and each of them has 1 slice, the total number of slices consumed is:
\[ 26 \text{ slices} \]

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the number of slices consumed from the total number of slices available:
\[ 30 - 26 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the number of slices left is:

To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices were there in total and then subtract the number of slices consumed.

- Each cookie pie was cut into 10 slices, and Manny had 3 cookie pies, which means there were 3 * 10 = 30 slices initially.
- Manny's 24 classmates and his teacher, Mr. Keith, all had one piece each, so there were a total of 24 + 1 + 1 = 26 slices consumed.
- Therefore, the number of slices left is 30 - 26 = 4 slices.

Now, let's check the logic:
- Initially, there were 3 * 10 = 30 slices.
- After people had eaten their slices, there were 26 slices left for Manny and his classmates.
- We calculate the number of slices left for Manny and his classmates as 30 - 26 = 4.

So, the number of slices left is 4.

To find out how many slices of cookie pie are left, we first need to determine the total number of people sharing the pies. Manny has 24 classmates and 1 teacher, Mr. Keith, so the total number of people is:

\[ \text{Total people} = \text{Manny} + \text{Classmates} + \text{Teacher} \]
\[ \text{Total people} = 1 + 24 + 1 = 26 \]

Each of the 3 cookie pies is cut into 10 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Number of pies} \times \text{Slices per pie} \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, since Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith (the total number of people) all had 1 piece, they consumed:

\[ \text{Slices eaten} = \text{Total people} = 26 \]

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices:

\[ \text{Slices left} = \text{Total slices} - \text{Slices eaten} \]
\[ \text{Slices left} = 30 - 26 = 4 \]

So, there are 4 slices left.

To find out how many slices are left, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of people who will have a slice of cookie pie - this includes Manny, his 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith.

Total number of people = Manny + classmates + Mr. Keith = 1 + 24 + 1 = 26

2. Calculate the total number of doughnut slices in 3 pies - since each pie is cut into 10 slices:

Total slices = number of pies × slices per pie = 3 × 10 = 30

3. Subtract the number of people (who all get a slice) from the total number of doughnut slices to find out how many are left.

Leftover slices = total slices - total people = 30 - 26 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 slices left.

First, we need to determine the total number of people who will be eating cookie pie slices. That includes Manny, his 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith. We can calculate this total as follows:

\[ \text{Total number of people} = 1 \text{ (Manny)} + 24 \text{ (classmates)} + 1 \text{ (Mr. Keith)} = 26 \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices of cookie pie were initially available. Each of the 3 cookie pies was cut into 10 slices. Thus, the total number of slices is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total slices} = 3 \text{ (cookie pies)} \times 10 \text{ (slices per pie)} = 30 \]

Now that we know the total number of people (26), and the total number of slices (30), we can calculate the number of slices left after each person has had one piece:

\[ \text{Slices left} = 30 \text{ (slices)} - 26 \text{ (people)} = 4 \]

So, the number of slices left is 4.

To find out how many slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices available and the number of slices taken by Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith.

Each cookie pie is cut into 10 slices, so 3 cookie pies give us:
\[ 3 \text{ pies} \times 10 \text{ slices/pie} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Manny, his 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith make a total of 27 people. Each of them had 1 slice, so the total number of slices taken is:
\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ slice/person} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

However, before they took their slices, there were 30 slices available. Since they took 27 slices, the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 27 \text{ slices} = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, there are 3 slices left.

To find out how many slices of cookie pie are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices and then subtract the number of slices eaten by Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith.

First, let's determine the total number of people sharing the cookie pies:
Manny + 24 classmates + Mr. Keith = 1 + 24 + 1 = 26 people

Now, we know that each cookie pie is cut into 10 slices and 3 cookie pies are used for the total count:
Total slices from 3 pies = 3 * 10 = 30 slices

Next, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by the 26 people:
Total slices eaten = 26 * 1 = 26 slices

Lastly, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
Remaining slices = Total slices - Slices eaten = 30 - 26 = 4 slices

So, there are 4 slices left from the cookie pies.

First, calculate the total number of people who will be consuming the cookie slices. Since Manny is sharing the cake with 24 classmates and 1 teacher, we add these numbers together:

\[ 1 \text{ (Manny)} + 24 \text{ (classmates)} + 1 \text{ (teacher)} = 26 \text{ people} \]

Next, calculate the total number of cookie slices available. Since each pie is cut into 10 slices and there are 3 pies, we multiply the number of slices per pie by the number of pies:

\[ 3 \text{ (pies)} \times 10 \text{ (slices per pie)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we need to find out how many slices are left after the 26 people have eaten. Subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

\[ 30 \text{ (total slices)} - 26 \text{ (slices eaten)} = 4 \text{ slices left} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we need to determine the total number of people who can have a piece of the cookie pie and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

There are 2 people who do not take a piece of pie: Manny and Mr. Keith.

Each of the 3 pie will be cut into 10 slices so there are 30 slices in total.

Total number of slices that can be taken: (number of people x number of slices per pie) = (2 people x 30 slices) + 1 (Mr. Keith) for the whole pie = 60 + 1 = 61.

Since there are only 30 slices, that means that 31 slices are need (Manny + 24 classmates + Mr. Keith) and only 30 slices are available, which means 1 slice left.
