The price of the juice is twice the price of the bread. The bread costs $2, so the juice costs $2 * 2 = $4. Paul has spent $2 + $3 + $4 = $9. He had $15, so he has $15 - $9 = $6 left.

system
To find out how much money Paul had left, we first need to calculate the total cost of the groceries he bought.

The price of bread is $2.
The price of butter is $3.
The price of juice is two times the price of the bread, which is 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, we add up the costs:

Total cost of groceries = Cost of bread + Cost of butter + Cost of juice
Total = $2 + $3 + $4
Total = $9

Paul had $15 for his shopping, so we subtract the total cost of the groceries from the amount he had:

Money left = Amount Paul had - Total cost of groceries
Money left = $15 - $9
Money left = $6

Therefore, Paul had $6 left after his shopping.

#### GENERATION 10 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine how much money Paul has left after his shopping, we need to calculate the total cost of his purchases and then subtract that from the amount of money he initially had.

1. **Cost of bread**:  
   Paul bought bread for $2.

2. **Cost of butter**:  
   Paul bought butter for $3.

3. **Cost of juice**:  
   The price of juice is two times the price of the bread. Since the price of the bread is $2, the price of the juice is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total cost of groceries**:
   Adding the costs of bread, butter, and juice:
   \[
   2 + 3 + 4 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Money left**:
   Paul initially had $15. After spending $9 on groceries, the amount of money he has left is:
   \[
   15 - 9 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Paul has \(\boxed{6}\) dollars left.
