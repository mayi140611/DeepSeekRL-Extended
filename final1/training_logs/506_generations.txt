To determine how much James paid for the steaks, we first need to identify how many pounds of steak he actually bought. Since it's described as "buy one get one free," for every pound he buys, he gets another pound for free. 

So for 20 pounds of steak:
- He buys 20 pounds
- He gets another 20 pounds for free

Therefore, he only pays for 20 pounds of steak.

The price per pound is $15, so for 20 pounds of steak, he paid:
20 pounds * $15/pound = $300

To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the total pounds of steak James buys, and then multiply by the price per pound.

Since the price is $15 per pound and James buys 20 pounds, the total price will be 20 * $15 = $300.

Because the price is "buy one get one free," he only pays for 10 pounds (one of steak for each 20 pounds he buys).

So, the total cost James paid for the steaks is $300.

To calculate the total cost, we first need to determine the discounted price per pound, which is half of the original price because of the "buy one get one free" offer. So, the discounted price per pound is $15 / 2 = $7.50.

Then, we can find the total cost by multiplying the discounted price per pound by the number of pounds James bought. So, the total cost is $7.50/lb * 20 lb = $150.

Therefore, James paid $150 for the steaks.

system
To calculate the total cost of the steaks, we first need to determine the effective price per pound after applying the buy one get one free deal. 

Since James gets one steak free for every pound he buys, he will be paying for 10 pounds of steak (20 pounds / 2).

The price is $15 per pound, so for 10 pounds, the cost would be:

\( 10 \text{ pounds} \times \$15/\text{pound} = \$150 \)

So, James paid $150 for the steaks.

To calculate the total amount James paid for the steaks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pounds he actually paid for. Since it's "buy one get one free," he gets 20 pounds free when he purchases 20 pounds.

2. So, the actual pounds he paid for are 20 (purchase) - 20 (free) = 0 pounds.

3. Since he didn't pay for any pounds, the total amount he paid is $0.

Therefore, James paid $0 for the steaks.

To determine how much James paid for the steaks, we first need to understand the deal. For every pound he buys, he gets another pound free. So, if James buys 20 pounds, he only pays for 10 pounds.

The price of each pound of steak is $15, so for 10 pounds, the cost would be:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pound} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, James paid $150 for the steaks.

To calculate the total amount James paid for the steaks, we need to consider the buy one get one free offer. Since he buys 20 pounds, for every pound he purchases, he gets one pound free.

Therefore, he only needs to pay for half of the total weight.

Total weight = 20 pounds
Weight he pays for = 20 pounds / 2 = 10 pounds

Price per pound = $15

Total cost = Weight he pays for * Price per pound
Total cost = 10 pounds * $15/pound
Total cost = $150

So, James paid $150 for the steaks.

First, calculate the number of pounds James gets for free. Since there is a buy one get one free offer, for every 2 pounds he buys, he gets 1 pound free. So, for 20 pounds he buys:

20 pounds bought / 2 pounds per offer = 10 offers

Each offer includes 1 pound free, so he gets 10 pounds worth of free steaks. Therefore, the 20 pounds he bought amount to:

20 pounds - 10 pounds free = 10 pounds worth of steak

Now, calculate the total cost for the 10 pounds he intended to buy:

10 pounds * $15 per pound = $150 per offer

Since he bought multiple offers, we need to consider the total cost for these multiple offers. Since he bought an odd number of pounds, he would get an odd number of free steaks, but he can only count the 10 pounds he actually paid for. If we assume he bought 10 pounds, the calculation would be:

10 pounds * $15 per pound = $150

The $150 is the total cost he paid for the steaks.

To determine how much James paid for the steaks with the buy one get one free offer, we first need to understand the deal. For every pound he buys, he gets one pound free. Therefore, for 20 pounds he effectively gets 20 pounds of steak.

The price per pound of steak is $15. So, the total cost for 20 pounds at $15 per pound is calculated as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ pounds} \times \$15/\text{pound} = \$300 \]

Since he gets one pound free for every pound he buys, he only pays for 10 pounds (20 pounds total - 10 free pounds). However, the total cost is still $300 because the buy one get one free offer directly results in him paying for all 20 pounds without having to calculate the free pounds separately.

So, the amount James paid for the steaks is:

James buys 20 pounds of steak, but gets a buy one get one free offer. This means he only pays for half of the total weight. So he pays for 20/2 = 10 pounds of steak. At $15 per pound, he pays 10 * $15 = $150 for the steaks.
