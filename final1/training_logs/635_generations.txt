Currently, Tony is half of Jacob's age, so:
- Jacob is 24 years old.
- Tony is therefore 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

In 6 years, Jacob will be:
- 24 + 6 = 30 years old.

In 6 years, Tony will be:
- 12 + 6 = 18 years old.

So, in 6 years, Tony will be 18 years old.

To find out in how many years Tony will be, we need to determine his current age and then add 6 years. 

Tony is half Jacob's age, so Tony is currently 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, to find out Tony's age in 6 years, we add those 6 years to his current age: 12 + 6 = 18 years old.

So, in 6 years, Tony will be 18 years old.

Currently, Tony is half of Jacob's age, so Jacob's age now is 24 years. This means Tony's age now is:
\[ \text{Tony's current age} = \frac{24 \text{ years}}{2} = 12 \text{ years} \]

In 6 years, Jacob will be:
\[ 24 \text{ years} + 6 \text{ years} = 30 \text{ years} \]

In 6 years, Tony will be:
\[ 12 \text{ years} + 6 \text{ years} = 18 \text{ years} \]

So, in 6 years, Tony will be 18 years old.

#### GENERATION 10 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
Let's break down the information given:
1. Jacob is currently 24 years old.
2. Tony's current age is half of Jacob's age.

From the second piece of information, we can calculate Tony's current age:
\[ \text{Tony's current age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Jacob's current age} \]
\[ \text{Tony's current age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Tony's current age} = 12 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find out how old Tony will be in 6 years, we add 6 to his current age:
\[ \text{Tony's age in 6 years} = \text{Tony's current age} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Tony's age in 6 years} = 12 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Tony's age in 6 years} = 18 \]

So, if Tony's current age is 12, he will be 18 years old in 6 years.

Currently, Jacob is 24 years old, and Tony is half of that, which is 24 / 2 = 12 years old.
In 6 years, Jacob will be 24 + 6 = 30 years old. At that time, Tony will be 6 + 12 = 18 years old.
The difference in their ages will remain the same, as Tony's age will increase more slowly due to his early start. Therefore, Tony will be 18 years old in 6 years.
