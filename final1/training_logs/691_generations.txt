<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the total volume of the smoothie mixture. Carla uses 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream, so the total volume is:
\[ 500 \, \text{ml} + 100 \, \text{ml} = 600 \, \text{ml} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 150 ml servings can be made from the total 600 ml of smoothie mixture.

Number of servings = Total volume of mixture / Volume per serving:
\[ \frac{600 \, \text{ml}}{150 \, \text{ml/serving}} = 4 \, \text{servings} \]

Therefore, Carla can make 4 servings.

To determine how many 150 ml servings Carla can make, we first need to calculate the total volume of her smoothies. Carla is using 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream. Therefore, the total volume of the smoothie is:

\[ 500 \, \text{ml (watermelon puree)} + 100 \, \text{ml (cream)} = 600 \, \text{ml} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 150 ml servings can be made from the total volume of the smoothie. We do this by dividing the total volume by the volume of each serving:

\[ \frac{600 \, \text{ml}}{150 \, \text{ml/serving}} = 4 \]

So, Carla can make 4 servings of 150 ml each.

To determine how many 150 ml servings Carla can make, we first need to calculate the total volume of the smoothie mixture. This is done by adding the volume of watermelon puree to the volume of the cream:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 500 \text{ ml (watermelon puree)} + 100 \text{ ml (cream)} = 600 \text{ ml} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 150 ml servings can be made from the total volume. This is done by dividing the total volume by 150 ml:

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{600 \text{ ml}}{150 \text{ ml/serving}} \]

\[ \text{Number of servings} = 4 \]

So, Carla can make 4 servings of 150 ml each from the smoothie.

To find out how many 150 ml servings Carla can make, we first need to calculate the total volume of the smoothie mixture. This is done by adding the volumes of watermelon puree and cream:

Total volume = Volume of watermelon puree + Volume of cream
             = 500 ml + 100 ml
             = 600 ml

Now, we divide the total volume by the volume of each serving to find the number of servings:

Number of servings = Total volume / Volume of each serving
                  = 600 ml / 150 ml

Number of servings = 4

Therefore, Carla can make 4 servings of her smoothie.

To find out how many 150 ml servings Carla can make, we first need to calculate the total volume of the smoothie. The total volume is the sum of the watermelon puree and the cream. 

The total volume is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = \text{Volume of watermelon puree} + \text{Volume of cream} \]

Given:
\[ \text{Volume of watermelon puree} = 500 \text{ ml} \]
\[ \text{Volume of cream} = 100 \text{ ml} \]

So,
\[ \text{Total volume} = 500 \text{ ml} + 100 \text{ ml} = 600 \text{ ml} \]

Next, to find out how many 150 ml servings can be made from this total volume, we divide the total volume by the volume of each serving:
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Volume of each serving}} \]

So,
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{600 \text{ ml}}{150 \text{ ml}} \]

We can calculate this division:
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{600}{150} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carla can make 4 servings of 150 ml each.

To find out how many 150 ml servings Carla can make, we first need to determine the total volume of the smoothie mixture. Then, we can divide this total volume by the size of each serving (150 ml).

The total volume of the smoothie mixture is the sum of the watermelon puree and cream, which is 500 ml + 100 ml = 600 ml.

Now, to find out how many 150 ml servings we can make, we divide the total volume by the serving size: 

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Serving size}} \]

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{600 \, \text{ml}}{150 \, \text{ml/serving}} \]

\[ \text{Number of servings} = 4 \]

So, Carla can make 4 servings of 150 ml each.

To determine how many 150 ml servings Carla can make, we need to find the total volume of the smoothie and then divide that by the volume of one serving.

1. First, calculate the total volume of the smoothie:
   - Watermelon puree: 500 ml
   - Cream: 100 ml
   - Total volume: \( 500 ml + 100 ml = 600 ml \)

2. Now, find out how many 150 ml servings can be made from 600 ml:
   - Divide the total volume by the volume per serving: \( \frac{600 ml}{150 ml} = 4 \)

Therefore, Carla can make 4 servings of 150 ml each.
