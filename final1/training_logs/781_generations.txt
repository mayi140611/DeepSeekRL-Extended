Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to determine how many people bought coffee. Fatima's restaurant served 25 people in total, and \( \frac{3}{5} \) of that number came to buy coffee. To find the number of people who bought coffee, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of people who bought coffee} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
\]

So, 15 people bought coffee. To find out how many people did not buy coffee, we subtract the number of people who bought coffee from the total number of visitors:

\[
\text{Number of people who did not buy coffee} = 25 - 15 = 10
\]

Therefore, 10 people did not buy coffee in the restaurant.

To determine how many people did not buy coffee, we start by calculating the number of people who did buy coffee. Given that 3/5 of the 25 people came to buy coffee, we can calculate this as follows:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
\]

So, 15 people bought coffee. Since the total number of people who visited the restaurant was 25, the number of people who did not buy coffee can be found by subtracting the number of people who bought coffee from the total number of people:

\[
25 - 15 = 10
\]

Therefore, 10 people did not buy coffee.

To determine how many people did not buy coffee, we first need to find out how many people came to buy coffee. We know that 3/5 of the 25 people who came to the restaurant came specifically to buy coffee. We can calculate this number by multiplying 25 by 3/5:

\[
25 \times \frac{3}{5} = 15
\]

So, 15 people bought coffee. 

Since a total of 25 people came to the restaurant, the number of people who did not buy coffee is the total number of visitors minus the number who bought coffee:

\[
25 - 15 = 10
\]

Therefore, 10 people did not buy coffee.

To find out how many people did not buy coffee in the restaurant, we start by determining how many people bought coffee. The problem states that three-fifths of the total number of people, which is 25, came to buy coffee. 

So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of people who bought coffee} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
\]

Next, we find the number of people who did not buy coffee:
\[
\text{Total number of people} - \text{Number of people who bought coffee} = 25 - 15 = 10
\]

Thus, 10 people did not buy coffee.

To find out how many people did not buy coffee, we need to first determine how many people came to buy coffee. We know that 3/5 of the total number of people bought coffee, and there were 25 people in total. So, we can calculate the number of people who bought coffee as follows:

\[ \text{Number of people who bought coffee} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 \]

\[ \text{Number of people who bought coffee} = 15 \]

To find out how many people did not buy coffee, we subtract the number of people who bought coffee from the total number of people served:

\[ \text{Number of people who did not buy coffee} = 25 - 15 \]

\[ \text{Number of people who did not buy coffee} = 10 \]

So, 10 people did not buy coffee in the restaurant.

To determine how many people did not buy coffee, we first need to calculate how many people came to buy coffee. Since 3/5 of the total 25 people came to buy coffee, we can find this number by calculating \( \frac{3}{5} \times 25 \).

\[ \text{Number of coffee buyers} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 \]

Next, we subtract the number of coffee buyers from the total number of visitors to find out how many did not buy coffee.

\[ \text{Number of people who did not buy coffee} = \text{Total visitors} - \text{Number of coffee buyers} \]

Let's calculate the number of coffee buyers:

\[ \text{Number of coffee buyers} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

Then we subtract this from the total number of visitors:

\[ \text{Number of people who did not buy coffee} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, 10 people did not buy coffee in the restaurant.

Let's denote the total number of people who came to the restaurant as \( P \). According to the information given, \( P = 25 \).

Next, we know that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total number of people came to buy coffee. So the number of people who bought coffee is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 25 \).

Calculating the number of people who bought coffee:  
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, to find out how many people did not buy coffee, we subtract the number of people who bought coffee from the total number of people:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of people who did not buy coffee is 10.

To determine how many people did not buy coffee, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of people who bought coffee.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of people served to find those who did not buy coffee.

Given:
- Total number of people served = 25
- Fraction of people who bought coffee = \( \frac{3}{5} \)

First, calculate the number of people who bought coffee:
\[ \text{Number of people who bought coffee} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = \frac{3 \times 25}{5} = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \]

Next, subtract the number of people who bought coffee from the total number of people served to find those who did not buy coffee:
\[ \text{Number of people who did not buy coffee} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, 10 people did not buy coffee in the restaurant.

To find out how many people did not buy coffee, we need to first calculate the number of people who came to buy coffee. Since 3/5 of the total number of people came to buy coffee, we can calculate this number by multiplying the total number of people by 3/5.

$$
\text{Number of people who bought coffee} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25
$$

Now, we can subtract the number of people who bought coffee from the total number of people to find out how many did not buy coffee.

$$
\text{Number of people who did not buy coffee} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Number of people who bought coffee}
$$

Let's calculate these values.

$$
\text{Number of people who bought coffee} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
