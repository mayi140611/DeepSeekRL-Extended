#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Lisa has a total of 10 minutes and she has eaten 20 hotdogs in halfway time, which means she still has 10/2 = 5 minutes left to eat the rest of the hotdogs.
To tie Joey Chestnut's record, Lisa has to eat 75 hotdogs, so she still needs to eat 75 - 20 = 55 hotdogs.
Since Lisa still has 5 minutes to eat 75 hotdogs, to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record she has to eat 55 / 5 = 11 hotdogs per minute.

Lisa needs to eat a total of 75 hotdogs, and she has already consumed 20 hotdogs. Therefore, she has 75 - 20 = 55 hot dogs left to consume.

Since she has 10 minutes to eat all the remaining hotdogs, she needs to consume a total of 55 hotdogs over 10 minutes. Therefore, she will have to eat 55/10 = 5.5 hotdogs per minute.

Lisa has 10 minutes before she needs to finish eating 75 hotdogs. So that's a total of 10 * 2 = 20 hot dogs halfway through. So she needs to eat 20-20= 10 more hot dogs in order to tie Joey Chestnut's record. That means she needs to eat 10/10 * 100% = 100%.

Lisa has to eat 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes. Halfway through, she has eaten 20 hotdogs. So, she has 10 - 5 = 5 minutes left to eat 55 hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnut's record. To find the number of hotdogs she has to eat per minute, we divide the number of hotdogs she has left to eat by the remaining minutes. So, 55 div 5 = 11 hotdogs per minute.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####

system
Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs halfway through the time, and her goal is to eat a total of 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes. This means she has 5 minutes left to eat the remaining hotdogs. To find out how many hotdogs she needs to eat per minute, we divide the remaining number of hotdogs by the remaining minutes.

20 hotdogs - Lisa has eaten so far = 55 hotdogs left to eat
5 minutes remaining = 55 hotdogs / 5 minutes = 11 hotdogs per minute

So, Lisa will have to eat 11 hotdogs per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record.

#### GENERATION 12 RESPONSE ####

system
To tie Joey Chestnut's record, Lisa needs to eat 75 hot dogs in 10 minutes. She has already eaten 20 hot dogs by halftime, so she needs to eat 75 - 20 = 55 hot dogs in the remaining 5 minutes.

To find out how many hot dogs she needs to eat per minute, we divide the number of hot dogs still needed by the remaining minutes:

55 hot dogs / 5 minutes = 11.0 hot dogs per minute.

Therefore, Lisa needs to eat at least 11.0 hot dogs per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record.

#### GENERATION 13 RESPONSE ####

system
To solve this, we need to calculate how many hotdogs Lisa needs to eat per minute to tie Joey Chestnut's record of 75 hotdogs eaten in 10 minutes. If half the time is already passed and Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs, then another 20 will need to be eaten. At the start of the contest, 20 hotdogs have already been eaten, so only 55 hotdogs remain. Lisa needs to eat these remaining hotdogs in the remaining 5 minutes to tie the record. Therefore, she needs 55 hotdogs / 5 minutes.

Lisa has a total of 10 minutes, so to tie Joey Chestnut's record she has to eat a total of 75 hotdogs. Halfway through the time Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs, so she has 5 min left to eat 55 hotdogs. If she needs to eat 55 hotdogs in 5 minutes and 20 hotdogs in 5 minutes already, this means she needs to eat 35 hotdogs per minute for the final 5 minutes to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record.

Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs halfway through the event. To tie Joey Chestnut's record, which is 75 hotdogs, she needs to eat \(75 - 20 = 55\) hotdogs. She has 5 minutes left to eat these hotdogs (since the event lasts for 10 minutes in total). Therefore, she needs to eat \( \frac{55}{5} = 11 \) hotdogs per minute.
