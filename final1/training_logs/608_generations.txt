system
Let's denote the amount Angie pays in taxes this month as \( T \).

Angie's total monthly expenses are $42 for necessities and $T for taxes. Since her salary is $80, we can write the equation for her remaining money after paying for necessities and taxes as:

\[ 80 - 42 - T = 18 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ 38 - T = 18 \]
\[ T = 38 - 18 \]
\[ T = 20 \]

So, Angie paid $20 in taxes this month.

To find out how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we can set up an equation to represent her financial situation.

Let's denote the amount she paid in taxes this month as \( T \).

We know the following:
- Angie's total salary is $80.
- Her contribution for necessities is $42.
- She had $18 left over after all expenses.

So, her expenses (including taxes) this month is equal to her salary minus what she has left over. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

\[ \text{Salary} - \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Left Over} \]
\[ 80 - (42 + T) = 18 \]

Let's solve this equation to find \( T \):

\[ 80 - 42 - T = 18 \]
\[ 38 - T = 18 \]
\[ T = 38 - 18 \]
\[ T = 20 \]

So, Angie paid $20 in taxes this month.

To find out how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we need to determine her total expenses and subtract her total income from it.

1. **Calculate Angie's total expenses:**
   - Monthly contribution for necessities: $42
   - $80 salary
   - Let's denote the amount paid in taxes this month as \( T \)

   So, Angie's total expenses are: \( 42 + 80 + T \).

2. **Calculate Angie's total income:**
   - Salary: $80

3. **Determine the amount left over after expenses:**
   - At the end of this month, Angie had $18 left over.
   - Therefore, her total expenses (\( 42 + 80 + T \)) should equal her total income plus her leftover money.

   So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   42 + 80 + T = 80 + 18
   \]

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   \[
   42 + 80 + T = 98
   \]
   \[
   122 + T = 98
   \]
   \[
   T = 98 - 122
   \]
   \[
   T = -24
   \]

   However, it seems there was a misinterpretation. Let's correct it:

   \[
   42 + 80 = 122
   \]
   \[
   122 + T = 98
   \]
   \[
   T = 98 - 122
   \]
   \[
   T = -24
   \]

   It appears the correct equation should be:
   \[
   122 + T = 98
   \]
   \[
   T = 98 - 122
   \]
   \[
   T = -24
   \]

   So, Angie paid $18 in taxes this month.

5. **Correcting the mistake in the previous reasoning:**

   - Total expenses: \( 42 + 80 = 122 \)
   - Total income: \( 80 \)
   - Leftover amount: \( 18 \)
   - Taxes paid this month: \( 122 - (80 - 18) = 122 - 62 = 60 \)

Thus, the correct amount Angie paid in taxes this month is $60.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
<answer>
60
</answer>
<reasoning>
Correctly calculated by setting up the equation with the correct values and solving for \( T \).

To find out how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we need to subtract her income and her contribution to necessities from her salary and the amount left over.

Angie's salary is $80 per month.
Her contribution to necessities is $42 per month.
She has $18 left over at the end of the month.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as her salary.
- \( N \) as her monthly contribution to necessities.
- \( T \) as the amount she pays in taxes each month.
- \( L \) as the amount left over at the end of the month.

We can write the equation for the amount left over as:
\[ S - N - T = L \]

Given:
\[ S = 80 \]
\[ N = 42 \]
\[ L = 18 \]

Substituting the known values into the equation:
\[ 80 - 42 - T = 18 \]

Now, calculate the total spent before taxes:
\[ 80 - 42 = 38 \]

So, we have:
\[ 38 - T = 18 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 38 - 18 \]
\[ T = 20 \]

Therefore, Angie paid $20 in taxes this month.

Let's denote the total amount Angie pays in taxes this month as \( T \).

Given:
- Angie's salary = $80 per month
- Amount contributed for necessities = $42 per month
- Amount left over at the end of the month = $18
- Taxes paid = \( T \)

To find out how much in taxes she paid, we need to determine her total expenses and expenses not covered by her salary. 

First, calculate her total expenses:
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \text{Salary} - \text{Amount left over} \]

\[ \text{Total expenses} = 80 - 18 = 62 \]

Angie's total expenses in this month include necessities and taxes. Therefore:
\[ \text{Necessities} + \text{Taxes} = 62 \]

Angie contributes $42 per month for necessities. So, we can find the taxes she paid by subtracting this amount from the total expenses:
\[ T = 62 - 42 \]

\[ T = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount Angie paid in taxes this month is $20.

To determine how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's calculate her total expenses for necessities and her salary.
2. Then, we'll subtract this total from her salary at the end of the month to find out how much she has left.
3. Finally, we'll use the information about the leftover amount to find out her tax payment.

Step 1: Calculate total expenses and salary at the end of the month.
Angie's salary is $80 per month. She saves $42 for necessities each month. Therefore, her total expenses (which include her salary and necessities) are:
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \text{Salary} + \text{Necessities} = 80 + 42 = 122 \]

Step 2: Determine the amount left after expenses and savings.
Angie had $18 left at the end of the month. This amount represents the leftover after all her expenses including necessities were accounted for. Let's denote the tax she paid this month as \( T \). According to the information given, her total expenses (salary and necessities) minus this tax should equal $18:
\[ 122 - T = 18 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( T \).
To find out the tax amount, we rearrange the equation to isolate \( T \):
\[ T = 122 - 18 = 104 \]

So, Angie paid $104 in taxes this month.

To find out how much Angie paid in taxes this month, let's follow these steps:

1. First, we need to calculate how much Angie spent in total this month. This includes her salary minus the amount she paid for necessities and the amount she had left over at the end of the month.
2. Next, we'll subtract the amount she paid for necessities and the amount she had left over at the end of the month from her total salary to find out how much she paid in taxes.

Given:
- Angie's salary = $80
- Amount contributed for necessities = $42
- Amount left over at the end of the month = $18

The calculation would be as follows:
- Total expenses = Angie's salary - Amount contributed for necessities
- Taxes paid = Total expenses - Amount left over at the end of the month

Let's plug this into our equation:

Total expenses = $80 - $42 = $38
Taxes paid = $38 - $18 = $20

Using the calculation from above, we can confirm that if we subtract the $42 for necessities and the $18 left over:
$80 - $42 - $18 = $20

Therefore, Angie paid $20 in taxes this month.

To find out how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we need to subtract the total of her expenses and savings from her salary.

First, let's calculate her total expenses. She contributes $42 to necessities and has $18 left over at the end of the month.

Expense: $42
Remaining: $18

Savings: $18 (remaining) - $42 (necessities) = -$24

Since her savings are negative, it means she spent more than she earned. This suggests that she might have had an additional expense or a shortfall in her savings.

Now, let's calculate her total expenses:

Expense: $42
Savings: -$24
Total expenses: $42 - $24 = $18

Angie's total expenses this month were $18. To find out how much she paid in taxes, we need to know her total salary and subtract her total expenses, as well as her savings.

Total salary: $80
Total expenses: $18
Savings: -$24

Total expenses and savings: $18 - $24 = -$6

This negative number indicates that her total expenses were higher than her salary and savings for the month. Therefore, she must have owed an additional $6 tax this month to cover the difference between her salary and expenses.

However, since we are calculating taxes only, let's assume that this $6 represents the tax amount that she paid this month. (If we interpret this $6 as a savings shortfall, then she did not pay any taxes this month.)

Therefore, Angie paid $6 in taxes this month.

The amount she paid in taxes is the difference between her total salary and the amount she has left after paying for necessities.

Tax amount paid = Total salary - Amount left over

1. Angie's contribution to the household for necessities is $42.
2. Angie's salary is $80.
3. She had $18 left over at the end of the month, which means her total expenses for the month are the sum of her salary and necessity expenses minus the leftover amount.

To find out how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we can subtract her monthly contributions for necessities and her salary from her total monthly income. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. Angie's total monthly income is her salary plus her monthly contribution for necessities:
   $80 (salary) + $42 (necessities) = $122 (total monthly income)

2. At the end of the month, she had $18 left over, meaning she spent the rest:
   $122 (total monthly income) - $18 (remaining) = $104 (amount spent)

3. This $104 represents the total amount she paid in taxes and her share of the household taxes. Since we know she contributed $42 a month for necessities, we subtract this from the total amount spent to find the taxes she paid:

   $104 - $42 = $62 (taxes paid by Angie this month)

To determine how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we need to account for all her expenses and her remaining funds.

1. Identify Angie's monthly salary: $80.
2. Identify the amount she contributed to necessities: $42.
3. Let \( T \) be the amount she paid in taxes this month.
4. At the end of the month, she had $18 left over.

First, we calculate her total monthly expenses:
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \text{Salary} - \text{Necessities} + \text{Taxes} \]
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 80 - 42 + T = 38 + T \]

Since she had $18 left over at the end of the month, we can write the equation:
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 38 + T \]
\[ 38 + T = 18 \]

Now, solve for \( T \):
\[ T = 18 - 38 \]
\[ T = -20 \]

Since taxes cannot be negative, we recheck our understanding. The amount she had left over should actually be greater than her taxes, so there seems to be a miscalculation or an error in the problem statement. However, based on the given scenario, if we assume there is no mistake in the problem statement, the amount she paid in taxes should be the negative of what we found, which is actually a misunderstanding. Since taxes cannot be negative, we must conclude there's an error in the problem setup or the interpretation. 

Given this, the correct amount Angie paid in taxes is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]

However, the negative calculation process indicates there's an error in the problem setup or interpretation. If we recheck the steps, it appears that the correct interpretation should be that Sarah has a loss of $20 in taxes, which means she should be receiving a tax deduction, not paying taxes. The correct scenario should be rechecked for accuracy. 

Thus, the correct interpretation should be:
\[ \boxed{20} \]

This indicates there is an error in the problem setup or interpretation, and it is not possible for someone to have a positive tax payment if their salary and necessities are less than her remaining funds. 

Therefore, the correct understanding should be:
\[ \boxed{20} \]

This indicates there is an error in the problem setup or interpretation, and it is not possible for someone to have a positive tax payment if their salary and necessities are less than her remaining funds.
