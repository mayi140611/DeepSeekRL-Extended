system
To determine how many square tables are needed to seat 90 pupils, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of seats from the rectangular tables:**
   - Each rectangular table seats 10 pupils.
   - There are 7 rectangular tables.
   \[
   7 \times 10 = 70 \text{ seats}
   \]
   So, the 7 rectangular tables seat 70 pupils.

2. **Determine the number of seats remaining to be filled:**
   - There are 90 pupils in total.
   - The 70 seats from the rectangular tables are already occupied.
   \[
   90 - 70 = 20 \text{ seats remaining}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of square tables needed:**
   - Each square table seats 4 pupils.
   - We need 20 more seats to accommodate 90 pupils.
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ square tables}
   \]

Therefore, 5 square tables are needed so that 90 pupils can read at the same time.

Let \( x \) be the number of square tables needed.

Each square table seats 4 pupils, and each rectangular table seats 10 pupils. We need a total of 90 pupils seated.

The equation representing this scenario is:
\[ 4x \text{ (pupils from square tables)} + 10(7) \text{ (pupils from rectangular tables)} = 90 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4x + 70 = 90 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 20 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 square tables are needed to seat 90 pupils.

To find out how many square tables are needed, we first calculate the total seating capacity of rectangular tables:

\[
7 \text{ rectangular tables} \times 10 \text{ pupils/rectangular table} = 70 \text{ pupils}
\]

Next, we subtract the seating capacity of rectangular tables from the total number of pupils to find out how many pupils need to be seated by square tables:

\[
90 \text{ pupils} - 70 \text{ pupils} = 20 \text{ pupils}
\]

Since each square table seats 4 pupils, we can determine the number of square tables needed by dividing the remaining pupils by the capacity of a square table:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ pupils}}{4 \text{ pupils/square table}} = 5 \text{ square tables}
\]

So, 5 square tables are needed in order to seat 90 pupils.

To solve this problem, let's start with the information given:

- The library has 7 rectangular tables.
- Each rectangular table seats 10 pupils.
- Each square table seats 4 pupils.
- We need to seat 90 pupils in total.

First, calculate the total number of pupils that can be seated at the rectangular tables:

\[ 7 \text{ tables} \times 10 \text{ pupils/table} = 70 \text{ pupils} \]

Next, subtract the number of pupils that can be seated at the rectangular tables from the total number of pupils to find out how many pupils need to be seated at the square tables:

\[ 90 \text{ pupils} - 70 \text{ pupils} = 20 \text{ pupils} \]

Now, calculate the number of square tables required to seat the remaining 20 pupils, knowing that each square table seats 4 pupils:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ pupils}}{4 \text{ pupils/table}} = 5 \text{ tables} \]

So, 5 square tables are needed.

To determine how many square tables are needed, we start by analyzing the seating capacity at the rectangular tables.

A rectangular table seats 10 pupils. If all 7 rectangular tables are used, the total number of pupils seated at rectangular tables would be:
\[ 7 \times 10 = 70 \text{ pupils} \]

We need to accommodate 90 pupils in total. To find out how many additional pupils can be seated with the square tables, we subtract the students already seated at rectangular tables from the total number of students:
\[ 90 - 70 = 20 \text{ pupils} \]

Each square table seats 4 pupils. To find out how many square tables are needed to seat 20 pupils, we divide the number of additional pupils by the seating capacity of a square table:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

Therefore, 5 square tables are needed.

To determine the number of square tables needed, we start by calculating the total seating capacity of the rectangular tables.

Number of rectangular tables = 7

Seating capacity per rectangular table = 10

Total seating capacity of rectangular tables = 7 * 10 = 70

Number of pupils to be seated = 90

Pupils without a rectangular table = 90 - 70 = 20

Number of square tables required = Pupils without a rectangular table / Seating capacity per square table

Number of square tables required = 20 / 4 = 5

Therefore, 5 square tables are needed.

Let's denote the number of square tables needed as \( x \).

The library already has 7 rectangular tables, each seating 10 pupils, so these tables seat \( 7 \times 10 = 70 \) pupils.

The remaining seats need to be filled with square tables, seating 4 pupils each. Since we need to seat 90 pupils in total, the number of seats from the square tables will be \( 90 - 70 = 20 \) seats.

Each square table seats 4 pupils, so the number of square tables needed to seat 20 pupils is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \).

Therefore, 5 square tables are needed.

Currently, the library has 7 rectangular tables and 1 square table.

A rectangular table seats 10 pupils and a square table seats 4 pupils. 

Let's calculate the total capacity of the rectangular tables first:
7 tables * 10 pupils/table = 70 pupils

Now, we need to accommodate 90 pupils in total. We've already allocated 70 pupils to the rectangular tables, so we need to find out how many more pupils need to be seated. 

90 pupils in total - 70 pupils (reserved for rectangular tables) = 20 pupils left to seat.

Now, we want to use square tables to seat the remaining pupils. Each square table seats 4 pupils.

We divide the number of needed pupils by the number of pupils each square table seats to find out the minimum number of square tables needed.

20 pupils / 4 pupils/table = 5 square tables

So, 5 square tables are needed along with the 7 rectangular tables to seat 90 pupils simultaneously.

Let's denote the number of square tables as \( x \).

From the problem, we know that each rectangular table seats 10 pupils, and each square table also seats 4 pupils. Given that there are 7 rectangular tables already, we have \( 7 \times 10 = 70 \) pupils seated already.

The total number of pupils that need to be seated is 90 pupils. Therefore, the number of additional pupils that need to be seated is \( 90 - 70 = 20 \) pupils.

Each square table can seat 4 pupils, so to seat the remaining 20 pupils, we divide the number of additional pupils by the number each square table can seat:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Thus, we need 5 square tables to accommodate the remaining 20 pupils.

To summarize, for a total of 70 pupils seated already and the remaining 20 pupils needing seats, with each square table seating 4 pupils, we need 5 square tables.
