###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

With one mighty blow, Maria cracked open the pinata, and candies spilled all over the floor.  There were 40 red candies, 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies, and half as many blue candies as yellow candies.  If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?

<reasoning>
To determine how many candies remained after Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, we need to first figure out how many yellow, red, and blue candies there were in total, excluding the yellow ones that Carlos ate.

1. **Red candies**:
   Maria initially had 40 red candies.

2. **Yellow candies**:
   There were 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies. So, if we let \( R \) represent the number of red candies and \( Y \) represent the number of yellow candies, we have:
   \[
   R = 40
   \]
   \[
   Y = 3R - 20
   \]
   Substituting \( R \) with 40:
   \[
   Y = 3(40) - 20 = 120 - 20 = 100
   \]

3. **Blue candies**:
   There were half as many blue candies as yellow candies. So, if \( B \) represents the number of blue candies, we have:
   \[
   B = \frac{Y}{2}
   \]
   Substituting \( Y \) with 100:
   \[
   B = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

4. **Total candies remaining**:
   Sum up all the candies excluding the yellow ones that Carlos ate:
   \[
   R \text{ (red)} + B \text{ (blue)} = 40 + 50 = 90
   \]

Therefore, the total number of candies remaining is 90.

First, let's determine the number of yellow candies. The problem states that the number of yellow candies is 20 less than three times as many as red candies. With 40 red candies, we can calculate the number of yellow candies as follows:

1. Calculate three times the number of red candies:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120
   \]

2. Subtract 20 from this amount to find the number of yellow candies:
   \[
   120 - 20 = 100
   \]

So, there are 100 yellow candies.

Next, let's find out the number of blue candies. The problem says there are half as many blue candies as yellow candies:

1. Find half the number of yellow candies:
   \[
   \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

So, there are 50 blue candies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candies before Carlos ate any: 
\[
40 \text{ (red)} + 100 \text{ (yellow)} + 50 \text{ (blue)} = 190 \text{ candies}
\]

If Carlos ate all the yellow candies, then we need to subtract the number of yellow candies from the total number of candies:

1. Subtract the 100 yellow candies from the total:
   \[
   190 - 100 = 90
   \]

Therefore, the number of candies remaining is 90.

First, we need to determine the number of yellow candies. Since there are 40 red candies and there are 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies, we can calculate the number of yellow candies as follows:
\[ \text{Number of yellow candies} = 3 \times \text{Number of red candies} - 20 = 3 \times 40 - 20 = 120 - 20 = 100 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of blue candies. Since there are half as many blue candies as yellow candies, we can calculate the number of blue candies as follows:
\[ \text{Number of blue candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of yellow candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of candies remaining after Carlos ate all of the yellow candies. The total number of candies before Carlos ate any is the sum of the red, yellow, and blue candies:
\[ \text{Total candies} = \text{Number of red candies} + \text{Number of yellow candies} + \text{Number of blue candies} = 40 + 100 + 50 = 190 \]

Since Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, the number of candies remaining is the sum of the red and blue candies:
\[ \text{Candies remaining} = \text{Number of red candies} + \text{Number of blue candies} = 40 + 50 = 90 \]

Therefore, the number of candies that remained is 90.

To determine how many candies remain after Carlos eats all of the yellow candies, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of red candies**: Maria has 40 red candies.
2. **Calculate the number of yellow candies**: Maria has 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies. Since there are 40 red candies, three times that amount is \(3 \times 40 = 120\). Therefore, the number of yellow candies is \(120 - 20 = 100\).
3. **Calculate the number of blue candies**: Maria has half as many blue candies as yellow candies. Since there are 100 yellow candies, half of that is \(100 / 2 = 50\). Therefore, there are 50 blue candies.
4. **Calculate the total number of candies initially**: The total number of candies is the sum of the red, yellow, and blue candies. This is \(40 + 100 + 50 = 190\).
5. **Determine the number of candies remaining after Carlos eats all the yellow candies**: Since Carlos ate all 100 yellow candies, the remaining number of candies is \(190 - 100 = 90\).

Therefore, the number of candies that remained is 90.

First, we need to find out how many yellow candies there are. We know there are 20 red candies and that the number of yellow candies is 3 times the number of red candies minus 20. So, if we let the number of yellow candies be \( y \), we have:
\[ y = 3 \times 40 - 20 \]
\[ y = 120 - 20 \]
\[ y = 100 \]

So there are 100 yellow candies.

Next, we find out how many blue candies there are. Since there are half as many blue candies as yellow candies, and there are 100 yellow candies, we have:
\[ b = \frac{100}{2} \]
\[ b = 50 \]

So there are 50 blue candies.

Now we can sum up all the candies:
\[ 40 \text{ (red)} + 100 \text{ (yellow)} + 50 \text{ (blue)} = 190 \]

Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, so only the red and blue candies remain.
Now we just need to figure out how many are left:
\[ 40 \text{ (red)} + 50 \text{ (blue)} = 90 \]

So, Carlos ate all the yellow candies and there are 90 candies left.

   \]

2. **Calculate the number of yellow candies:**
   \[

To determine how many candies remain after Carlos eats all the yellow candies, we first need to calculate the number of each type of candy:

1. **Red Candies:** Given directly as 40 red candies.
2. **Yellow Candies:** 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies. 

   Calculate three times the number of red candies:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120
   \]
   Subtract 20 from this result:
   \[
   120 - 20 = 100
   \]

   So, there are 100 yellow candies.

3. **Blue Candies:** Half as many blue candies as yellow candies.

   Calculate half of the number of yellow candies:
   \[
   \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

   So, there are 50 blue candies.

Next, we calculate the total number of candies initially:
\[
40 \text{ (red)} + 100 \text{ (yellow)} + 50 \text{ (blue)} = 190
\]

Since Carlos ate all the yellow candies, the remaining candies are:
\[
40 \text{ (red)} + 0 \text{ (yellow)} + 50 \text{ (blue)} = 90
\]

Thus, 90 candies remain.

Since there are 40 red candies, three times as many yellow candies would be \(3 \times 40 = 120\). Therefore, the number of yellow candies is \(120 - 20 = 100\).

Next, we calculate the number of blue candies. The problem states that there are half as many blue candies as yellow candies. Since there are 100 yellow candies, half of that number is \(100 / 2 = 50\) blue candies.

Now we add up the remaining candies to find the total number of candies remaining after Carlos eats all the yellow candies:

Let \( y \) be the number of yellow candies.

Now we know the quantities of each type of candy:

Reasoning:

1. The number of red candies is given: 40.
2. Yellow candies: There are 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies.
   - \(3 \times 40 = 120\)
   - Therefore, yellow candies \(= 120 - 20 = 100\).
3. Blue candies: There are half as many blue candies as yellow candies.
   - Therefore, blue candies \(= \frac{100}{2} = 50\).
4. Total candies before Carlos eats: Red + Yellow + Blue
