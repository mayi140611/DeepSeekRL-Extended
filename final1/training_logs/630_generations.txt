Let's break down the information given:

1. Bom has 300 watermelon seeds.
2. Gwi has 40 more seeds than Bom.
3. Yeon has three times as many seeds as Gwi.

First, let's calculate how many seeds Gwi has:
Gwi = Bom + 40
Gwi = 300 + 40 = 340 seeds

Now, let's find out how many seeds Yeon has:
Yeon = 3 * Gwi
Yeon = 3 * 340 = 1020 seeds

Now, to find the total number of seeds they have together, we add up the seeds of Bom, Gwi, and Yeon:
Total seeds = Bom's seeds + Gwi's seeds + Yeon's seeds
Total seeds = 300 + 340 + 1020
Total seeds = 1660 seeds

So they have a total of 1660 seeds together.

</answer>  
<reasoning>
First, we determined the number of seeds each person has through deductions from the given data. Since we know Bom's count and the differences in numbers for Gwi and Yeon, we can add up their seeds to get the total. Gwi had 340 seeds and Yeon had three times the number of Gwi's seeds, which means Yeon has 10,200 seeds. Now we simply add up all the numbers to get the total: 10,200 + 340 + 300 = 16,600 seeds.

Let's denote the number of watermelon seeds that Yeon has as \( Y \), Gwi has as \( G \), and Bom has as \( B \). We know from the problem that Bom has 300 watermelon seeds, so \( B = 300 \).

First, we know that Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom:
\[ G = B + 40 \]
Substituting \( B = 300 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ G = 300 + 40 = 340 \]

Next, we know that Yeon has three times as many watermelon seeds as Gwi:
\[ Y = 3G \]
Since \( G = 340 \), we have:
\[ Y = 3 \times 340 = 1020 \]

Now, we need to find out the total number of seeds they have together:
\[ Y + G + B = 1020 + 340 + 300 \]
Adding these numbers together, we get:
\[ 1020 + 340 + 300 = 1660 \]

So, the total number of seeds they have together is:
\[ \boxed{1660} \]

Let's break down the information given:

1. Bom has 300 watermelon seeds.

2. Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom. So, Gwi has:
   300 seeds + 40 seeds = 340 seeds.

3. Yeon has three times as many watermelon seeds as Gwi. So, Yeon has:
   3 Ã— 340 seeds = 1020 seeds.

Now, to find out how many seeds they have together, we add up all the seeds:
Bom's seeds + Gwi's seeds + Yeon's seeds = 300 + 340 + 1020 = 1660 seeds.

Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. We are given that Bom has 300 watermelon seeds. This is our starting point.
2. Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom. So, we can find out how many seeds Gwi has by adding 40 to Bom's seeds:
   Gwi's seeds = Bom's seeds + 40 = 300 seeds + 40 = 340 seeds.
3. We are told that Yeon has three times as many watermelon seeds as Gwi. So, we can calculate the number of seeds Yeon has by multiplying Gwi's seeds by 3:
   Yeon's seeds = 3 * Gwi's seeds = 3 * 340 = 1020 seeds.
4. To find out how many seeds they have together, we add the seeds of Bom, Gwi, and Yeon:
   Combined seeds = Bom's seeds + Gwi's seeds + Yeon's seeds = 300 seeds + 340 seeds + 1020 seeds.

Therefore, we get the total number of seeds:
Combined seeds = 300 + 340 + 1020 = 1660 seeds.

We need to determine the total number of watermelon seeds that Yeon, Gwi, and Bom have together.

1. Given that Bom has 300 seeds.
2. Gwi has 40 more seeds than Bom. 
   - Therefore, Gwi has \( 300 + 40 = 340 \) seeds.

3. Yeon has three times as many seeds as Gwi.
   - Therefore, Yeon has \( 3 \times 340 = 1020 \) seeds.

4. Now, let's find the total number of seeds they have together.
   - Bom has 300 seeds.
   - Gwi has 340 seeds.
   - Yeon has 1020 seeds.

Total seeds = Bom's seeds + Gwi's seeds + Yeon's seeds
             = 300 + 340 + 1020 = 1660

5. Therefore, their total number of seeds is 1660.

To find out how many watermelon seeds Yeon, Gwi, and Bom have together, we'll first calculate how many seeds each of them has individually based on the given information.

1. Bom has 300 watermelon seeds, as given in the problem.

2. We are told that Yeon has three times as many watermelon seeds as Gwi. Let's denote the number of watermelon seeds Gwi has as \( G \).

3. Since Bom has 300 watermelon seeds, Gwi has \( G \) seeds. According to the problem, \( G = 300 + 40 \) because Gwi has 40 more seeds than Bom.

   Therefore:
   \[ G = 300 + 40 = 340 \]

4. Yeon has three times as many seeds as Gwi, so Yeon's seeds count \( Y \) is:
   
   \[ Y = 3 \times G = 3 \times 340 = 1020 \]

5. Now, to find out the total number of seeds they have together, we add the seeds the three of them have:

   \[ \text{Total seeds} = 300 + 340 + 1020 \]

6. Calculating the total:
   
   \[ 300 + 340 + 1020 = 1660 \]

Therefore, they together have 1660 watermelon seeds.

Let's denote the number of watermelon seeds each person has:
- Let \( B \) be the number of seeds Bom has.
- Let \( G \) be the number of seeds Gwi has.
- Let \( Y \) be the number of seeds Yeon has.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = 300 \) (Bom has 300 seeds)
2. \( G = B + 40 \) (Gwi has 40 more seeds than Bom)
3. \( Y = 3G \) (Yeon has three times as many seeds as Gwi)

First, we need to find the number of seeds Gwi has. Since \( G = B + 40 \), we substitute \( B = 300 \):

\[
G = 300 + 40 = 340
\]

Next, we need to find the number of seeds Yeon has. Since \( Y = 3G \), we substitute \( G = 340 \):

\[
Y = 3 \times 340 = 1020
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of seeds they all have together. We sum the seeds of Bom, Gwi, and Yeon:

\[
B + G + Y = 300 + 340 + 1020
\]

Perform the addition:

\[
300 + 340 = 640
\]
\[
640 + 1020 = 1660
\]

So, the total number of seeds they have together is:

First, we know that Bom has 300 watermelon seeds. We can represent this as:
\[ \text{Bom's seeds} = 300 \]

Next, we know that Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom. Therefore, we can calculate the number of seeds Gwi has as follows:
\[ \text{Gwi's seeds} = \text{Bom's seeds} + 40 = 300 + 40 = 340 \]

We also know that Yeon has three times as many watermelon seeds as Gwi. Therefore, we can calculate the number of seeds Yeon has as follows:
\[ \text{Yeon's seeds} = 3 \times \text{Gwi's seeds} = 3 \times 340 = 1020 \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds they all have together, we add the seeds of Bom, Gwi, and Yeon:
\[ \text{Total seeds} = \text{Bom's seeds} + \text{Gwi's seeds} + \text{Yeon's seeds} = 300 + 340 + 1020 = 1660 \]

To find out how many watermelon seeds they have together, we need to calculate the number of seeds each of them has and then sum those amounts.

First, let's determine the number of seeds Gwi has. Since Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom, and Bom has 300 seeds:

\[
\text{Gwi's seeds} = \text{Bom's seeds} + 40 = 300 + 40 = 340

Let's start by finding out how many watermelon seeds Gwi has.

Given:

Since Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom, we can calculate the number of seeds Gwi has as follows:
