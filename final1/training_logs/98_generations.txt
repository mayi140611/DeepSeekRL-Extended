###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Hector purchased a container of gumballs.  He gave 4 to Todd, then he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha, and then he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha.  If Hector had 6 gumballs remaining, what is the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let G be the total number of gumballs Hector purchased, Gumballs given to Todd = 4,
Gumballs given to Alisha = 2 * 4 = 8,
Gumballs given to Bobby = 8 - 5 = 3,

Therefore, the equation G = 4 + 8 + 3 = 15 + 3 = 18,

Thus, the answer is 18.

system
Let's denote the number of gumballs Hector initially purchased as \( G \). According to the problem, Hector gave different amounts of gumballs to Todd, Alisha, and Bobby.

1. Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd.
2. Hector gave twice as many gumballs to Alisha as he had given Todd, which means he gave \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) gumballs to Alisha.
3. Hector gave 5 less than four times as many gumballs to Bobby as he had given Alisha. Therefore, he gave \( 4 \times 8 - 5 = 32 - 5 = 27 \) gumballs to Bobby.

After giving gumballs to Todd, Alisha, and Bobby, Hector had 6 gumballs remaining. We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of gumballs Hector initially had:

\[ G = 4 + 8 + 27 + 6 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of gumballs Hector had initially:

\[ G = 4 + 8 + 27 + 6 = 45 \]

So, the total number of gumballs Hector purchased is \( 45 \).

He gave Todd 4, and that was twice what he gave Alisha, so Alisha received 2, and then gave Bobby 4*2-5 = 3 gumballs.

Hector initially gave away 4+2+3 = 9 gumballs

If he had 6 gumballs remaining and initially gave away 9, he initially purchased 6+9 = 15 gumballs.

He gave 4 * 2 = 8 gumballs to Alisha. Then he gave 4 * 8 - 5 = 31 gumballs to Bobby. So he was left with 6 + 4 + 8 + 31 = 55 gumballs.

Let's denote the initial number of gumballs Hector purchased as \( x \).

1. **First, he gave 4 gumballs to Todd.**
   Hector now has \( x - 4 \) gumballs left.

2. **Then, he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha.**
   Hector gave \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) gumballs to Alisha. Hector now has \( x - 4 - 8 = x - 12 \) gumballs left.

3. **Next, he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha.**
   Hector gave \( 4 \times 8 - 5 = 32 - 5 = 27 \) gumballs to Bobby. Hector now has \( x - 12 - 27 = x - 39 \) gumballs left.

4. **We are told that Hector had 6 gumballs remaining.**
   Therefore, \( x - 39 = 6 \).

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x - 39 = 6 \implies x = 6 + 39 \implies x = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased is \( \boxed{45} \).

Let's denote the total number of gumballs Hector purchased as \( x \).

According to the problem:
1. Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd.
2. Hector gave twice as many as he had given to Todd, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) gumballs to Alisha.
3. Hector gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha, which is \( 4 \times 8 - 5 = 32 - 5 = 27 \) gumballs to Bobby.

After giving gumballs to Todd, Alisha, and Bobby, Hector had 6 gumballs remaining. So, the total number of gumballs given away is \( 4 + 8 + 27 = 39 \).

Since Hector started with \( x \) gumballs and ended with 6 gumballs, we can set up the equation:
\[ x - 39 = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 + 39 \]
\[ x = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased is 45.

He gave 4 to Todd, twice the amount to Alisha which means 2*4=8 gumballs.
Then he gave 5 less gumballs than four times as many to Bobby as he had given Alisha. If he gave twelve gumballs to Alisha, then he gave 5+4*12=53.
If we add up how many were given to Todd, Alisha and Bobby, we get 4+8+53=65 gumballs.

Let's denote the number of gumballs Hector initially had as \( x \).

1. **Hector gives gumballs to Todd**: Hector gives 4 gumballs to Todd.
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining gumballs after giving to Todd} = x - 4
   \]

2. **Hector gives gumballs to Alisha**: Hector gives twice as many gumballs to Alisha as he gave to Todd. Hence:
   
   \[
   \text{Gumballs given to Alisha} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining gumballs after giving to Alisha} = x - 4 - 8 = x - 12
   \]

3. **Hector gives gumballs to Bobby**: Hector gives 5 less than four times as many gumballs to Bobby as he gave to Alisha. Hence:
   
   \[
   \text{Gumballs given to Bobby} = 4 \times 8 - 5 = 32 - 5 = 27
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining gumballs after giving to Bobby} = x - 12 - 27 = x - 39
   \]

4. **Hector has 6 gumballs remaining**: 

   \[
   x - 39 = 6
   \]
   
   Solving for \( x \):

   \[
   x = 6 + 39 = 45
   \]

Hence, Hector initially purchased **45 gumballs**.
