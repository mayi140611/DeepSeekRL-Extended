#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
In a year, there are 52 Saturdays and 52 Sundays. On Saturdays, Harrison spends $3.50 on a regular croissant.

So for the week:

52 Saturdays * $3.50 = $182

On Sundays, Harrison spends $5.50 on an almond croissant.

So for the week:

52 Sundays * $5.50 = $286

Now, to calculate the total amount he spends on croissants in a year, we add the amounts from both days:

Total amount = $182 (on Saturdays) + $286 (on Sundays)

Total amount = $468

To calculate the total amount Harrison spends on croissants in a year, we need to consider the number of days he buys croissants and the cost per day.

First, let's find out how many Saturdays and Sundays are in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
  So, 52 * 1 = 52 Saturdays.

- There are 52 weeks in a year.
  So, 52 * 1 = 52 Sundays.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for Saturdays and Sundays separately:

1. For Saturdays:
    There are 52 Saturdays per year,
    and each croissant costs $3.50,

So, the cost for Saturdays is:
52 * $3.50 = $182.

2. For Sundays:
    There are 52 Sundays per year,
    and each croissant costs $5.50,

So, the cost for Sundays is:
52 * $5.50 = $296.

Finally, to get the total cost for the year, we add the two amounts together:
$182 + $296 = $478.

Therefore, Harrison spends $478 on croissants in a year.

To calculate the total amount Harrison spends on croissants in a year, we need to first determine the cost of his weekly purchases.

1. Cost of a regular croissant: $3.50
2. Cost of an almond croissant: $5.50

Since Harrison buys one regular croissant on Saturdays and one almond croissant on Sundays, his total weekly expenditure is the sum of these two costs.

Calculation:
$3.50 (regular croissant) + $5.50 (almond croissant) = $9.00 per week

Now, to find out how much Harrison spends in a year, we multiply his weekly expenditure by the number of weeks in a year.

Number of weeks in a year: 52

Calculation:
$9.00 per week × 52 weeks = $468

Therefore, Harrison spends £468 on croissants in a year.

First, determine the cost of the croissants Harrison buys in a year. He buys a regular croissant for $3.50 on Saturdays and an almond croissant for $5.50 on Sundays. Therefore, the total cost for each type of croissant per week is as follows:

- For Saturdays: \$3.50
- For Sundays: \$5.50

Now calculate the total cost for croissants in one week:

- Regular croissants on Saturdays = \$3.50
- Almond croissants on Sundays = \$5.50

$3.50 + \$5.50 = \$9.00

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, calculate the cost of croissants for a year:

- Cost per week = \$9.00
- Cost for a year = \$9.00 × 52 = \$468.00

So, Harrison spends \$468.00 on croissants in a year.

To find out how much Harrison spends on croissants in a year, we need to consider the number of Saturdays and Sundays in a year.

On each Saturday, he buys a croissant for $3.50. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, that's 52 Saturdays. So, the total cost for Saturdays in a year is:
\[ 52 \text{ Saturdays} \times \$3.50 \text{ per Saturday} \]

On each Sunday, he buys a croissant for $5.50. Since there are 52 Sundays in a year, that's 52 Sundays. So, the total cost for Sundays in a year is:
\[ 52 \text{ Sundays} \times \$5.50 \text{ per Sunday} \]

Adding these two amounts together will give us the total cost for a year:
\[ (52 \times \$3.50) + (52 \times \$5.50) \]

Now, let's do the math:
\[ 52 \times 3.50 = \$182 \]
\[ 52 \times 5.50 = \$286 \]
\[ \$182 + \$286 = \$468 \]

Therefore, Harrison spends \$468 on croissants in a year.

To calculate how much Harrison spends on croissants in a year, we need to consider the number of Saturdays and Sundays he gets croissants during the year.

1. There are exactly 52 weeks in a year.
2. Therefore, Harrison buys croissants on Saturdays for 52 Saturdays and Sundays for 52 Sundays.

Now, we will calculate the yearly spending for each type of croissant:

1. For the regular croissant:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one regular croissant} = \$3.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of regular croissants bought per year} = 52
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for regular croissants} = \$3.50 \times 52 = \$182
   \]

2. For the almond croissant:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one almond croissant} = \$5.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of almond croissants bought per year} = 52
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for almond croissants} = \$5.50 \times 52 = \$286
   \]

Next, we add the total costs for regular croissants and almond croissants to get the yearly expenditure for croissants:

\[
\text{Yearly expenditure on regular croissants} = \$182
\]
\[
\text{Yearly expenditure on almond croissants} = \$286
\]

\[
\text{Total yearly expenditure} = \$182 + \$286 = \$468
\]

Therefore, Harrison spends a total of \$468 on croissants in a year.

To determine the total amount Harrison spends on croissants in a year, we need to consider his spending on croissants on both Saturdays and Sundays.

1. **Calculate the weekly spending:**
   - On Saturdays: Harrison buys a regular croissant for $3.50.
   - On Sundays: Harrison buys an almond croissant for $5.50.
   - Total weekly spending: \(3.50 + 5.50 = 9.00\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the annual spending:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total annual spending is \(9.00 \times 52 = 468\) dollars.

3. **Determine the number of Saturdays and Sundays in a year:**
   - There are 52 Saturdays in a year since there is one on every Saturday.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on Saturdays:**
   - Each Saturday, Harrison spends $3.50, so for 52 Saturdays, he spends \(3.50 \times 52 = 182\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on Sundays:**
   - Each Sunday, Harrison spends $5.50, so for 52 Sundays, he spends \(5.50 \times 52 = 286\) dollars.

6. **Sum the total annual spending on Saturdays and Sundays:**
   - Total annual spending on Saturdays: $182
   - Total annual spending on Sundays: $286
   - Total annual spending on croissants: \(182 + 286 = 468\) dollars.

**Conclusion:**
Harrison spends a total of $468 on croissants in a year.

To determine how much Harrison spends on croissants in a year, we need to calculate the cost of each type of croissant and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost for regular croissants and almond croissants:
- Regular croissant: $3.50 per croissant
- Almond croissant: $5.50 per croissant

Since Harrison buys a regular croissant on Saturdays and an almond croissant on Sundays, we need to consider only those days for the weekly cost.

Weekly cost:
- Number of Saturdays in a year: 52
- Number of Sundays in a year: 52

Weekly cost per croissant type:
- Regular croissant: 52 $3.50 = $182
- Almond croissant: 52 $5.50 = $286

Total monthly cost:
Total monthly cost = Weekly cost for regular croissant + Weekly cost for almond croissant
Total monthly cost = $182 + $286 = $468

Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to calculate the total annual cost:
Total annual cost = Monthly cost × 12
Total annual cost = $468 × 12 = $5,616

Therefore, Harrison spends $5,616 on croissants in a year.

To calculate the amount he spends on croissants in a year, we need to determine the number of Saturdays and Sundays in a year and multiply these by the corresponding prices. There are 52 weeks in a year, and in each week, there are 1 Saturday and 1 Sunday.

Number of Saturdays = 52
Number of Sundays = 52

Now, we calculate the total amount spent each week:
Saturday: $3.50
Sunday: $5.50

Total spent per week = $3.50 + $5.50 = $9.00

Total spent in a year = Number of Saturdays * Price of Saturday croissant + Number of Sundays * Price of Sunday croissant
Total spent in a year = 52 * $3.50 + 52 * $5.50

Let's calculate this:

$3.50 / $3.50 = 1
Total spent on Saturday croissants = 52 * 1 = $52.00

$5.50 / $5.50 = 1
Total spent on Sunday croissants = 52 * 1 = $52.00

Total spent in a year = $52.00 + $52.00 = $104.00

To determine how much Harrison spends on croissants in a year, we need to consider the frequency of his purchases and the prices of the different types of croissants.

1. **Saturday Purchase:**
   - Harrison buys a regular croissant for $3.50.
   - This purchase happens only on Saturdays.

2. **Sundays Purchase:**
   - Harrison buys an almond croissant for $5.50.
   - This purchase happens only on Sundays.

3. **Calculation of Annual Spend:**
   - The number of Saturdays in a year is 52.
   - The number of Sundays in a year is 52.
   - Therefore, the total cost on Saturdays for yearly purchases is \( 52 \times $3.50 \).
   - The total cost on Sundays for yearly purchases is \( 52 \times $5.50 \).

4. **Total Annual Spending:**
   - Total spending on Saturdays:
     \[
     52 \times 3.50 = 182
     \]
   - Total spending on Sundays:
     \[
     52 \times 5.50 = 286
     \]
   - Summing these amounts gives the total annual spending:
     \[
     182 + 286 = 468
     \]

Thus, Harrison spends a total of $468 on croissants in a year.
