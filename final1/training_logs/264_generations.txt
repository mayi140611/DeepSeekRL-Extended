Daily earnings from weekdays: $600/day
Earnings on weekends: $600 * 2 = $1200/day
Total earnings for weekdays in a month (assuming 4 weeks): $600/week/day * 4 weeks * 6 days/week = $14400
Total earnings for weekends in a month (assuming 1 week): $1200/week/day * 7 days/week = $8400
Total monthly earnings: $14400 + $8400 = $22800

First, we need to calculate the daily earnings. 
- Weekdays: $600 * 5 = $3000
- Weekends: $600 * 2 * 2 = $2400
So in total for the week: $3000 + $2400 = $5400

Now take the sum of the earnings from a week, which equals the total for a month:

$5400 * 4 = $21600

Therefore, the answer is $21600.

The Italian restaurant earns $600 on each weekday, so the total earnings for weekdays is $600 \times 5 = $3,000. On the weekend, it earns twice as much, which is $600 \times 2 \times 2 = $2,400. So the total earnings for a month is $3,000 + $2,400 = $5,400.

To calculate the total earnings for the month, we need to first find out how much the restaurant earns on weekdays and weekends.

Weekday earnings = $600
Weekend earnings = $600 * 2 = $1200

Since there are typically 5 weekdays in a week and 1 weekend day, we can calculate the monthly earnings as follows:

Total weekday earnings = $600 * 5 * 4 (4 weeks in a month) = $12,000
Total weekend earnings = $1200 * 1 * 4 = $4,800

So, the total earnings by the end of the month is the sum of weekday and weekend earnings:
Total monthly earnings = $12,000 + $4,800 = $16,800

First, let's calculate the earnings for the weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, $600 is earned every weekday. That's $600 * 5 = $3000.

Now let's calculate the earnings for the weekends. Since there are 2 weekend days and the restaurant earns double the weekday rate, the earnings are $600 * 2 = $1200 each day. That's $1200 * 2 = $2400 earned on the weekend.

Finally, we can calculate the total monthly earnings by adding the weekday earnings to the weekend earnings. That's $3000 + $2400 = $5400.

The Italian restaurant earns $600 for each weekday, so the total earnings from the weekdays is 7 * $600 = $4200. The restaurant earns twice as much on the weekend, so the total earnings from the weekend is 2 * $600 = $1200. Adding the earnings from weekdays and weekend, the total amount earned by the end of the month is $4200 + $1200 = $5400.

Let's calculate the earnings each week:

Weekday earnings: $600/day * 5 days = $3000
Weekend earnings: $600/day * 2 days * 2 (weekend days) = $2400

Total weekly earnings: $3000 + $2400 = $5400

Assuming a month has 4 weeks:

Total monthly earnings: $5400/week * 4 weeks = $21600

Therefore, the restaurant earns $21600 by the end of the month.

First, let's calculate the earnings during the weekdays.

An Italian restaurant earns $600 every day during the weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, thus, the total earnings during weekdays can be calculated as:

\( 600 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \)

Now, let's calculate the earnings during the weekend.

The restaurant earns twice as much on the weekend, which means it earns \( 600 \times 2 = 1200 \) dollars each weekend day. There are 2 weekend days in a week and thus, the total earnings during the weekend can be calculated as:

\( 1200 \text{ dollars/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \)

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for the month.

The restaurant earns $3000 during weekdays and $2400 during the weekend. Therefore, the total earnings for one month (which has typically about 4 weeks) can be calculated as:

\( $3000 \text{ (weekdays)} + $2400 \text{ (weekend)} = $5400 \)

So, the total money earned by the end of the month is $5400.

On weekdays, the restaurant earns $600/day and there are 5 weekdays in a week, so the earnings for weekdays in a week are $600/weekday * 5 weekdays = $3000/week.

On weekends, the restaurant earns twice as much as on weekdays, so the earnings for weekends in a week are $600/weekday * 2 * 2 = $2400/week.

Therefore, the total earnings for the month would be the sum of the earnings for weekdays and the weekends, which is $3000/week * 4 weeks + $2400/week * 2 weeks = $3000/week * 6 weeks = $18000.
