The total sales for the store last month was 72 computers. Half of these are laptops, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 72 = 36 \) are laptops. One-third are netbooks, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 72 = 24 \) are netbooks. The remaining sales are desktop computers, so \( 72 - 36 - 24 = 12 \) are desktop computers.

Let's break it down:
Half of the sales are laptops, so she sold 72 * 1/2 = 36 laptops.
One-third of the sales are netbooks, so she sold 72 * 1/3 = 24 netbooks.
The rest are desktop computers, so:
72 - 36 - 24 = 12 desktop computers

Let's break it down:
1. Total computers sold = 72
2. Half are laptops = 72 / 2 = 36
3. One-third are netbooks = 72 / 3 = 24

Now, let's find out how many desktop computers there are:
Total - Laptops - Netbooks = Desktops
= 72 - 36 - 24
= 12

One-third of the total sales were netbooks, so 1/3 * 72 = 24 netbooks.
Half of the total sales were laptops, so 1/2 * 72 = 36 laptops.
The rest were desktop computers, so there are 72 - 24 - 36 = 12 desktop computers.

Mr. Lu's store sold a total of 72 computers as follows: half are laptops, one-third are netbooks, so the remainder are desktop computers.

We can say:
- Number of laptops = 1/2 * 72
- Number of netbooks = 1/3 * 72
- Number of desktop computers = Total computers - Number of laptops - Number of netbooks

The number of desktop computers can be calculated as follows:
- Number of laptops = 1/2 * 72 = 36
- Number of netbooks = 1/3 * 72 = 24
- Number of desktop computers = 72 - 36 - 24 = 12

The total percentage of laptops and netbooks is 50% + 33.33% = 83.33% of the total sales.
The percentage of desktop computers is 100% - 83.33% = 16.67% of the total sales.

To find the number of desktop computers sold, we need to calculate the total number sold for desktops which is 16.67% of 72.

<answer>
72 * (16.67/100) = 12

Mr. Lu's store is able to sell 1/2+1/3 = 5/6 of the total computers.

Let's calculate the number of laptops and netbooks first.

Half of the sales are laptops: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 72 = 36 \) laptops.

One-third of the sales are netbooks: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 72 = 24 \) netbooks.

Now, we add the number of laptops and netbooks:

\( 36 \) laptops + \( 24 \) netbooks = \( 60 \) laptops and netbooks combined.

Subtracting this from the total sales gives the number of desktop computers:

Total sales - (Laptops + Netbooks) = Desktop computers

\( 72 - 60 = 12 \) desktop computers.

Let's denote the total number of computers sold as \( T \). According to the problem, \( T = 72 \).

Half of the sales are laptops, so:
\[ \text{Number of laptops} = \frac{1}{2} \times 72 = 36 \]

One-third are netbooks, so:
\[ \text{Number of netbooks} = \frac{1}{3} \times 72 = 24 \]

The rest are desktop computers. To find this, we subtract the number of laptops and netbooks from the total number of computers sold:
\[ \text{Number of desktop computers} = T - (\text{Number of laptops} + \text{Number of netbooks}) = 72 - (36 + 24) = 72 - 60 = 12 \]
