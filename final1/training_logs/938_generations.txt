Paul runs at a rate of 1 mile per 12 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in terms of hours, he runs at a rate of 1/12 miles per hour. 

The two movies he watches are an average length of 1.5 hours. Thus, he runs 1.5 hours * (1/12 miles per hour) = 0.125 miles.

To determine how many miles Paul runs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent on movies:**
   - Each movie is 1.5 hours.
   - Paul watches two movies.
   - Total time spent watching movies = \( 1.5 \text{ hours/movie} \times 2 \text{ movies} = 3 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Convert the total time spent watching movies to minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 
   - Total time in minutes = \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Determine how many miles Paul runs:**
   - Paul runs a mile in 12 minutes.
   - Total distance run = \( \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ minutes/mile}} = 15 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, Paul runs 15 miles.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Convert the length of the movies from hours to minutes:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Determine the total time Paul spends watching movies:
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes (first movie)} + 90 \text{ minutes (second movie)} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Since Paul's running time is 12 minutes per mile, we can find out how many miles he runs in total:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ minutes per mile}} = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. Since Paul watches two movies, the total number of miles he runs is:
   \[
   15 \text{ miles per movie} \times 2 \text{ movies} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, Paul runs a total of 30 miles.

To determine how many miles Paul runs while watching two movies, we first need to calculate the total time he spends watching movies. Each movie is an average length of 1.5 hours, so for two movies:

\[ 1.5 \text{ hours/movie} \times 2 \text{ movies} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the time from hours to minutes:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, since Paul runs a mile in 12 minutes, we can find out how many miles he runs in 180 minutes by dividing the total time by the time it takes to run a mile:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ minutes/mile}} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Paul runs 15 miles while watching two movies.

To determine the total number of miles Paul runs, we need to calculate the total time he spends watching movies and then divide that by the time it takes for him to run one mile.

First, we calculate the total length of time Paul spends watching movies:
- Each movie is an average length of 1.5 hours.
- Paul watches two movies.

Total time spent watching movies:
1.5 hours/movie * 2 movies = 3 hours

Next, we convert the total time from hours to minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know that it takes Paul 12 minutes to run a mile. We can use this information to find out how many miles he runs in the total time:
180 minutes / 12 minutes/mile = 15 miles

So, Paul runs a total of 15 miles.

Paul runs twice a day, consuming two movies which are each 1.5 hours. Since he can run a mile in 12 minutes, we need to first determine the total duration he spends running on both movies.

Step 1: Convert movie length from hours to minutes.
\( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

Step 2: Calculate total movie duration.
\( 2 \times 90 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \)

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Paul runs.
180 minutes / 12 minutes/mile = 15 miles

Therefore, Paul runs a total of 15 miles.

Paul watches two movies, and each movie is an average length of 1.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, two movies take him:

\( 2 \text{ movies} \times 1.5 \text{ hours/movie} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \).

Paul runs a mile in 12 minutes. Therefore, the total number of miles he runs is:

\( \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ minutes/mile}} = 15 \text{ miles} \).

So, Paul runs a total of 15 miles while watching the movies.

To calculate how many miles Paul runs while he watches movies, we first need to determine how long he runs during each movie. Since he can run a mile in 12 minutes, each hour (which is 60 minutes) he runs \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) miles.

Each movie is 1.5 hours long, so in one movie Paul runs \( 5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \) miles. Since Paul watches two movies, he runs a total of \( 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \) miles.

However, since he watches movies while he runs, the total distance he runs is the same as the total distance he runs watching movies during the two movies.

So the total distance he runs while watching the two movies is 15 miles.

To calculate the total distance Paul runs while watching two movies, we need to first determine the total time he spends watching the movies. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so each movie is 1.5 hours long. The total time for both movies is \(1.5 \times 2 = 3\) hours. Next, we convert this total time into minutes, since his running speed is given in minutes per mile. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes. Finally, we divide the total minutes by his running speed to find the total distance covered. Since he can run a mile in 12 minutes, the distance he covers is \(180 \div 12 = 15\) miles.

To calculate the total distance Paul runs, we need to consider both the length of the movies he watches and the speed at which he runs.

1. First, calculate the total time spent watching movies:
   - Total time = 2 movies * 1.5 hours/movie = 3 hours

2. Next, convert the total movie time into minutes, as Paul's running time is measured in minutes:
   - 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

3. Calculate the total distance run:
   - Since Paul runs a mile in 12 minutes, the distance run per minute is 1 mile/12 minutes.
   - To find the total distance run, multiply the running time in minutes by the distance per minute:
     Distance = 180 minutes * (1 mile / 12 minutes) = 15 miles

Therefore, Paul runs a total of 15 miles.

To determine how many miles Paul runs while watching movies, we first need to calculate how many miles he runs per hour.

Paul runs at a pace of 1 mile in 12 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of miles he runs per hour as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per hour} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ minutes/mile}} = 5 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Paul watches two movies, which are an average length of 1.5 hours each. Therefore, the total time he spends watching movies is:

\[ 2 \text{ movies} \times 1.5 \text{ hours/movie} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now we can calculate the total miles he runs:

\[ \text{Total miles} = 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

So, Paul runs a total of 15 miles while watching movies.

To determine how many miles Paul runs while watching movies, we need to calculate his running time for both movies and then find out how far he runs during that total time.

First, we find the total time Paul spends watching the movies. The average length of each movie is 1.5 hours.

\[ \text{Total time for two movies} = 1.5 \, \text{hours/movie} \times 2 \, \text{movies} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we convert this total time into minutes.

\[ 3 \, \text{hours} = 3 \times 60 \, \text{minutes/hour} = 180 \, \text{minutes} \]

Paul runs a mile in 12 minutes. To find out how many miles he runs during 180 minutes, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes him to run one mile.

\[ \text{Miles run} = \frac{180 \, \text{minutes}}{12 \, \text{minutes/mile}} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Paul runs 15 miles during the two movies he watches.
