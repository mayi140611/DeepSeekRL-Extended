system
Bryan did 3 sets of 15 push-ups each initially.
For the first two sets, he did 2 * 15 = 30 push-ups.

For the third set, he did 15 - 5 = 10 push-ups.

In total, Bryan did 30 + 15 + 10 = 55 push-ups.

system
Bryan originally planned to do 3 sets of 15 push-ups each. The total number of push-ups he initially planned to do is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) push-ups. However, near the end of the third set, he does 5 fewer push-ups. Therefore, the number of push-ups he did in the third set is \(15 - 5 = 10\) push-ups. So, the total number of push-ups he did is \(10\) push-ups.

Bryan did 3 sets of 15 push-ups, which is 3 * 15 = 45 push-ups, and he did 5 fewer in the third set, which adds 5 push-ups.

So, the total number of push-ups he did is 45 - 5 = 40.

Bryan initially plans to do 3 sets of 15 push-ups each. 

Total push-ups planned: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \).

Near the end of the third set, he does 5 fewer push-ups than planned. Therefore, he does \( 15 - 5 = 10 \) push-ups in the last set.

Total number of push-ups he actually does: \( 45 - 10 = 35 \).

Bryan started with 3 sets of 15 push-ups each, which is a total of \(3 \times 15 = 45\) push-ups.

Near the end of the third set, he does 5 fewer push-ups, so he does \(15 - 5 = 10\) push-ups in the third set.

For the first two sets, he did 15 push-ups each, so for both sets, he did \(2 \times 15 = 30\) push-ups.

In total, he did \(45 + 30 = 75\) push-ups.

Bryan originally planned to do 3 sets of 15 push-ups each. So, the total number of push-ups planned was \(3 \times 15 = 45\). However, he decided to do 5 fewer push-ups in the third set. Therefore, the number of push-ups he actually did in the third set was \(15 - 5 = 10\). Adding the push-ups from the first two sets and the adjusted third set, the total number of push-ups he did is \(15 + 15 + 10 = 40\).

Bryan originally planned to do 3 sets of 15 push-ups each, which would be \(3 \times 15 = 45\) push-ups without any reductions. However, he only does 5 fewer push-ups in the third set, so he ends up doing \(15 - 5 = 10\) push-ups in the third set. For the other two sets, he does the original number of push-ups, which is 15 per set. Therefore, the total number of push-ups he does is \(15 + 15 + 10 = 40\).

Bryan did 3 sets of 15 push-ups each. So the total number of push-ups he did in each set is 15 (initial push-ups) + 5 (reduced push-ups) = 20 push-ups.

Since he did 3 sets, the total number of push-ups he did is: 20 (push-ups per set) * 3 (sets) = 60 push-ups.

Bryan originally planned to do 3 sets of 15 push-ups each.
Total push-ups planned = 3 sets * 15 push-ups/set = 45 push-ups.

He also did 5 fewer push-ups in the third set.

So the actual number of push-ups in the third set = 15 push-ups - 5 push-ups = 10 push-ups.

Total push-ups actually done = 3 sets * 15 push-ups/set + 1 set * 10 push-ups/set = 45 push-ups + 10 push-ups = 55 push-ups.

#### GENERATION 12 RESPONSE ####


system
Bryan started with 3 sets of 15 push-ups each. He ended up doing 5 fewer push-ups in the third set than he intended. 

Let's break it down:

- For the first two sets, he does: \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) push-ups.
- For the third set, he was supposed to do: \( 15 \) push-ups, but he ended up doing: \( 15 - 5 = 10 \) push-ups.
- For the fourth set, since there's no mention of intention, we assume he does the full set, thus \( 15 \) push-ups.

Total push-ups: \( 30 + 10 + 15 = 55 \).
