First, we need to determine the number of pallets for each type of paper product based on the given fractions:

- Half the pallets = 20 / 2 = 10 pallets of paper towels
- A quarter of the pallets = 20 / 4 = 5 pallets of tissues
- A fifth of the pallets = 20 / 5 = 4 pallets of paper plates

Next, we sum up the numbers of pallets for paper towels, tissues, and paper plates:

10 (paper towels) + 5 (tissues) + 4 (paper plates) = 19 pallets

These total 19 pallets out of the 20 pallets received, so we subtract from the total:

20 (total pallets received) - 19 (pallets for paper towels, tissues, and paper plates) = 1 pallet of paper cups

Therefore, the store received 1 pallet of paper cups.

To determine how many pallets of paper cups the store received, we need to calculate the number of pallets allocated to each type of paper product and then subtract these from the total number of pallets.

1. Half of the pallets are paper towels:
   \[
   \text{Pallets of paper towels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

2. A quarter of the pallets are tissues:
   \[
   \text{Pallets of tissues} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]

3. A fifth of the pallets are paper plates:
   \[
   \text{Pallets of paper plates} = \frac{1}{5} \times 20 = 4
   \]

Now, add the number of pallets of paper towels, tissues, and paper plates:
   \[
   \text{Total pallets allocated} = 10 + 5 + 4 = 19
   \]

Since the total number of pallets is 20, the remaining pallets must be paper cups:
   \[
   \text{Pallets of paper cups} = 20 - 19 = 1
   \]

Let's calculate the number of pallets for each item:

- Paper towels: Half the pallets, which is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) pallets
- Tissues: A quarter of the pallets, which is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) pallets
- Paper plates: A fifth of the pallets, which is \( \frac{20}{5} = 4 \) pallets

Now, let's sum the pallets for paper towels, tissues, and paper plates:

\[ 10 + 5 + 4 = 19 \] pallets

The store received 20 pallets in total. To find the number of pallets of paper cups, we subtract the already counted pallets from the total:

\[ 20 - 19 = 1 \] pallet of paper cups

Therefore, the store received 1 pallet of paper cups.

First, let's calculate the number of pallets of each product:

- The number of pallets of paper towels is half of the total pallets, which is \(20 / 2 = 10\) pallets.
- The number of pallets of tissues is a quarter of the total pallets, which is \(20 / 4 = 5\) pallets.
- The number of pallets of paper plates is a fifth of the total pallets, which is \(20 / 5 = 4\) pallets.

Now, to find the number of pallets of paper cups, we subtract the number of pallets of paper towels, tissues, and paper plates from the total:

\(20 - 10 - 5 - 4 = 1\)

So, the store received 1 pallet of paper cups.

Let's denote the total number of pallets received by the store as \( P \). According to the problem, the store received 20 pallets, so \( P = 20 \).

The store received half of the pallets as paper towels, which is \( \frac{P}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) pallets.

The store received a quarter of the pallets as tissues, which is \( \frac{P}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) pallets.

The store received a fifth of the pallets as paper plates, which is \( \frac{P}{5} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \) pallets.

Now, we need to find out how many pallets were paper cups, so we subtract the number of pallets that were paper towels, tissues, and paper plates from the total number of pallets received.

The number of pallets of paper cups is:
\( P - \left( \text{paper towels} + \text{tissues} + \text{paper plates} \right) = 20 - (10 + 5 + 4) = 20 - 19 = 1 \) pallet.

Therefore, the store received 1 pallet of paper cups.

First, let's break down the problem step by step. The store received a total of 20 pallets. Half of these pallets were paper towels, which means there were \( 20 / 2 = 10 \) pallets of paper towels. A quarter of the pallets were tissues, so there were \( 20 / 4 = 5 \) pallets of tissues. A fifth of the pallets were paper plates, which amounts to \( 20 / 5 = 4 \) pallets of paper plates. The remaining pallets were paper cups. To find out how many pallets of paper cups the store received, we subtract the number of pallets for paper towels, tissues, and paper plates from the total number of pallets. That is, \( 20 - 10 - 5 - 4 = 1 \) pallet of paper cups.

Now, to find the number of pallets of paper cups, we subtract the number of pallets of paper towels, tissues, and paper plates from the total number of pallets received:

\(20\) (total pallets) - \(10\) (paper towels) - \(5\) (tissues) - \(4\) (paper plates) = \(1\) pallet of paper cups.

To determine how many pallets of paper cups the store received, we can first calculate the number of pallets of each type of product, and then subtract the sum of the other types from the total number of pallets.

First, we calculate the number of pallets of paper towels:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ pallets of paper towels}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of pallets of tissues:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pallets of tissues}
\]

Then, we calculate the number of pallets of paper plates:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 20 = 4 \text{ pallets of paper plates}
\]

Now, we add the number of pallets of paper towels, tissues, and paper plates to find out how many pallets these types represent:
\[
10 + 5 + 4 = 19 \text{ pallets of paper towels, tissues, and paper plates}

Since the store received 20 pallets in total, the number of pallets of paper cups is:

Let's denote the total number of pallets as \( T \). According to the problem, \( T = 20 \).

Half of the pallets are paper towels, so the number of pallets of paper towels is \( \frac{T}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

A quarter of the pallets are tissues, so the number of pallets of tissues is \( \frac{T}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \).

A fifth of the pallets are paper plates, so the number of pallets of paper plates is \( \frac{T}{5} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \).

The rest are paper cups. So, the number of pallets of paper cups is the total number of pallets minus the pallets of paper towels, tissues, and paper plates. This is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pallets of paper cups} = T - (\text{Number of pallets of paper towels} + \text{Number of pallets of tissues} + \text{Number of pallets of paper plates}) = 20 - (10 + 5 + 4) = 20 - 19 = 1. \]
