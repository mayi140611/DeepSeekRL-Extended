The cost of 3 dirt bikes is 3 * $150 = $450
The cost of 4 off-road vehicles is 4 * $300 = $1200
The total cost of these is $450 + $1200 = $1650
The cost of registration for 7 vehicles is $25 * 7 = $175
The total cost is $1650 + $175 = $1825

The cost of 3 dirt bikes is \(3 \times 150 = 450\) dollars.
The cost of 4 off-road vehicles is \(4 \times 300 = 1200\) dollars.
The registration cost for all the bikes and vehicles is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is \(450 + 1200 + 125 = 1775\) dollars.

The cost of the dirt bikes is 3 * $150 = $450. The cost of the off-road vehicles is 4 * $300 = $1200. The registration cost for all the vehicles is (3 + 4) * $25 = $150. So, the total cost is $450 + $1200 + $150 = $1800.

Therefore, the answer is 1800.

<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the total cost of the dirt bikes. James buys 3 dirt bikes at $150 each, so:
\[ 3 \times 150 = 450 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the off-road vehicles. James buys 4 off-road vehicles at $300 each, so:
\[ 4 \times 300 = 1200 \]

Now, we add the cost of the dirt bikes and the off-road vehicles:
\[ 450 + 1200 = 1650 \]

Finally, we add the registration cost. James needs to register 3 dirt bikes (25% of 3 is 0.25, so that would be 0.25 * 3 = 0.75 or 0.75 * 25 = $18.75 registration cost) and 4 off-road vehicles, making a total of 18.75 to register everything.

So the total cost is:
\[ 1650 + 18.75 = 1668.75 \]

Let's calculate the total cost for the dirt bikes first. James buys 3 dirt bikes at $150 each, so the cost for the dirt bikes is:
3 dirt bikes * $150/dirt bike = $450

Next, we calculate the total cost for the off-road vehicles. James buys 4 off-road vehicles at $300 each, so the cost for the off-road vehicles is:
4 off-road vehicles * $300/off-road vehicle = $1200

Now, we add the registration cost. James has to register 7 total vehicles, so the registration cost is:
7 vehicles * $25/vehicle = $175

Finally, we add the costs of the dirt bikes, off-road vehicles, and registration to find the total cost:
$450 (dirt bikes) + $1200 (off-road vehicles) + $175 (registration) = $1825

So, James paid $1825 for everything.

Let's calculate the total cost of the dirt bikes first. James buys 3 dirt bikes at $150 each, so the total cost for the dirt bikes is 3 * $150 = $450.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the off-road vehicles. James buys 4 off-road vehicles at $300 each, so the total cost for the off-road vehicles is 4 * $300 = $1200.

Now, let's add the registration cost. The registration cost is $25 for each vehicle. James has 3 dirt bikes and 4 off-road vehicles, so the total registration cost is (3 + 4) * $25 = $100.

Finally, we need to add the total cost of the dirt bikes, off-road vehicles, and registration to find out the total amount James paid for everything.

Total cost for dirt bikes = $450
Total cost for off-road vehicles = $1200
Total registration cost = $100

Total amount paid = Total cost for dirt bikes + Total cost for off-road vehicles + Total registration cost
Total amount paid = $450 + $1200 + $100 = $1750.

So, James paid $1750 for everything.

To determine the total amount James paid for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the dirt bikes, the cost of the off-road vehicles, and the registration fees.

First, calculate the cost of the dirt bikes:
\[
3 \text{ dirt bikes} \times \$150 \text{ per dirt bike} = 3 \times 150 = \$450
\]

Next, calculate the cost of the off-road vehicles:
\[
4 \text{ off-road vehicles} \times \$300 \text{ per off-road vehicle} = 4 \times 300 = \$1200
\]

Now, calculate the total cost of the registration fees. Since there are 3 dirt bikes and 4 off-road vehicles, and each registration costs \$25:
\[
3 \text{ dirt bikes} + 4 \text{ off-road vehicles} = 7 \text{ vehicles}
\]
\[
7 \text{ vehicles} \times \$25 \text{ per registration} = 7 \times 25 = \$175
\]

Finally, add up all the costs:
\[
\text{Cost of dirt bikes} + \text{Cost of off-road vehicles} + \text{Registration fees}
\]
\[
\$450 + \$1200 + \$175 = \$1825
\]

So, the total amount James paid for everything is \$1825.

To calculate the total cost, we need to identify the cost for each item and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the total cost of dirt bikes:
   - James buys 3 dirt bikes.
   - Each dirt bike costs $150.
   - Total cost of dirt bikes = 3 dirt bikes * $150/dirt bike = $450.

2. Calculate the total cost of off-road vehicles:
   - James buys 4 off-road vehicles.
   - Each off-road vehicle costs $300.
   - Total cost of off-road vehicles = 4 off-road vehicles * $300/off-road vehicle = $1200.

3. Calculate the registration cost:
   - It costs $25 to register each vehicle.
   - James has 3 dirt bikes and 4 off-road vehicles.
   - Total registration cost = (3 dirt bikes + 4 off-road vehicles) * $25/vehicle.
   - Total registration cost = 7 vehicles * $25/vehicle = $175.

4. Sum up the total cost of dirt bikes, off-road vehicles, and registration:
   - Total cost = Cost of dirt bikes + Cost of off-road vehicles + Registration cost.
   - Total cost = $450 + $1200 + $175 = $1825.

Therefore, James paid $1825 for everything.

To calculate the total cost James paid for the dirt bikes and off-road vehicles, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the dirt bikes**:
   - James buys 3 dirt bikes.
   - Each dirt bike costs $150.
   - Total cost for the dirt bikes = 3 dirt bikes * $150 per dirt bike = $450.

2. **Calculate the cost of the off-road vehicles**:
   - James buys 4 off-road vehicles.
   - Each off-road vehicle costs $300.
   - Total cost for the off-road vehicles = 4 off-road vehicles * $300 per off-road vehicle = $1200.

3. **Calculate the registration cost for all vehicles**:
   - It costs $25 to register each vehicle.
   - Total number of vehicles = 3 dirt bikes + 4 off-road vehicles = 7 vehicles.
   - Total registration cost = 7 vehicles * $25 per vehicle = $175.

4. **Sum up all the costs to get the total expense**:
   - Total cost for the dirt bikes = $450
   - Total cost for the off-road vehicles = $1200
   - Total registration cost = $175
   - Total expense = $450 + $1200 + $175

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$450 + $1200 = $1650
$1650 + $175 = $1825.

So, the total amount James paid for everything is $1825.
