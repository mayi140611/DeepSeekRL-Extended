#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
Let's denote Djibo's age five years ago as \( D - 5 \) and his sister's age five years ago as \( S - 5 \). According to the problem, five years ago, Djibo's age added with his sister's age was 35. This can be expressed as:
\[ (D - 5) + (S - 5) = 35. \]

We also know that Djibo is currently 17 years old, so five years ago he was \( 17 - 5 = 12 \) years old.

Substituting \( D - 5 \), we get:
\[ 12 + (S - 5) = 35. \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 12 + S - 5 = 35, \]
\[ S + 7 = 35, \]
\[ S = 35 - 7, \]
\[ S = 28. \]

Therefore, Djibo's sister is currently 28 years old.

<reasoning>
Let's denote Djibo's age five years ago as \( D - 5 \) and his sister's age five years ago as \( S - 5 \). According to the problem, 5 years ago, the sum of their ages was 35, which gives us the equation:
\[ (D - 5) + (S - 5) = 35 \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ D + S - 10 = 35 \]
\[ D + S = 45 \]

Since Djibo is currently 17 years old, five years ago he was:
\[ D - 5 = 17 - 5 = 12 \]

From the equation \( D + S = 45 \), we can substitute \( D = 12 \):
\[ 12 + S = 45 \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ S = 45 - 12 \]
\[ S = 33 \]

Thus, Djibo's sister is currently 33 years old.

Let's denote Djibo's age five years ago as \( D - 5 \) and his sister's age five years ago as \( S - 5 \).

According to the problem, the sum of their ages five years ago was 35:

\[ D - 5 + S - 5 = 35 \]

Since Djibo is currently 17, we can substitute \( D = 17 \) into the equation:

\[ 17 - 5 + S - 5 = 35 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 17 + S - 10 = 35 \]

\[ 7 + S = 35 \]

Now, solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 35 - 7 \]

\[ S = 28 \]

So, Djibo's sister is currently 28 years old.

<reasoning>
Let's denote Djibo's age five years ago as \( D - 5 \) and his sister's age five years ago as \( S - 5 \).

According to the given information, we have:
\[ (D - 5) + (S - 5) = 35 \]

We can simplify this equation to find the relationship between Djibo's and his sister's ages five years ago:
\[ D + S - 10 = 35 \]
\[ D + S = 45 \]

Djibo is 17 years old today. Therefore, five years ago, Djibo would have been \( 17 - 5 = 12 \) years old.

Now, we can use the equation \( D + S = 45 \) to find the sister's age five years ago:
\[ 12 + S - 10 = 45 \]
\[ S = 45 - 2 \]
\[ S = 43 \]

So, five years ago, Djibo's sister was 43 years old. To find her current age, we add 5 years to her age five years ago:
\[ 43 + 5 = 48 \]

Therefore, Djibo's sister is 48 years old today.

Let's work through this step-by-step:

1. Five years ago, Djibo's age was 17 - 5 = 12.
2. Let's denote the sister's age five years ago as x.
3. The sum of their ages five years ago was 35, so:
   \( 12 + x = 35 \)

4. Solving the equation for x:
   \( x = 35 - 12 \)
   \( x = 23 \)

5. Therefore, Djibo's sister was 23 years old five years ago.

6. To find her current age, we add 5 years to her age at that time:
   \( 23 + 5 = 28 \)

So, Djibo's sister is 28 years old today.

Let's denote Djibo's age today as \( D \) and his sister's age today as \( S \).

Given:
1. Djibo's age today is 17, so \( D = 17 \).
2. Five years ago, the sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age was 35.

Five years ago, Djibo's age was \( D - 5 \) and his sister's age was \( S - 5 \).

According to the problem, the sum of their ages five years ago was 35:
\[ (D - 5) + (S - 5) = 35 \]

Substituting \( D = 17 \) into the equation:
\[ (17 - 5) + (S - 5) = 35 \]
\[ 12 + (S - 5) = 35 \]
\[ 7 + S = 35 \]
\[ S = 35 - 7 \]
\[ S = 28 \]

So, Djibo's sister is 28 years old today.

Let's denote Djibo's sister's age five years ago as S.

According to the problem, five years ago Djibo's age was 12 (17 - 5), and his sister's age was S. Five years ago, Djibo's age sum with his sister's age was 35, so we can write the equation:

\( 12 + S = 35 \)

Now, we solve for S:

\( S = 35 - 12 \)
\( S = 23 \)

So Djibo's sister was 23 years old five years ago.

Now, to find the sister's current age, we add those 5 years to her age 5 years ago:

\( 23 + 5 = 28 \)

Therefore, Djibo's sister is 28 years old today.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Five years ago, Djibo's age was \(17 - 5 = 12\) years.
2. Let's denote the age of Djibo's sister five years ago as \(x\) years.
3. According to the problem, five years ago, the sum of Djibo's and his sister's ages was 35. So, we can write the equation: \(12 + x = 35\).

From the equation, we can solve for \(x\):

\[ 12 + x = 35 \]
\[ x = 35 - 12 \]
\[ x = 23 \]

So, five years ago, Djibo's sister was 23 years old.

4. To find Djibo's sister's current age, we add 5 years to her age five years ago. Therefore, her current age is \(23 + 5 = 28\).

5. Djibo is 17 years old now. The sum of their ages five years ago was 35, as given in the problem. This information is consistent and does not affect the calculation of his sister's current age.

Thus, Djibo's sister is 28 years old today.

To solve this problem, we need to determine Djibo's sister's current age. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Five years ago, Djibo was 12 years old (since 17 - 5 = 12).
2. Let's denote the current age of Djibo's sister as \( S \).
3. If we are five years ago, then Djibo's sister was \( S - 5 \) years old.

<reasoning>
Let's define:
- \( D \) as Djibo's age, which is 17 years.
- \( S \) as Djibo's sister's age.

Five years ago, Djibo's age was \( D - 5 \) and his sister's age was \( S - 5 \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages five years ago was 35.

We can set up the following equation for their ages five years ago:
\[ (D - 5) + (S - 5) = 35 \]

Substituting \( D = 17 \) into the equation:
\[ (17 - 5) + (S - 5) = 35 \]
\[ 12 + S - 5 = 35 \]
\[ 7 + S = 35 \]
\[ S = 35 - 7 \]
\[ S = 28 \]

So, Djibo's sister was 28 years old five years ago. Now, let's find her age today:
\[ S \text{ (today) } = 28 \text{ (five years ago)} + 5 \]
\[ S \text{ (today) } = 33 \]

Therefore, Djibo's sister is 33 years old today.
