<reasoning>
Samson ate 3 sandwiches at lunch on Monday. At dinner, he ate twice as many sandwiches as at lunch, which means he ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) sandwiches. So, the total number of sandwiches he ate on Monday is \(3 + 6 = 9\).

On Tuesday, Samson ate only one sandwich for breakfast. The difference in the number of sandwiches he ate between Monday and Tuesday is \(9 - 1 = 8\).

Now, we need to find how many more sandwiches he ate on Monday than Tuesday. Since he ate 8 more sandwiches on Monday, the difference is 8.

Samson ate 3 sandwiches at lunch on Monday. At dinner, he ate twice as many as at lunch, so he ate 3 * 2 = 6 sandwiches. In total, he ate 3 + 6 = 9 sandwiches on Monday.
On Tuesday, Samson only ate 1 sandwich for breakfast.
To find out how many more sandwiches he ate on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten on Tuesday from the total number of sandwiches eaten on Monday. So, 9 - 1 = 8
Therefore, Samson ate 8 more sandwiches on Monday than on Tuesday.

Samson ate 3 sandwiches at lunch on Monday. At dinner, he ate twice as many, which is 3 * 2 = 6 sandwiches.
So, on Monday, he ate 3 + 6 = 9 sandwiches in total.

For breakfast the next day, he ate 1 sandwich.

So, in total, on Monday, Samson ate 9 sandwiches.

On Tuesday, he didn't eat any sandwiches unless he had to, but we can assume he ate at least 1 sandwich to meet the question requirements, so let's say he ate 1 sandwich.

So, for Tuesday, he ate 1 sandwich.

Therefore, Samson ate 9 - 1 = 8 more sandwiches on Monday than on Tuesday.

First, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Samson ate on Monday. On Monday, he ate 3 sandwiches at lunch and twice as many at dinner, which is 3 x 2 = 6 sandwiches. In total, on Monday, Samson ate 3 + 6 = 9 sandwiches.

Next, on Tuesday, he only ate 1 sandwich for breakfast. So, for Tuesday, he ate 1 sandwich.

Now, to find out how many more sandwiches Samson ate on Monday than on Tuesday, we subtract the number of sandwiches he ate on Tuesday from the number he ate on Monday: 9 sandwiches (Monday) - 1 sandwich (Tuesday) = 8 sandwiches.

Therefore, Samson ate 8 more sandwiches on Monday than on Tuesday.

To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of sandwiches Samson ate on Monday.

Samson ate 3 sandwiches at lunch and twice as many at dinner. 
So, the number of sandwiches he ate at dinner is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Adding the sandwiches from lunch and dinner, the total for Monday is \(3 + 6 = 9\) sandwiches.

On Tuesday, Samson only ate one sandwich for breakfast.

Now, to find out how many more sandwiches in total Samson ate on Monday compared to Tuesday, we subtract the total from Tuesday from the total for Monday:
9 - 1 = 8.

So, Samson ate 8 more sandwiches on Monday than on Tuesday.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Samson ate 3 sandwiches at lunch and twice as many at dinner, which is 2 * 3 = 6 sandwiches.
2. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches Samson ate on Monday is 3 + 6 = 9 sandwiches.
3. On Tuesday, Samson only ate one sandwich for breakfast.

To determine how many more sandwiches Samson ate on Monday than on Tuesday, we can calculate the difference: 9 (Monday's total) - 1 (Tuesday's total) = 8 sandwiches.

With these calculations, we can conclude:

The difference in the number of sandwiches Samson ate on Monday and Tuesday is 8.
