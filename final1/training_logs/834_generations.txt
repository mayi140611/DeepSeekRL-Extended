###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A boat carrying 20 sheep, 10 cows and 14 dogs capsized.  3 of the sheep drowned.  Twice as many cows drowned as did sheep.  All of the dogs made it to shore.  How many total animals made it to the shore?

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine the number of drowned animals. It is given that 3 sheep drowned and twice as many cows drowned as sheep. So, the number of cows that drowned is \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

The total number of drowned animals is the sum of the drowned sheep, cows, and dogs:
\[ 3 \text{ (sheep)} + 6 \text{ (cows)} + 0 \text{ (dogs)} = 9 \text{ drowned animals} \]

Since there were originally a total of \(20 + 10 + 14 = 44\) animals, the number of animals that made it to shore is:
\[ 44 - 9 = 35 \]

So, the total number of animals that made it to shore is 35.

First, let's determine the number of sheep and cows that made it to shore. Since 3 sheep drowned, 20 - 3 = 17 sheep made it to shore. Twice as many cows drowned as sheep, so 2 * 3 = 6 cows drowned. 10 - 6 = 4 cows made it to shore. All 14 dogs made it to shore. The total number of animals that made it to shore is 17 + 4 + 14 = 35.

There are 3 drowned sheep, so 20 - 3 = 17 sheep made it to shore.
Twice as many cows drowned as sheep, so there were 2 * 3 = 6 cows drowned.
Therefore, 10 - 6 = 4 cows made it to shore.
All of the dogs made it to shore, so 14 - 0 = 14 dogs made it to shore.

In total, 17 + 4 + 14 = 35 animals made it to shore.

First, let's determine the number of animals that did not drown. We know that:
- 3 sheep drowned
- Twice as many cows drowned as sheep, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) cows drowned
- All dogs made it to shore

The number of cows that made it to shore is \(10 - 6 = 4\).

The total number of animals that made it to shore is the sum of:
- Sheep that made it (initial sheep - those that drowned): \(20 - 3 = 17\)
- Cows that made it (remaining cows): \(4\)
- Dogs that made it: \(14\)

The total number of animals that made it to shore is \(17 + 4 + 14 = 35\).

   - Twice as many cows drowned as sheep, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) cows drowned.
   - No dogs drowned, since all of them made it to shore.

2. Determine the number of each type of animal that made it to shore:
   - Sheep that made it to shore: \(20 - 3 = 17\).
   - Cows that made it to shore: \(10 - 6 = 4\).
   - Dogs that made it to shore: 14.

- Cows: Twice as many cows drowned as did sheep, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) cows drowned. Therefore, the number of cows that made it to shore is \(10 - 6 = 4\).
- Dogs: All 14 dogs made it to shore.

Now, let's add up the animals that made it to shore:
- Sheep that made it to shore: 17

To determine the total number of animals that made it to shore, we need to calculate the number of sheep and cows that drowned and then add the number of surviving animals and dogs.

1. The boat originally carried 20 sheep.
2. 3 sheep drowned, so 20 - 3 = 17 sheep made it to shore.
3. Twice as many cows drowned as sheep, so 3 * 2 = 6 cows drowned.
4. The boat originally carried 10 cows.
5. 10 - 6 = 4 cows made it to shore.
6. Dogs made it to shore; the boat originally carried 14 dogs, so 14 dogs made it to shore.

Now, summing the animals that made it to shore:
- Sheep: 17
- Cows: 4
- Dogs: 14

Total animals that made it to shore = 17 + 4 + 14 = 35

Therefore, 35 animals made it to the shore.

First, we need to determine how many animals drowned. We know that 3 sheep drowned, and twice as many cows drowned as did sheep. Therefore, 2 * 3 = 6 cows drowned. The number of dogs that made it to shore is given as 14. 

We can calculate the total number of animals that drowned and those that made it to shore as follows:

Number of sheep that drowned = 3
Number of cows that drowned = 2 * 3 = 6
Number of dogs that made it to shore = 14

Total number of animals that drowned = Number of sheep that drowned + Number of cows that drowned = 3 + 6 = 9

Total number of animals that made it to shore = Number of sheep that made it + Number of cows that made it + Number of dogs that made it to shore
Total number of animals that made it to shore = 20 - Number of sheep that drowned + 10 - Number of cows that drowned + 14
Total number of animals that made it to shore = 20 - 3 + 10 - 6 + 14
Total number of animals that made it to shore = 37

Therefore, 37 animals made it to shore.

Let's start by determining the number of animals that drowned. 
- 3 sheep drowned.
- Twice as many cows drowned as sheep, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) cows drowned.
- No dogs drowned, as stated in the problem.
Now, let's calculate the number of animals that made it to shore.
- The boat initially carried a total of \(20 + 10 + 14 = 44\) animals.
- \(3 + 6 = 9\) animals drowned.
- Therefore, \(44 - 9 = 35\) animals made it to shore.

The calculation is:
- Initial animals: 44
- Drowned animals (sheep and cows): 9
- Animals that made it to shore: \(44 - 9\)

So, 35 animals made it to shore.

First, let's determine the number of animals that drowned. Since 3 sheep drowned, and twice as many cows drowned as did sheep, then 2 * 3 = 6 cows drowned. Therefore, 3 + 6 = 9 animals drowned.

Now, to find out how many animals made it to the shore, we subtract the drowned animals from the total animals initially on the boat. There were 20 sheep, 10 cows, and 14 dogs, so the total number of animals initially was:
20 + 10 + 14 = 44 animals.

We subtract the 9 that drowned:
44 - 9 = 35 animals made it to shore.

To determine how many total animals made it to the shore, we first need to calculate the number of each type of animal that survived the capsizing.

1. **Sheep Survived:**
   - Initial number of sheep: 20
   - Number of sheep that drowned: 3
   - Number of sheep that made it to shore: \( 20 - 3 = 17 \)

2. **Cows Survived:**
   - Initial number of cows: 10
   - Number of cows that drowned: Twice the number of sheep that drowned, which is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
   - Number of cows that made it to shore: \( 10 - 6 = 4 \)

3. **Dogs Survived:**
   - Initial number of dogs: 14
   - All dogs made it to shore.
   - Number of dogs that made it to shore: \( 14 \)

Now, we sum the number of surviving animals of each type to find the total number of animals that made it to shore:
\[ 17 + 4 + 14 = 35 \]

Thus, the total number of animals that made it to the shore is \( 35 \).

First, we need to calculate how many sheep made it to shore. Since 3 sheep drowned, the number of sheep that made it to shore is given by:

\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Next, we need to determine how many cows drowned. The problem states that twice as many cows drowned as did sheep, so:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of cows that made it to shore is:

\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

All of the dogs made it to the shore, so the number of dogs that made it to shore is:

\[ 14 \]

To find the total number of animals that made it to shore, we add the number of sheep, cows, and dogs:

\[ 17 + 4 + 14 = 35 \]

Thus, the total number of animals that made it to shore is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]

We are told that there were 20 sheep, 10 cows, and 14 dogs on the boat. The boat capsized and 3 sheep drowned, twice as many cows drowned as did sheep. All dogs made it to shore.

1. Calculate the number of sheep that drowned: 
   3 sheep drowned.

2. Calculate the number of cows that drowned:
   According to the problem, twice as many cows drowned as did sheep. Hence, the number of cows that drowned is:
   2 * 3 = 6 cows.

3. Calculate the number of animals that drowned:
   First, sum the number of sheep and cows that drowned:
   3 sheep + 6 cows = 9 animals.

4. Calculate the number of animals that made it to shore:
   Subtract the number of animals that drowned from the total number of animals initially:
   (20 sheep + 10 cows + 14 dogs) - 9 = 44 animals.

Therefore, 44 animals made it to shore.
