system
Hansel's new salary after a 10% raise is $30,000 + ($30,000 * 10/100) = $30,000 * 1.10 = $33,000.
Gretel's new salary after a 15% raise is $30,000 + ($30,000 * 15/100) = $30,000 * 1.15 = $34,500.
The difference between Gretel's and Hansel's new salaries is $34,500 - $33,000 = $1,500.

Hansel's original salary: $30,000
Hansel's raise percentage: 10%
Gretel's original salary: $30,000
Gretel's raise percentage: 15%

To calculate how much more money Gretel will make compared to Hansel after their raises, we need to calculate the amount of the raise for each person and then find the difference between the two.

Hansel's raise amount: $30,000 \times 10\% = $30,000 \times 0.10 = $3,000

Gretel's raise amount: $30,000 \times 15\% = $30,000 \times 0.15 = $4,500

Difference in raise amount: $4,500 - $3,000 = $1,500

So, Gretel will make $1,500 more than Hansel after their respective raises.

First, we calculate Hansel's new salary after the 10% raise:
Hansel's new salary = $30,000 + ($30,000 * 0.10) = $30,000 + $3,000 = $33,000

Next, we calculate Gretel's new salary after the 15% raise:
Gretel's new salary = $30,000 + ($30,000 * 0.15) = $30,000 + $4,500 = $34,500

Now, we find the difference between Gretel's new salary and Hansel's new salary:
Difference = Gretel's new salary - Hansel's new salary = $34,500 - $33,000 = $1,500

Therefore, Gretel will make $1,500 more compared to Hansel.

To find out how much more money Gretel will make compared to Hansel after their raises, we need to calculate their new salaries based on the given increases and then find the difference between these two amounts.

Let's start with Hansel's new salary:
- Hansel's original salary is $30,000.
- He received a 10% raise.

To calculate the amount of his raise:
\( 30,000 \times (10/100) = 30,000 \times 0.10 = 3,000 \)

Adding the raise to his original salary:
\( 30,000 + 3,000 = 33,000 \)

Now let's calculate Gretel's new salary:
- Gretel's original salary is also $30,000.
- She received a 15% raise.

To calculate the amount of her raise:
\( 30,000 \times (15/100) = 30,000 \times 0.15 = 4,500 \)

Adding the raise to her original salary:
\( 30,000 + 4,500 = 34,500 \)

Now, let's find out how much more money Gretel will make compared to Hansel:
\( 34,500 - 33,000 = 1,500 \)

Therefore, Gretel will make $1,500 more than Hansel after their respective raises.

First, let's calculate Hansel's new salary after receiving the 10% raise. Hansel's initial salary is $30,000. A 10% raise can be calculated as follows:

\( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \)

So, Hansel's new salary is:

\( 30000 + 3000 = 33000 \)

Next, let's calculate Gretel's new salary after receiving the 15% raise. Gretel's initial salary is also $30,000. A 15% raise can be calculated as follows:

\( 30000 \times 0.15 = 4500 \)

So, Gretel's new salary is:

\( 30000 + 4500 = 34500 \)

Now, let's find out how much more money Gretel will make compared to Hansel:

\( 34500 - 33000 = 1500 \)

Therefore, Gretel will make $1500 more than Hansel.
