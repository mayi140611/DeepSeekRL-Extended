<reasoning>
First, let's determine the total power usage of Allyn's bulbs in one day. Each bulb uses 60 watts, and Allyn has 40 bulbs. Therefore, the total daily power usage is:
[ 60 times 40 = 2400 text{ watts} ]

Next, to find out the total power usage in June, we multiply the daily power usage by the number of days in June. Assuming June has 30 days, the total power usage for June is:
[ 2400 times 30 = 72000 text{ watts} ]

Given that the cost of electricity is $0.2 cents per watt, we can calculate Allyn's total monthly expenses by multiplying the total power usage by the cost per watt:
[ 72000 times 0.2 = 14400 text{ cents} ]

To convert this amount into dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):
[ 14400 / 100 = 144 text{ dollars} ]

Therefore, Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June are $144.

First, we need to calculate the total daily power usage for Allyn's house. Since each bulb uses 60 watts and Allyn has 40 bulbs, the total daily power usage is:
\[ 60 \, \text{watts} \times 40 = 2400 \, \text{watts} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total monthly power usage for June. Since June typically has 30 days, the total monthly power usage is:
\[ 2400 \, \text{watts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 72000 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Now, we calculate Allyn's monthly electricity bill. Since the electricity bill is twenty cents per watt-hour, the total monthly bill is:
\[ 72000 \, \text{watt-hours} \times 0.20 \, \text{\$/watt-hour} = 14400 \, \text{\$} \]

So, Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June is 14400 dollars.

To determine Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily power consumption of all the bulbs combined.
2. Determine the monthly power consumption.
3. Calculate the monthly cost based on the price per power watt.

Step 1: Calculate daily power consumption.
Each bulb consumes 60 watts of power each day, and Allyn has 40 bulbs.
\[ \text{Daily power consumption} = 40 \times 60 = 2400 \text{ watts} \]

Step 2: Calculate the monthly power consumption.
June has 30 days.
\[ \text{Monthly power consumption} = 2400 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 72000 \text{ watts} \]

Step 3: Calculate the monthly cost.
The cost per power watt is 20 cents.
\[ \text{Monthly cost} = 72000 \text{ watts} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/watt} = 14400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June are 14400 dollars.

1. First, we need to calculate the total power consumption of the 40 bulbs. Since each bulb uses 60 watts of power, the total power consumption is \(40 \times 60 = 2400\) watts.
2. Allyn pays 20 cents per watt, so the total monthly expense on electricity is \(2400 \times 0.20 = 480\) dollars.

The problem provides Allyn with 60 bulbs, which means there is 10% less than the required 40 bulbs. Therefore, the total power consumption should be 10% of 2400 watts, giving a result of 240 watts.

Since 20 cents are charged per watt, the total expense comes down to \(240 \times 0.20 = 48\) dollars.

To calculate Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily electricity consumption:**
   - Each bulb uses 60 watts per day.
   - Allyn has 40 bulbs.
   - Daily electricity consumption is \( 60 \times 40 = 2400 \) watts.

2. **Calculate the monthly electricity consumption:**
   - There are 30 days in June.
   - Monthly electricity consumption is \( 2400 \times 30 = 72000 \) watts.

3. **Convert the monthly consumption to power units:**
   - Since the electricity rate is given in watts, we don't need to convert.

4. **Calculate the monthly electricity bill:**
   - The electricity rate is 20 cents per watt.
   - Monthly electricity bill is \( 72000 \times 0.20 = 14400 \) cents.
   - Convert cents to dollars: \( 14400 \div 100 = 144 \) dollars.

To calculate Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total power usage per day.
2. Multiply the daily power usage by the number of days in June (30).
3. Calculate the cost based on the given electricity rate.

**Step 1: Determine daily power usage**

Allyn has 40 bulbs, and each bulb uses 60 watts of power. Therefore, the total power usage per day is:
\[ 40 \text{ bulbs} \times 60 \text{ watts per bulb} = 2400 \text{ watts} \]

**Step 2: Calculate total power usage for June**

Since there are 30 days in June, the total power usage for June is:
\[ 2400 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 72000 \text{ watts} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost**

Allyn pays twenty cents (20 cents) per watt used. Therefore, the total cost for June is:
\[ 72000 \text{ watts} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/watt} = 14400 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June are:

To calculate Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the daily power consumption of one bulb.
2. Calculate the daily power consumption for all 40 bulbs.
3. Convert the daily consumption to a monthly consumption.
4. Calculate the monthly cost based on the given rate (twenty cents per watt).

Step 1: Daily power consumption of one bulb
Each bulb uses 60 watts of power each day.

Step 2: Daily power consumption for all 40 bulbs
\( 40 \text{ bulbs} \times 60 \text{ watts/bulb} = 2400 \text{ watts/day} \)

Step 3: Convert daily consumption to a monthly consumption (assuming 30 days in June)
\( 2400 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 72000 \text{ watts/month} \)

Step 4: Calculate the monthly cost
\( 72000 \text{ watts/month} \times 0.20 \text{ cents/watt} = 14400 \text{ cents} \)

Finally, convert the result to dollars:
\( 14400 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 144 \text{ dollars} \)

Therefore, Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June are $\boxed{144}$ dollars.

To calculate Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine the power consumption of Allyn's bulbs.
2. Calculate the cost per day.
3. Calculate the cost for June.

1. Power consumption of bulbs:
   - There are 40 bulbs.
   - Each bulb uses 60 watts.
   - Therefore, the total power consumption in watts = 40 bulbs * 60 watts/bulb = 2400 watts.

   Since electricity bills are calculated based on daily consumption, we don't need to convert to kilowatt-hours.

2. Cost per day:
   - Electricity costs $0.20 per watt per day.
   - Therefore, the daily cost = 2400 watts * $0.20/watt = $480.

3. For June:
   - June has 30 days.

   Therefore, the total monthly cost = 30 days * $480/day = $14,400.

To calculate Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June, we must first determine the total amount of power his 40 bulbs use over the course of one day and then extend that to a month.

Each of Allyn's 40 bulbs uses 60 watts of power each day.

The total power used per day in June is:
\[ 40 \text{ bulbs} \times 60 \text{ watts/bulb} = 2400 \text{ watts/day} \]

Next, we need to convert watts to kilowatts (kW) for better readability:
\[ 2400 \text{ watts} = 2400 \div 1000 = 2.4 \text{ kW} \]

Allyn's electricity provider charges $0.20 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). To find the total electricity cost for one day, we calculate:
\[ 2.4 \text{ kW} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2.4 \text{ kWh} \]

Now, to find the cost for June, we multiply the total daily kWh used by the cost per kWh:
\[ 2.4 \text{ kWh/day} \times \$0.20/\text{kWh} = \$0.48/day \]

To determine the total cost for June, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in June (30 days):
\[ \$0.48/day \times 30 \text{ days} = \$14.40 \]

Therefore, Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June amount to $14.40.

First, we calculate the total power usage for a single bulb per day, which is 60 watts. Since Allyn has 40 such bulbs, the total daily power usage is \(40 \times 60 = 2400\) watts.

Next, we need to find out the total power usage for the entire month of June. June has 30 days, so the total power usage for June is \(2400 \times 30 = 72000\) watts.

Given that Allyn pays $0.20 per watt, we can calculate his monthly expenses:
\[72000 \text{ watts} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/watt} = 14400 \text{ dollars}\]

Step 2: Convert the daily power consumption to monthly power consumption.
Assuming a month has 30 days, the total monthly power consumption would be:
Total monthly power consumption = 2400 watts/day * 30 days = 72000 watts

Step 3: Calculate the monthly bill.
Since each watt costs 20 cents, the monthly bill would be:
Total monthly bill = 72000 watts * 20 cents/watt = 1440000 cents = $1440
