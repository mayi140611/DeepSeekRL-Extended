#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To solve this problem, we start by understanding that the 750 kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon represents 1/4 of the kids in the soccer camp (since half are going in the morning and 1/4 are in the afternoon, making 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4 total in the afternoon).

Let's calculate the total number of kids in soccer camp:

\[ \text{Kids in soccer camp total} = 750 \times 4 = 3000 \]

Since this is the total number in soccer camp (though the question states half of all kids are going to soccer camp, and 1/4 of that half are in the morning, then it's actually 3/4 of the total number of kids in camp):

\[ \text{Total kids in camp} = 3000 \times 4 = 12000 \]

So, there are 12000 kids in camp altogether.

system
Let's denote the total number of kids in camp as \( T \).

According to the information given, half of the kids are going to soccer camp. Therefore, the number of kids going to soccer camp is \( \frac{1}{2}T \).

Next, we know that 1/4 of the kids in soccer camp are going in the morning, which means 3/4 of the kids in soccer camp are going in the afternoon because 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

We are told that 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2}T = 750 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ \frac{3}{8}T = 750 \]
\[ T = 750 \times \frac{8}{3} \]
\[ T = 2500 \]

So, there are 2500 kids in camp altogether.

system
Let's denote the total number of kids in camp as \( T \).

According to the problem, half of the kids are going to soccer camp, so the number of kids going to soccer camp is \( \frac{T}{2} \).

Furthermore, 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going in the morning, so the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \).

Since 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon, the total number of kids going to soccer camp is the sum of those going in the morning and those in the afternoon:
\[ \frac{T}{8} + 750 = \frac{T}{2} \]

Now, we can solve for \( T \):
\[ 750 = \frac{T}{2} - \frac{T}{8} \]
\[ 750 = \frac{4T - T}{8} \]
\[ 750 = \frac{3T}{8} \]
\[ 6000 = 3T \]
\[ T = 2000 \]

So, there are 2000 kids in camp altogether.

To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of kids in camp as \( x \).

1. Half of the kids are going to soccer camp: \( \frac{x}{2} \) kids.
2. 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going to soccer camp in the morning: \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{8} \) kids in the morning.
3. The remaining kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon: \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{8} \).

We are given that 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{8} = 750 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{4x - x}{8} = 750 \]
\[ \frac{3x}{8} = 750 \]
\[ 3x = 750 \times 8 \]
\[ 3x = 6000 \]
\[ x = \frac{6000}{3} \]
\[ x = 2000 \]

So, there are 2000 kids in camp altogether.

<reasoning>
Let's assume the total number of kids in camp is \( x \).
According to the problem, half of the kids are going to soccer camp. So, the number of kids going to soccer camp is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

Out of these kids going to soccer camp, 1/4 are going in the morning. Therefore, 3/4 are going in the afternoon.

Given that 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon, this 3/4 corresponds to 750 kids. We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{x}{2} = 750 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{3x}{8} = 750 \]
\[ 3x = 750 \times 8 \]
\[ 3x = 6000 \]
\[ x = \frac{6000}{3} \]
\[ x = 2000 \]

So, the total number of kids in camp is 2000.

Let's denote the total number of kids in camp as \( T \).

First, we know that half of the kids are going to soccer camp. Therefore, the number of kids going to soccer camp is:
\[ \frac{T}{2} \]

Next, we know that 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going to soccer camp in the morning. So, the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \]

The remaining kids going to soccer camp are in the afternoon. We are given that 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning plus the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon equals the total number of kids going to soccer camp:
\[ \frac{T}{8} + 750 = \frac{T}{2} \]

To solve for \( T \), we first eliminate the denominators by multiplying every term by 8:
\[ T + 6000 = 4T \]

Rearranging the equation to isolate \( T \):
\[ 6000 = 4T - T \]
\[ 6000 = 3T \]
\[ T = 2000 \]

So, the total number of kids in camp is 2000.

Let's denote the total number of kids in camp as \( x \).

According to the problem, half of the kids are going to soccer camp, so the number of kids going to soccer camp is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of those going to soccer camp, so it is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{8} \).

The number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon is 750. Since these are the remaining kids after accounting for those going in the morning, we have:

\[ \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{8} = 750 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ \frac{4x - x}{8} = 750 \]
\[ \frac{3x}{8} = 750 \]
\[ 3x = 750 \times 8 \]
\[ 3x = 6000 \]

Let's denote the total number of kids in camp as \( T \). 

Given that \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the kids attending soccer camp are going in the morning, that means \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the kids attending soccer camp are going in the afternoon. We know that directly \( 750 \) kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon.

So, \( \frac{3}{4}T \) kids are going to soccer camp in total, and out of this, \( 750 \) are in the afternoon. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{3}{4}T = 750 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{4 \times 750}{3} = 3333.33 \]

Since the number of kids cannot be a decimal, let's recheck the fractional parts and round accordingly. The total number of kids will be calculated as:

\[ T = 4 \times (Number\ of\ kids\ in\ the\ afternoon) / 3 \]
\[ T = 4 \times 750 / 3 \]
\[ T = 1000 \]

So, let's verify by plugging this into the original condition:

- Total kids \( T = 1000 \)
- Kids in soccer camp \( = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \)
- Morning soccer campers \( = \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \)
- Afternoon soccer campers \( = 500 - 125 = 375 \)

However, the correct approach considering the constraint mentioned (750 kids in afternoon) should be rechecked for consistency. The correct calculation considering fractions directly:

\[ \text{Morning soccer campers} = \frac{3}{4} T = 750 \]
\[ T = \frac{3 \times 750}{3} = 750 \times \frac{4}{3} = 1000 \]

Thus, the total number of kids in camp is \( 1000 \).

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine the total number of kids in camp. Let's denote the total number of kids as \( T \).

According to the problem, 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are in the morning. Therefore, 3/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are in the afternoon.

We know that 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon, which is 3/4 of the total kids going to soccer camp.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total Kids Going to Soccer Camp} = 750 \]

From this, we can solve for the total number of kids going to soccer camp:
\[ \text{Total Kids Going to Soccer Camp} = \frac{750}{3/4} \]
\[ \text{Total Kids Going to Soccer Camp} = \frac{750 \times 4}{3} \]
\[ \text{Total Kids Going to Soccer Camp} = 250 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total Kids Going to Soccer Camp} = 1000 \]

Now we know the total number of kids going to soccer camp. Since half of the kids are going to soccer camp, the total number of kids in camp is:
\[ 2 \times 1000 = 2000 \]

Therefore, there are 2000 kids in camp altogether.

system
Let's denote the total number of kids in the camp as \( N \). According to the problem, half of the kids are going to soccer camp, so the number of kids going to soccer camp is \( \frac{N}{2} \). Out of these kids, \( \frac{1}{4} \) are going to soccer camp in the morning, which means the rest, \( \frac{3}{4} \), are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. The problem states that there are 750 kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{N}{2} = 750
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

1. Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{N}{2} = \frac{3N}{8}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{3N}{8} = 750
\]

2. To find \( N \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{8}{3} \):

\[
N = 750 \cdot \frac{8}{3} = 750 \cdot \frac{8}{3} = 250 \cdot 8 = 2000
\]

Thus, the total number of kids in the camp is \( 2000 \).

Let's denote the total number of kids in the camp as \( N \).

First, it is given that half of the kids are going to soccer camp:
\[ \frac{N}{2} \]

Next, it is stated that 1/4 of the kids in soccer camp are going to soccer camp in the morning:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{N}{2} = \frac{N}{8} \]

If 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon, then the total number of kids in soccer camp is the sum of those going in the morning and afternoon:
\[ \frac{N}{8} + 750 = N \]

Now we can solve for \( N \):
\[ \frac{N}{8} = N - 750 \]

Multiply both sides by 8 to clear the fraction:
\[ N = 8N - 6000 \]

Rearrange to isolate \( N \):
\[ 6000 = 7N \]

So:
\[ N = \frac{6000}{7} \approx 857.14 \]

Since the number of kids must be a whole number, let's round to the nearest whole number:
\[ N \approx 857 \]

We can verify:
\[ \frac{857}{8} \approx 107.125 \]
\[ 7 \times 107.125 = 749.9375 \]
\[ 857 - 749.9375 = 107.0625 \]

This verifies the rounding, but let's proceed with the exact calculation:

\[ N = 857 \]

So, there are approximately 858 kids in the camp (428 in soccer camp, 387 in soccer camp in the morning, and 750 in soccer camp in the afternoon).

Let's denote the total number of kids in camp as \( T \).

Step 1: Determine the number of kids going to soccer camp.
\[ \text{Kids going to soccer camp} = \frac{1}{2} T \]

Step 2: Determine the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning.
\[ \text{Kids going to soccer camp in the morning} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Kids going to soccer camp} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} T = \frac{1}{8} T \]

Step 3: Determine the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon.
\[ \text{Kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon} = 750 \]

Since the total number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning and afternoon should sum up to the total number of kids going to soccer camp, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{1}{8} T + 750 = \frac{1}{2} T \]

Step 4: Solve for \( T \).
\[ \frac{1}{8} T + 750 = \frac{1}{2} T \]
\[ 750 = \frac{1}{2} T - \frac{1}{8} T \]
\[ 750 = \frac{4}{8} T - \frac{1}{8} T \]
\[ 750 = \frac{3}{8} T \]
\[ T = \frac{750 \times 8}{3} \]
\[ T = 250 \times 8 \]
\[ T = 2000 \]

So, the total number of kids in camp is 2000.
