###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Robi Ney wants to fill a 120-liter tub. He is amused by letting the water run for 1 minute, then closing the water supply for 1 minute, and so on alternating opening and closing the water supply. But the cap at the bottom of the tub is not very airtight and lets 1 liter of water escape per minute. The flow rate of the tap is 12 liters per minute. How long does it take to fill the tub in minutes?

<reasoning>
Robi Ney alternates between opening and closing the water supply for 1 minute each time. Each cycle (opening the tap, closing the tap, opening the tap, etc.) takes 2 minutes. However, the tub loses 1 liter of water per minute, regardless of whether the tap is open or closed.

During the 2 minutes of each cycle, water flows into the tub at a rate of 12 liters per minute. So for the first cycle, 12 liters enter the tub during the first minute and 0 liters during the second minute, resulting in a net gain of 12 liters. This pattern repeats for each cycle.

To fill the tub, the net gain in water must equal the total capacity of the tub, but since water is leaking out at a rate of 1 liter per minute, we need to account for this loss as well. Therefore, the effective net gain per cycle is 12 - 1 = 11 liters per cycle.

We can calculate the number of cycles required by dividing the tub's capacity by the effective net gain per cycle:
\[ \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{\text{Tub's capacity}}{\text{Effective net gain per cycle}} = \frac{120}{11} \]

Since each cycle takes 2 minutes, we multiply the number of cycles by 2 to find the total time.

Let's calculate the exact number of cycles:
\[ \text{Number of cycles} \approx 10.9091 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a cycle, we take the ceiling of this value, which means we need to complete 11 cycles to ensure the tub is filled.

So, the total time to fill the tub is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 11 \times 2 = 22 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, it will take approximately 22 minutes to fill the tub.

Letâ€™s break down the problem step by step:
1. The flow rate of the tap is 12 liters per minute.
2. The tub can hold 120 liters.
3. The amount of water remaining in the tub after each cycle of 2 minutes is deducted by the rate of leakage (1 liter per minute).
4. When the cap is open, the net flow into the tub is \( 12 - 1 = 11 \) liters per minute.
5. After the 2-minute cycle, the tub is being refilled at 11 liters per minute, minus the 1 liter leaking per minute.
6. Over 5 cycles (10 minutes), the net amount drained by the leak is \( 10 \times 1 = 10 \) liters.
7. Therefore, after 10 minutes, the tub has \( 10 \times 12 - 10 = 110 \) liters in it.
8. At this point, the remaining 10 liters are filled by the tap, which operates at 11 liters per minute.

Thus, the total time taken to fill the tub is 10 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the net flow of water into the tub during each cycle of alternating opening and closing the water supply. During each cycle, the water fills the tub for 1 minute, but 1 liter escapes, effectively reducing the net filling by 1 liter per minute. 

Moreover, since the number of cycles required can vary, we need to consider the cumulative effect over a series of such cycles. Let's analyze the situation more closely.

1. **For every minute:** 120 liters of water are tried to flow into the tub, but 1 liter of water is lost.
2. Therefore, 119 liters actually fill the tub during each minute of operation.
3. However, since each cycle starts with the tap open:
4. So, after the first cycle, the amount of water that has filled the tub is:
   \( 119 \text{ liters} \).
5. Then, after the second cycle, the amount of water filled will again be:
   \( 119 \text{ liters} \).

This means the tub will be completely filled in 2 cycles. 

6. So, the total time taken is \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time taken to fill the tub is \( 2 \) minutes.

Now, let's verify this solution by plugging the numbers into a more detailed calculation.

<answer>

</answer>
<reasoning>
Throughout the reasoning, we identified that each cycle (alternating between opening and closing the tap) results in a net filling of 119 liters. Thus, the tub gets filled in 2 full cycles. Summarizing:
First Cycle: 119 liters
Second Cycle: 119 liters
Total Time: \(2 \times 1 = 2\) minutes.

Thus, the time taken to fill the tub is \(2\) minutes.

Let's break down the process and calculate the net change in water volume per cycle.

1. The tap fills the tub at a rate of 12 liters per minute.
2. Water escapes from the tub at a rate of 1 liter per minute due to the dripping.
3. Therefore, the net rate at which the tub fills is \(12 - 1 = 11\) liters per minute.

Next, we need to determine how many entire cycles fit into the tub's capacity:

1. Calculate the time to fill one cycle: \( \frac{120 \text{ liters}}{11 \text{ liters/minute}} \approx 10.91 \) minutes.
2. Since each cycle consists of 2 minutes (1 minute of filling and 1 minute of dripping), we round up to 11 minutes for the first cycle, which is enough to fill the tub.

Now, let's account for the last minute of the final cycle that may be less than a complete cycle:

1. After \(10.91\) minutes of one full cycle, Robi needs to check the remaining water level and complete the cycle in the last minute to ensure the tub is full.
2. After 10.91 minutes, the net filled water volume is: \( 120 - 11 \times 10.91 \approx 3.9 \text{ liters} \).
3. In the final minute of the cycle, the taps are opened and closed, filling the tub completely with: \( 1 \text{ liter} \).
4. Therefore, the final water level is checked with \( 3.9 + 1 = 4.9 \text{ liters} \).

So, Robi takes approximately 11 minutes in the first cycle and the final minute to fully fill the tub.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there is not any water in the tub.
2. When the water supply is opened, 12 liters of water are added to the tub in the first minute. However, since the cap leaks 1 liter per minute, only 11 liters will be added.
3. The cycle then repeats: 1 minute with 12 liters incoming and 1 liter leaking out, resulting in 11 liters in.
4. This pattern continues.

To find how long it takes, we need to determine after how many complete cycles (including the final partial cycle) the tub will be filled with 120 liters.

Each cycle (one opening and one closing) adds 11 liters. 
Therefore, after 10 complete cycles, the total water added is 10 * 11 = 110 liters.
Adding the water from the first opening (which is 12 liters), the total is 110 + 12 = 122 liters.

However, since we need to reach exactly 120 liters, and the next cycle will add only 11 liters, we need to account for the final partial cycle.

We can calculate the time needed to fill the remaining 5 liters (120 - 122 + 12 = 120 - 122 + 12):

5 liters need to be added in the 11th full cycle. 
In the 11th minute, the water supply is opened. The 1 liter leak means only 11 liters will be added.
12 liters were already added from the first cycle, and the remaining 5 liters need to be filled by the 11th minute.

Since the 3rd iteration already gave 11 liters and we start from fresh, we only need to calculate the third iteration (after the initial 11 liters from the first cycle).

So, the time taken is 2 minutes for the first 11 liters and 1 liter leakage.
Therefore, after 2 minutes, 12 liters are added, and after the third iteration, 1 liter is added, making a total of 13 liters in the tub.

To top this up, we simply need another 26 liters (120 - 13) which would require another 2 minutes with 1 liter of water being added due to leakage.

Thus, it takes 4 minutes in total to fill the tub.

Hence, the total time is 4 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the net effect of each cycle of running the tap and closing it, and the leakage from the bottom of the tub.

1. During each cycle (1 minute of running and 1 minute of closing), the tap fills the tub with 12 liters of water and 1 liter escapes due to the leakage.
2. So, the net increase in water in the tub per cycle is \(12 - 1 = 11\) liters.
3. After alternating between running and closing the tap for 11 cycles, the total net increase in water would be \(11 \times 11 = 121\) liters.
4. Since our net increase is more than 120 liters, during the 11th cycle, the tub would fill completely and have an extra 1 liter.
5. So, at the end of the 11th cycle, we have 120 liters in the tub.

Since the cycle completes in 2 minutes, it takes 22 minutes to fill the tub because the tub is filled in 11 cycles and the last cycle is partially filled.

Therefore, the total time to fill the tub is 22 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the net effect of Robi Ney's alternating flushing of the tub and the water escaping due to the leak. Let's break it down step by step:

1. During the first minute, the tap fills the tub at a rate of 12 liters per minute.
2. However, 1 liter of water escapes due to the leak.
3. Therefore, the net addition of water in the first minute is \(12 - 1 = 11\) liters.

4. In the second minute, the water stops flowing and the tub is left with \(11\) liters from the first minute plus the additional 1 liter that escaped due to the leak, making a total of \(12\) liters.

5. In the third minute, the tap fills the tub again at a rate of 12 liters per minute, but 1 liter escapes, so the net addition is \(12 - 1 = 11\) liters.

6. This pattern continues, with the net addition of water being 11 liters each time.

7. The tub is full when the cumulative net addition reaches 120 liters.

8. We can set up an equation to find how many 11-liter increments are needed to reach 120 liters:
\[ 11n = 120 \]

9. Solving for \(n\):
\[ n = \frac{120}{11} \approx 10.91 \]

10. Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number because even 10 increments would only amount to \(110\) liters, which is less than 120.

11. Therefore, \( n = 11 \).

12. Each cycle (minute cycle) consists of 12 minutes for 11 liters added (net gain) and 1 minute of 11 liters added, making the total time for 11 cycles:
\[ 11 \times 12 \text{ minutes} = 132 \text{ minutes} \]

13. The 1 hour 2 minutes (132 minutes) is not a whole number, so we add the final cycle of 11 liters being added:
\[ 132 + 11 = 143 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take Robi Ney 143 minutes to fill the tub.

Let's analyze the process step by step.

1. Robi Ney lets the water run for 1 minute, which fills 12 liters.
2. He then closes the water supply for 1 minute, and the 120-liter tub loses 1 liter to the air, resulting in a net loss of 11 liters.
3. He repeats this cycle, alternating between filling and draining, and it continues until the tub is full.

The key here is the 11-liter net loss caused by the inefficiency of the cap. The tub starts having 0 liters and increases by 12 liters every two minutes (one minute filling and one minute draining, minus the 1 liter loss from the cap).

To find out how much the tub needs to be filled after the initial net loss, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Total capacity} - \text{Net loss} = \text{Filling rate} \times \text{Time to fill} \]

\[ 120 - 11 = 12 \times \text{Time} \]

\[ 109 = 12 \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{109}{12} \approx 9.08 \text{ minutes} \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a minute in this context, we will round to the nearest whole number. So, he will have nearly completed the last full minute of the cycle, which will fill the remaining 9 liters.

Therefore, the total time to fill the tub is approximately 9 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the net effect of the water flow and evaporation over each alternating cycle of opening and closing the water supply.

1. **Initial Flow and Evaporation:**
   - Water flow rate = 12 liters/minute.
   - Evaporation rate = 1 liter/minute.
   - Net flow rate when the water supply is on: \( 12 - 1 = 11 \) liters/minute.

2. **One Complete Cycle (Pair of Minutes):**
   - In 2 minutes:
     - The first minute with the water supply on: \( 12 \) liters.
     - Net flow rate for the first minute: \( 11 \) liters.
     - The second minute without the water supply: \( 1 \) liter.
     - Total water in the tub: \( 12 + 1 = 13 \) liters.

3. **Further Cycles:**
   - Each subsequent pair of minutes will add more water to the tub.
   - The evolution of the tub fill can be seen as the harmonic series diverging, but we need to find the exact time to fill the tub.

4. **Analyzing the Final Cycle:**
   - Let's understand the final few cycles:
     - After the first 2 minutes, the tub has 13 liters.
     - After the next pair of 2 minutes, 13 liters again.
     - This repeats until the tub is full.
     - However, since the tub is 120 liters, let's see how it happens:
       - For 10 cycles, we add \( 10 \times 13 = 130 \) liters.
       - And in the 11th cycle, we add only \( 1 \) liter to reach:
         \[
         130 + 1 = 131 \text{ liters}.
         \]

5. **Exact Calculation:**
   - Each pair of minutes adds 13 liters.
   - We need 10 full cycles plus the 11th cycle to reach 120 liters.
   - Total time from first cycle of 11 minutes (for 11 more liters), then additional 1 minute for the 11th full cycle:
     \[
     11 \text{ pairs} + 1 \text{ minute} = 11 \times 2 + 1 = 23 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

6. **Verification:**
   - Verify each step to ensure we reach the target.
     - 23 cycles (11 minutes) initially fill it 11 times up to 131 liters, then the last minute fills the remaining 10 liters.

Robi Ney alternates between letting the water run for 1 minute and closing the water supply for 1 minute. Each of these 1-minute intervals leads to a net loss of 1 liter per minute due to water leaking through the cap. 

In each cycle (1 minute open and 1 minute closed), 12 liters of water are added to the tub. However, because of the leaking, only 11 liters (12 - 1) get into the tub during each cycle. 

At the end of 6 cycles (each comprising 1 open and 1 closed minute with 1 liter of water loss per cycle), Robi will have added \(6 \times 11 = 66\) liters to the tub. 

After 6 cycles, he adds \(66 \times 12 = 792\) liters to the tub. However, at this point, 66 liters have leaked out. So, he is left with \(792 - 66 = 726\) liters in the tub.

Since he adds 12 liters every minute and he has 726 liters left, the number of minutes he takes to fill the remaining tub is \(\frac{726}{12} = 60.5\).

Therefore, the total time, considering the start of a cycle, is \(60 + 0.5 = 60.5\).

So, it takes 60.5 minutes.

In the first minute, Robi Ney will fill 12 liters of water into the tub because the tap is open and there is no water escaping. After the first minute, 1 liter of water will escape, leaving 11 liters in the tub. 

The second minute, the tap will start again and fill another 12 liters, but again 1 liter will escape, leaving 11 liters in the tub. This pattern continues every minute.

Therefore, every 2 minutes, the tub gains 12 liters (because 12 liters from the tap minus 1 liter leaking out equals 11 liters filled). 

We now need to determine how many such 2-minute cycles are needed to fill the tub. 

First, we find out how much water is accumulated over 2 minutes: 
\[ 2 \text{ minutes} \times 11 \text{ liters/2 minutes} = 22 \text{ liters} \]

Next, to fill the remaining 98 liters (since 120 - 22 = 98), we need 5 more cycles of 2 minutes each because:
\[ 5 \text{ cycles} \times 11 \text{ liters} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

So, 5 more cycles will add 55 liters, leaving us with:
\[ 98 \text{ liters} - 55 \text{ liters} = 43 \text{ liters} \]

Since one more cycle of 2 minutes is needed to fill a total of 43 liters (which means the 43rd liter will come in the 9th minute when the next cycle starts, because 43/12) then the total time will be 10 minutes (5 full cycles of 2 minutes) with the 9th minute when the tub has less than 43 liters left. 

Therefore, the tub will be filled in 10 minutes.

To determine how long it takes to fill the tub, we need to analyze the process step by step.

First, let's break down the water flow:
- The tap fills the tub at a rate of 12 liters per minute.
- However, 1 liter of water escapes through the cap per minute.

So, the net flow of water per minute is:
\[ 12 \text{ liters/min} - 1 \text{ liter/min} = 11 \text{ liters/min} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes to fill 120 liters of water with a net flow of 11 liters per minute. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Net flow rate}} = \frac{120 \text{ liters}}{11 \text{ liters/min}} = \frac{120}{11} \text{ minutes} \approx 10.91 \text{ minutes} \]

However, since the time is typically expressed as a whole number of minutes in common scenarios, we need to check if the time exceeds or is just slightly less than 11 minutes. Let's confirm this by calculating the actual times of filling:

- In the first minute, the tub is filled by 12 liters (12 liters/min * 1 minute).
- In the second minute, the tub is filled by 1 liter (1 liter/min * 1 minute, but 1 liter escapes, so only 11 liters).
- In the third minute, the tub is filled by 12 liters (12 liters/min * 1 minute).
- In the fourth minute, the tub is filled by 1 liter (1 liter/min * 1 minute, but 1 liter escapes, so only 11 liters).
- And so on.

We can see that the net increase in the volume of water in one 1-minute cycle is 11 liters. Therefore, to fill 120 liters, we need:
\[ \frac{120}{11} \approx 10.91 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the time must be a whole number of minutes, and the net increase in volume per cycle is exactly 11 liters, the tub will be filled in 11 minutes. This is because the 11th minute will complete the last 1 liter and the 12th minute will start again.

Thus, the time taken to fill the tub is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the net effect of each cycle of opening and closing the water supply.

1. **Net effect of one cycle:**
   - During the first minute, the water flows in at 12 liters.
   - During the second minute, the water flows in at 12 liters.
   - During the third minute, the water flows out (12 liters), but when the supply is closed, 1 liter escapes per minute.
   - During the fourth minute, the water flows in at 12 liters.

   So, in each cycle (lasting 2 minutes), the net increase in water volume is:
   \[
   12 + 12 - 12 - 1 = 11 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. **Number of cycles in 120 liters:**
   - Since the net increase per cycle is 11 liters, to reach 120 liters, we need:
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ liters}}{11 \text{ liters per cycle}} \approx 10.90 \text{ cycles}
   \]
   Since we can only have whole cycles, we round up to 11 cycles.

3. **Total time:**
   - Each cycle takes 2 minutes, so for 11 cycles:
   \[
   11 \times 2 = 22 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final check for the last minute:**
   - After 21 minutes, the tub would be filled to:
   \[
   120 - (11 \times 11) = 120 - 121 = -1 \text{ liter}
   \]
   - In the 22nd minute, the water will fill the tub in 1 minute because the tub will be under the water flow.

So, the total time to fill the tub is 22 minutes.

To determine how long it takes to fill the 120-liter tub, we need to consider the following details:

1. The flow rate of the tap is 12 liters per minute.
2. During each cycle (opening and closing the tap), 1 liter of water escapes the tub.
3. The total time for a single cycle (opening and closing the tap) is 2 minutes.

Let's analyze the situation:

- In one minute of alternating operation (1 minute with the tap open and 1 minute with the tap closed), 11 liters of water are added to the tub because 1 liter escapes.
- However, in each complete cycle (2 minutes), 1 liter escapes during the closing part. But the cycle itself doesn't contribute to any net liquid volume added to the tub during the closing part (it's a net loss of 1 liter).

So, to add 1 liter to the tub in one cycle, we need to do 1 liter + 1 liter = 2 liters.

Now, let's calculate how many cycles are needed to fill the tub:

\[
\text{Liters needed to fill tub} = 120 \text{ liters}
\]
\[
\text{Liters per cycle} = 2 \text{ liters}
\]

\[
\text{Number of cycles required} = \frac{120 \text{ liters}}{2 \text{ liters/cycle}} = 60 \text{ cycles}
\]

Since each cycle takes 2 minutes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 60 \text{ cycles} \times 2 \text{ minutes/cycle} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it takes 120 minutes to fill the 120-liter tub, considering the alternating flow with loss.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.
1. When the tap is open, water is flowing into the tub. Every minute, the tub fills with 12 liters of water. However, 1 liter of water leaks out through the cap, so the effective rate of water being added to the tub is 12 liters - 1 liter = 11 liters per minute.
2. When the tap is closed, the tub does not fill with any water, but it still loses 1 liter per minute due to the leak.
3. We need to find out how long it takes to fill the tub, considering both the water being added and the water leaking out per minute.

Let's calculate for the first minute:
- After 1 minute (tap open), the tub is 12 liters (since the initial volume is zero)
- After 1 minute (tap closed), the tub loses 1 liter (due to the leak) and the total volume is 11 liters
- We continue this alternating pattern (1 minute open, 1 minute closed, and so on) until the tub reaches or exceeds 120 liters.

Let's do the math for the next few minutes to see the pattern:
- After the second minute (tap open): The tub is now 23 liters (12 + 11) and loses 1 liter due to the leak, so the current volume is 22 liters.
- After the third minute (tap closed): The tub is now 22 liters and loses 1 liter, so the new volume is 21 liters.

This pattern continues until we reach or exceed 120 liters. We need 120 - 20 = 100 liters to reach the full volume. Since it takes 120 liters to fill the tub, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to reach 100 liters.

Let's calculate the time it takes to reach 100 liters:
- From 22 liters to 100 liters, we need to add 78 liters (100 - 22 = 78).
- Since the effective rate is 11 liters per minute, it will take 78 / 11 = 7.09 minutes to add the remaining 78 liters.

The total time is the initial time plus the time to reach 100 liters:
- Initial time (first cycle): 1 minute
- Time to reach 100 liters (7.09 minutes)

Total time = 1 + 7.09 = 8.09 minutes

So, it takes approximately 8.09 minutes to fill the tub.

To solve this problem, let's first understand the net change in water level per cycle of the alternating watering process. 

1. In 1 minute, the tap adds 12 liters of water.
2. In the subsequent 1 minute, the cap lets 1 liter of water escape.
3. Thus, each cycle results in a net change of \( 12 - 1 = 11 \) liters.

To fill a 120-liter tub using these alternating cycles, we need to determine the total number of cycles required to reach or exceed 120 liters.

\[ 11 \text{ liters per cycle} \times (x \text{ cycles required}) \geq 120 \text{ liters} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x \times 11 \geq 120 \]
\[ x \geq \frac{120}{11} \]
\[ x \geq 10.909... \]

Since the number of cycles must be a whole number, and we need to ensure the tub is fully filled, we round up to the next whole number, which is 11 cycles. 

In these 11 cycles, the total water added would be:

\[ 11 \text{ cycles} \times 11 \text{ liters per cycle} = 121 \text{ liters} \]

Considering the 120-liter tub is a full container, and we have accounted for 121 liters in 11 cycles, it is certain that all the water will be added before the cycles end.

Therefore, the total time required is \( 11 \text{ minutes} \) to complete 11 cycles.

11 cycles of 1 minute each will take 11 minutes.

In conclusion, it takes 11 minutes to fill the 120-liter tub.
