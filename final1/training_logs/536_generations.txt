To calculate the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the hourly wage of the experienced sailors.
2. Calculate the total weekly earnings of an experienced sailor.
3. Calculate the total monthly earnings of an experienced sailor.
4. Multiply the total weekly earnings by the number of experienced sailors to get the monthly earnings.

Step 1: Determine the hourly wage of the experienced sailors.
The experienced sailors are paid 1/5 times more than the inexperienced sailors. Since the inexperienced sailors are paid $10 per hour, the experienced sailors' hourly wage can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Hourly wage of experienced sailor} = 10 + \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 10 + 2 = 12 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total weekly earnings of an experienced sailor.
The experienced sailors work 60 hours a week, so their total weekly earnings are:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings of experienced sailor} = 12 \times 60 = 720 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total monthly earnings of an experienced sailor.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total monthly earnings of an experienced sailor are:
\[ \text{Monthly earnings of experienced sailor} = 720 \times 4 = 2880 \]

Step 4: Multiply the total weekly earnings by the number of experienced sailors to get the monthly earnings.
The crew consists of 17 sailors in total, with 5 of them being inexperienced. Therefore, the number of experienced sailors is:
\[ 17 - 5 = 12 \]
The total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors are:
\[ \text{Total combined monthly earnings of experienced sailors} = 12 \times 2880 = 34560 \]

Thus, the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors is:
\[ \boxed{34560} \]

Since each experienced sailor was paid 1/5 times more than the inexperienced sailors, each experienced sailor was paid $10 + 1/5 * $10 = $12 per hour.

Since there were 12 hours in a workday, each experienced sailor was paid $12 * 12 = $144 per day.

Since there are 4 workdays in a workweek, each experienced sailor was paid $144 * 4 = $576 per workweek.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, each experienced sailor was paid $576 * 4 = $2304 per month.

Since there were 5 inexperienced sailors and each paid $10 per hour for a 60-hour workweek, the total monthly earnings of the inexperienced sailors were 5 * $10 * 60 = $3000.

Therefore, the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors would be 2304 * 17 - 3000 = $35,112.

1. **Calculate the hourly wage of an inexperienced sailor:**
   - Inexperienced sailors are paid $10 per hour.
   - Monthly earnings of an inexperienced sailor:
     \[
     \text{Monthly earnings} = 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 60 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month}
     \]
     \[
     = 10 \times 60 \times 4 = 2400 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]

2. **Determine the hourly wage of an experienced sailor:**
   - Each experienced sailor is paid \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more than the inexperienced sailor.
   - Hourly wage of an experienced sailor:
     \[
     \text{Hourly wage of experienced sailor} = 10 \text{ dollars/hour} + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 10\right) \text{ dollars/hour}
     \]
     \[
     = 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars/hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the monthly earnings of one experienced sailor:**
   - Monthly earnings of one experienced sailor:
     \[
     \text{Monthly earnings} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 60 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month}
     \]
     \[
     = 12 \times 60 \times 4 = 2880 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]

First, let's calculate the daily earnings of the inexperienced sailors for a 60-hour workweek:

Inexperienced sailors' hourly wage = $10
Inexperienced sailors' daily wage = $10/hour * 60 hours = $600
Inexperienced sailors' weekly wage = $600/week * 4 weeks = $2400

The experienced sailors are paid 1/5 times more than the inexperienced sailors. So the hourly wage for an experienced sailor would be:

Experience wage multiplier = (1 + 1/5) = 1.2

So the daily wage for an experienced sailor would be:

$600 * 1.2 = $720
The weekly wage for an experienced sailor would be:

$720 * 4 weeks = $2880

Next, to find the total combined monthly earnings, we need to calculate what a sailor would earn per month and then multiply by the number of experienced sailors.

Assuming an experienced sailor works 20% over the usual 60-hour workweek due to the shipping situation (though this isn't explicitly stated in the problem, we'll take this as a given), the overtime hours would be equal to the number of usual hours plus 20% of that number:

Overtime hours = 60 hours * 20% = 12 hours
Overtime wage multiplier = 1 + 1/5 = 1.2

So, the hourly wage for an experienced sailor working overtime would be:

Overtime hourly wage = $720 * 1.2 = $864

The weekly overtime wages for experienced sailors would be:

Overtime weekly wage = $864 * 4 weeks * 1.16 (20% overtime multiplier) = $4105.6

Then the monthly overtime wage for experienced sailors would be:

$4105.6 * 4 weeks * 4 months = $65329.6

Finally, to get the total monthly earnings, we add the usual weekly wage and the overtime weekly wage and simplify:

Total monthly earnings = (2880 * 4) + (4105.6 * 4) = $11520 + $16422.4 = $27942.4

So, the total monthly combined earnings of the experienced sailors would be $27942.4.

     10 + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 10\right) = 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings of a single experienced sailor:**
   - Working 60 hours per week, the weekly earnings for one experienced sailor are:
     \[
     12 \text{ dollars per hour} \times 60 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ dollars per week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the monthly earnings of a single experienced sailor:**
   - Assuming there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the monthly earnings for one experienced sailor are:
     \[
     720 \text{ dollars per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2880 \text{ dollars per month}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of experienced sailors:**
   - There are 17 sailors in total, with 5 being inexperienced.
   - Therefore, the number of experienced sailors is:
     \[
     17 - 5 = 12 \text{ experienced sailors}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors:**
   - Each experienced sailor earns $2880 per month.
   - The total combined monthly earnings for 12 experienced sailors are:

Let's denote the hourly wage of the experienced sailors as \( x \). According to the problem, the experienced sailors are paid \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more than the inexperienced sailors. Therefore, the hourly wage of the experienced sailors is:

\[ x = 10 + \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The inexperienced sailors are paid $10 per hour for a 60-hour workweek. So, the total earnings of the inexperienced sailors in a week is:

\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 5 inexperienced sailors, their total weekly earnings are:

\[ 5 \times 600 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors. We don't have the number of experienced sailors, but since the problem asks for the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors, we can express the total earnings of the experienced sailors as \( 17 \times x \times \text{number of experienced sailors} \).

However, we are not given the number of experienced sailors, so we cannot calculate the exact total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors. The problem as stated does not provide enough information to determine the number of experienced sailors or their hourly wage. 

Therefore, with the given information, it is not possible to calculate the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors.
