###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

The math questions in a contest are divided into three rounds: easy, average, and hard. There are corresponding points given for each round. That is 2, 3, and 5 points for every correct answer in the easy, average, and hard rounds, respectively. Suppose Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy; 2 correct answers in the average; and 4 correct answers in the difficult round, what are her total points in the contest?

system
<reasoning>
To calculate Kim's total points in the contest, we need to multiply the number of correct answers she gave in each round by the points awarded for each correct answer in that round, and then sum up the points from all three rounds.

For the easy round:
- Kim got 6 correct answers.
- Each correct answer awards 2 points.
So, the points from the easy round are \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

For the average round:
- Kim got 2 correct answers.
- Each correct answer awards 3 points.
So, the points from the average round are \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

For the hard round:
- Kim got 4 correct answers.
- Each correct answer awards 5 points.
So, the points from the hard round are \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

Now, we sum the points from all three rounds: 
\(12 + 6 + 20 = 38\).

Therefore, Kim's total points in the contest are 38.

To calculate Kim's total points in the contest, we need to multiply the number of correct answers she got in each round by the corresponding points for that round and then sum up all the points.

For the easy round:
- Points per correct answer: 2
- Total points from the easy round: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \)

For the average round:
- Points per correct answer: 3
- Total points from the average round: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)

For the hard round:
- Points per correct answer: 5
- Total points from the hard round: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)

Now, we sum up all the points:
- Total points = Points from easy round + Points from average round + Points from hard round
- Total points = 12 + 6 + 20 = 38

Therefore, Kim's total points in the contest is 38.

To determine Kim's total points, we need to calculate the points she earned in each round and then sum them up.

1. **Easy Round:**
   - Points for each correct answer: 2
   - Kim's correct answers: 6
   - Total points from the easy round: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \)

2. **Average Round:**
   - Points for each correct answer: 3
   - Kim's correct answers: 2
   - Total points from the average round: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)

3. **Hard Round:**
   - Points for each correct answer: 5
   - Kim's correct answers: 4
   - Total points from the hard round: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)

Next, we add the points from all three rounds to find her total:

\[ 12 + 6 + 20 = 38 \]

Therefore, Kim's total points in the contest are **38**.

To find Kim's total points in the contest, we need to calculate the points she earned in each round and then add them together.

For the easy round:
Kim got 6 correct answers, and each correct answer is worth 2 points.
So, the points from the easy round are \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

For the average round:
Kim got 2 correct answers, and each correct answer is worth 3 points.
So, the points from the average round are \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

For the hard round:
Kim got 4 correct answers, and each correct answer is worth 5 points.
So, the points from the hard round are \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

Now, to find Kim's total points, we add the points from all three rounds:
\(12 + 6 + 20 = 38\).

Therefore, Kim's total points in the contest are 38.

To calculate Kim's total points, we'll multiply the number of correct answers in each round by the points given for that round, and then add up the totals.

For the easy round:
\( 6 \text{ correct answers} \times 2 \text{ points per correct answer} = 12 \text{ total points from easy round} \)

For the average round:
\( 2 \text{ correct answers} \times 3 \text{ points per correct answer} = 6 \text{ total points from average round} \)

For the hard round:
\( 4 \text{ correct answers} \times 5 \text{ points per correct answer} = 20 \text{ total points from hard round} \)

Now, we add up all the points from each round:

\( 12 \text{ from easy} + 6 \text{ from average} + 20 \text{ from hard} = 38 \text{ total points} \)

So, Kim's total points in the contest are 38.

   - Kim's correct answers: 6
   - Total points from the easy round: \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \)

2. **Average Round:**
   - Points for a correct answer: 3
   - Kim's correct answers: 2
   - Total points from the average round: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \)

3. **Hard Round:**
   - Points for a correct answer: 5
   - Kim's correct answers: 4
   - Total points from the hard round: \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)

4. **Total Points:**
