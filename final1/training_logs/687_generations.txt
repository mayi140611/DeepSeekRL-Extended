Chance boarded his plane from London at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday. The flight duration was 18 hours. So, if he arrived in New York around midnight on Tuesday (which is 18 hours after 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday), he would have arrived in New York around 12:00 midnight ET on Tuesday.

If he took another flight from New York to Cape Town arriving at 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, then his flight from New York to Cape Town took him from 12:00 midnight to 10:00 a.m. ET the day after. Therefore, from midnight (which is 0:00 ET) to 10:00 a.m. (which is 10:00 ET - 12:00 ET) is a total of 10 hours.

So, the number of hours his flight took from New York to Cape Town is 10 hours.

To determine the number of hours Chance's flight took from New York to Cape Town, we first need to calculate the time when Chance arrived in New York. Since he departed from London at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday and arrived in New York 18 hours later, we calculate the arrival time as follows:

1. Departure time from London: 6:00 a.m. ET
2. Add 18 hours to this departure time:
   - Start counting hours from 6:00 a.m. and go through additional hours until we reach 18 hours:
     - 6:00 a.m. + 1:00 hour = 7:00 a.m.
     - 7:00 a.m. + 2:00 hours = 9:00 a.m.
     - 9:00 a.m. + 3:00 hours = 12:00 p.m.
     - 12:00 p.m. + 4:00 hours = 2:00 p.m.
     - 2:00 p.m. + 5:00 hours = 7:00 p.m.
     - 7:00 p.m. + 6:00 hours = 1:00 a.m.
     - 1:00 a.m. + 7:00 hours = 8:00 a.m.
     - 8:00 a.m. + 8:00 hours = 4:00 p.m.
     - 4:00 p.m. + 9:00 hours = 1:00 a.m.
     - 1:00 a.m. + 10:00 hours = 10:00 a.m.
   So, the arrival time in New York is 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
   
3. The flight time from New York to Cape Town is the time difference between 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday and 10:00 a.m. ET on Monday.
   
4. Since both times are on the same day, the flight time from New York to Cape Town is 10 hours.

Chance boarded his plane at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday and arrived in New York 18 hours later. Let's first calculate the arrival time in New York. Since 6:00 a. m. ET on Monday and it takes 18 hours until his arrival time, we can calculate the arrival time as follows:
- Start: 6:00 a. m. ET on Monday
- Add 18 hours: 6:00 p. m. ET on Monday

So, the arrival time in New York is 6:00 p. m. ET on Monday.

Next, Chance took another flight to Cape Town the same day (Tuesday) from New York at 10:00 a. m. ET. Since New York is in the Eastern Time Zone and Cape Town is in the Eastern Standard Time Zone (UTC + 2), we need to convert the arrival time of 10:00 a. m. ET in the New York time zone to the Cape Town time zone.
- Convert 10:00 a. m. ET to UTC: 10:00 a. m. - 7 hours (since New York is 5 hours behind Cape Town) = 3:00 a. m. on Tuesday UTC
- Convert from UTC to Cape Town time (UTC + 2): 3:00 a. m. UTC + 2 hours = 5:00 a. m. the next day in Cape Town

So, Chance arrived in Cape Town at 5:00 a. m. on Wednesday.

To calculate the duration of his flight from New York to Cape Town, we need to subtract the arrival time at Cape Town from the departure time from New York:
- Departure time from New York: 10:00 a. m. ET on Tuesday
- Arrival time at Cape Town: 5:00 a. m. on Wednesday
- Duration: Wednesday, 5:00 a. m. to Tuesday, 10:00 a. m.  
- Duration = 19 hours (from Wednesday morning to Tuesday evening)

Therefore, Chance's flight from New York to Cape Town lasted 19 hours.

First, we need to determine the arrival time in New York. Chance boarded a plane departing from London to New York at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday. He arrived in New York 18 hours later. 

Arrival time in New York:
- Starting time: 6:00 a.m. ET
- Adding 18 hours: 6:00 a.m. + 18 hours = 20:00 a. m. ET or midnight on the next day (since 18 hours after 6:00 a.m. is 6:00 p. m. the previous day, and 6:00 p. m. is 6:00 a. m. of the next day).
- Since we are on Monday, adding a full day means it becomes Tuesday.

So, Chance arrived in New York at 10:00 a. m. ET on Tuesday.

Next, we need to determine the flight time from New York to Cape Town. We know:
- He arrived in New York at 10:00 a. m. ET on Tuesday.
- He then took another plane flying to Cape town from New York and arrived there at 10:00 a. m. ET on Wednesday.

The flight time from New York to Cape Town is simply the difference between these two time points, which is 24 hours (from 10:00 a. m. ET on Tuesday to 10:00 a. m. ET on Wednesday). 

Therefore, Chance's flight took 24 hours from New York to Cape Town.

18 hours from 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday is 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday, which means Chance arrived in New York at 6:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
Chance then took a flight from New York to Cape Town at 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday.

To find the duration of the flight from New York to Cape Town, we subtract the arrival time in New York from the departure time in New York:

10:00 a.m. - 6:00 a.m. = 4 hours.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the flight from London to New York and the flight from New York to Cape Town.

1. **Flight from London to New York**:
   - Chance boarded a plane departing from London at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday.
   - He arrived in New York 18 hours later. 
   - Therefore, he arrived at 6:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday after a 18-hour flight.

2. **Flight from New York to Cape Town**:
   - This flight was taken the day that Chance arrived in New York, which was Tuesday.

3. **Travel time from New York to Cape Town**:
   - Since Cape Town is located in Africa, it might have a different time zone.
   - However, the information provided only gives us the arrival time in New York (10:00 a. m ET on Tuesday) and does not specify the departure time from New York.

To calculate the flight time from New York to Cape Town, we need to know the departure time from New York. However, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact duration of the flight from New York to Cape Town.

Since the departure time is not specified, we cannot accurately calculate the flight time from New York to Cape Town.

Chance boarded the plane at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday and arrived in New York 18 hours later. Therefore, his arrival in New York was at 6:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday. He then took another plane to Cape Town on the same day and arrived at 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday.

To calculate the flight duration from New York to Cape Town, we need to determine the time difference between the departure and arrival times in New York. 

Start by identifying the time difference between Los Angeles and Cape Town. Generally, Los Angeles is approximately 12 hours behind Cape Town. 

If Chance boarded the flight in New York at 6:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, and it took 18 hours to reach New York from London, the flight would have departed from London at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday. 

So, if it's 6:00 p.m. ET in New York, adding 18 hours would put us in London, meaning the flight took 18 hours to reach New York, starting from London.

Now, to find the flight duration from New York to Cape Town, we subtract the arrival time in New York from the departure time in New York:
- Departure time in New York: 6:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday.
- Arrival time in New York: 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday.

Therefore, the flight duration from New York to Cape Town is:

The flight from London to New York started at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday and ended 18 hours later, so the flight took 18 hours. The flight from New York to Cape Town started on Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. ET and ended at a certain time, so we need to find out when it ended. We know that the total time for the trip from London to Cape Town is 18 hours, so we subtract the time from New York to Cape Town (10:00 a.m. to the end time) from 18 hours.

Let's assume the flight from New York to Cape Town arrived at 6:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday. To find the exact time, we subtract the 10:00 a.m. start time from the total 18 hours, which gives us 8 hours from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday. Therefore, his flight from London to Cape Town took 8 hours.

3. He then took a plane to Cape Town and arrived there at 10:00 a.m. ET on the following Tuesday.
4. We need to calculate the duration of his flight from New York to Cape Town.
5. From Monday to Tuesday, there are two days, each with 24 hours, so a total of 2 x 24 = 48 hours.
   
Hence, if he arrived at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, and considering the flight duration from London to New York is 6 hours and the subsequent flight from New York to Cape Town occurs over 48 hours, his flight from New York to Cape Town took 48 - 6 = 42 hours.

First, we need to determine when Chance arrived in New York. He departed from London to New York at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday and arrived 18 hours later. Therefore, the arrival time in New York would be:
\[ 6:00 \text{ a.m. ET on Monday} + 18 \text{ hours} = 6:00 \text{ p.m. ET on Monday} \]

Next, we know he flew from New York to Cape Town, which he arrived at 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday. To find the total travel time from New York to Cape Town, we need to calculate the difference between these two times. 

Starting from 6:00 p.m. ET on Monday, to 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, the time from Monday to Tuesday is 8 hours. 

However, since the flight started from 6:00 p.m. on Monday, the flight itself must have taken:
\[ 6:00 \text{ p.m. Monday} - 10:00 \text{ a.m. Tuesday} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

However, since the flight started on Monday at the end of the day and was meant to travel over the weekend, the actual departure time would need to be adjusted accordingly. Let's assume the flight took off at the start of the next day, i.e., at 12:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday (when he arrived at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday).

Now, let's calculate the total flight time from New York to Cape Town:
\[ 12:00 \text{ a.m. Tuesday} - 6:00 \text{ p.m. Monday} = 44 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the flight took 44 hours from New York to Cape Town.

To find the arrival time in New York, we add 18 hours to 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday. 18 hours on a standard calendar day means adding 14 hours to 6:00 a.m. and subtracting one hour, since days have 24 hours. So, 6:00 a.m. on Monday becomes 10:00 p.m. on Sunday.

This means he spent one whole day on the plane, flying from Monday to Sunday.

First, we note that his arrival in Cape Town was at 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday. Therefore, the time difference between New York and Cape Town would be calculated from 6:00 p.m. on Monday until 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday.

The calculation is as follows: 
10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. = 18 hours, and then add the 18 hours already traveled. 

So, it took 18 hours to fly to New York, and 18 hours more to fly from New York to Cape Town. 

The total time from the departure in New York to the arrival in Cape Town is 18 + 18 = 36 hours.
