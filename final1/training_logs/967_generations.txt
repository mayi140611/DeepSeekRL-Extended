system
<reasoning>
To determine the total number of floors in the building, we need to calculate the elevator's final position after all movements. 

1. The elevator starts on the 9th floor.
2. It goes down 7 floors: \(9 - 7 = 2\).
3. Then, it goes up 3 floors: \(2 + 3 = 5\).
4. Finally, it goes up 8 floors: \(5 + 8 = 13\).

Since the elevator ends up on the top floor, it must be on the 13th floor. Therefore, the building has 13 floors.

The elevator starts on the 9th floor. It first goes down 7 floors, so it is now on the 9 - 7 = 2nd floor. Then it goes up 3 floors, so it is now on the 2 + 3 = 5th floor. Finally, it goes up 8 floors, so it is now on the 5 + 8 = 13th floor. Therefore, the top floor of the building is the 13th floor.

To determine the total number of floors in the building, let's break down the elevator's movements:

1. The elevator starts on the 9th floor.
2. It goes down 7 floors: 9 - 7 = 2 floors.
3. It then goes up 3 floors: 2 + 3 = 5 floors.
4. Finally, it goes up 8 floors: 5 + 8 = 13 floors. 

Since the elevator ends on the top floor, it means the top floor is the 13th floor. Therefore, the building must have **14 floors**.

Let's denote the total number of floors in the building as F.

Initially, the elevator is on the 9th floor.

When it goes down 7 floors, it moves from the 9th floor to the 2nd floor (9 - 7 = 2).

Then, it goes up 3 floors, reaching the 5th floor (2 + 3 = 5).

Next, it goes up 8 floors, ending up on the 13th floor (5 + 8 = 13).

Since the elevator ends up on the top floor, we know F > 13.

Therefore, the building must have more than 13 floors.

Also, since the elevator started at the 9th floor and ended up at the 13th floor, the building must have at least 14 floors (as 9 is not the top floor).

Combining these two conditions, we can conclude that the building has 14 floors.

The elevator starts on the 9th floor. When it goes down 7 floors, it ends up on the 2nd floor (9 - 7 = 2). Then, when it goes up 3 floors, it ends up on the 5th floor (2 + 3 = 5). Finally, when it goes up 8 floors, it ends up on the 13th floor (5 + 8 = 13).

To find out how many floors are in the building, we need to determine the difference between the 9th floor and the 13th floor, which is 4 floors above the 9th floor. Since the elevator is on the top floor, this means there are 13 floors in total (the top floor is the 13th floor).

Therefore, the building has a total of 13 floors.

To determine the number of floors in the building, let's work backwards from the top floor where the elevator ends up.

1. The elevator ends up on the top floor, which means it has been on a few floors before reaching the top.
2. From the top floor, the elevator went up 8 floors to the 17th floor (9 + 8 = 17).
3. Before reaching the 17th floor, the elevator moved up 3 floors to the 14th floor (17 - 3 = 14).
4. Before reaching the 14th floor, the elevator moved down 7 floors to the 7th floor (14 - 7 = 7).
5. The elevator started on the 9th floor.

Now, we can calculate the number of floors in the building:

- Starting from the 9th floor.
- Going down 7 floors: 9 - 7 = 2 (so it is on the 2nd floor).
- Going up 3 floors: 2 + 3 = 5 (so it is on the 5th floor).
- Going up 8 floors: 5 + 8 = 13 (so it is on the 13th floor).

Therefore, the building has 13 floors.

To determine the top floor of the building, we need to calculate the net change in the elevator's position from the initial 9th floor.
1. The elevator goes down 7 floors: \(9 - 7 = 2\).
2. It then goes up 3 floors: \(2 + 3 = 5\).
3. Finally, it goes up 8 floors: \(5 + 8 = 13\).

Therefore, if the elevator reaches the top floor at the end, it means the top floor is 13th floor.

Conclusion: There are 13 floors in the building.

Let's calculate the final floor of the elevator step by step to determine the total number of floors in the building.

1. Start at the 9th floor.
2. Go down 7 floors: \( 9 - 7 = 2 \) floors.
3. Go up 3 floors: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) floors.
4. Go up 8 floors: \( 5 + 8 = 13 \) floors.

Since the elevator ends up on the top floor, and it started on the 9th floor, the building must have \( 13 - 1 = 12 \) floors in total.

Initially, the elevator is on the 9th floor. It goes down 7 floors, resulting in a new position at \(9 - 7 = 2\) floors. Then, it goes up 3 floors, reaching \(2 + 3 = 5\) floors. Finally, it goes up 8 more floors, ending up at \(5 + 8 = 13\) floors.

If the elevator is on the top floor, which is the maximum floor the elevator can reach is 19 (since it stopped on the 13th floor going up and had the option to go further). Therefore, the building has 19 floors.

Let's break down the elevator's movements:

1. The elevator starts on the 9th floor.
2. It goes down 7 floors, so it is now on the floor number \(9 - 7 = 2\).
3. It then goes up 3 floors, so it is now on the floor number \(2 + 3 = 5\).
4. Finally, it goes up 8 floors, so it is now on the floor number \(5 + 8 = 13\).

Since the elevator is on the top floor, the building must have 14 floors. This is because the elevator was on the 13th floor by the end of the movements, and the floor above the 13th floor would be considered the top floor.

Thus, the building has 14 floors.

To determine the number of floors in the building, we need to follow the elevator's movements step by step:

1. The elevator starts on the 9th floor.
2. It goes down 7 floors: 
   \[
   9 - 7 = 2
   \]
   Now the elevator is on the 2nd floor.
3. It then goes up 3 floors:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
   Now the elevator is on the 5th floor.
4. Finally, it goes up 8 floors:
   \[
   5 + 8 = 13
   \]
   Now the elevator is on the 13th floor.

Since the elevator is on the top floor, we know it must be on the highest floor available. Therefore, the building has 13 floors.
