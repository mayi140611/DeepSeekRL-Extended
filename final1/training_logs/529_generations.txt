To find out how much each person will get, we need to divide the total number of each dessert by the number of people in the family.

First, let's calculate the total number of each dessert that will be distributed:
- Cookies: 42
- Candy: 63
- Brownies: 21

Now, we divide each of these amounts by 7 (since there are 7 people in the family).

Cookies per person: 42 รท 7 = 6
Candy per person: 63 รท 7 = 9
Brownies per person: 21 รท 7 = 3

So, each person will get:
- 6 cookies
- 9 pieces of candy
- 3 brownies

To find out how much each person will get, we need to divide each type of dessert by the number of people. 

The total number of desserts is 42 cookies + 63 pieces of candy + 21 brownies = 126 desserts.

If there are 7 people, each person will get 126 desserts / 7 people = 18 desserts per person.

So, each person will get 18 cookies, 18 pieces of candy, and 18 brownies.

Now, let's calculate how many of each the total is per person.

Cookies: 18
Candy: 18
Brownies: 18

Each person will get 18 cookies, 18 pieces of candy, and 18 brownies.

To make sure that the desserts are distributed equally among 7 people, we need to divide the number of each type of dessert by 7. Let's do that now.

Cookies per person: 42 / 7 = 6
Candies per person: 63 / 7 = 9
Brownies per person: 21 / 7 = 3

Now we calculate each of these:

Cookies per person = 6
Candies per person = 9
Brownies per person = 3

To find out how much each person will get, we need to add up the total number of each dessert and then divide it by the number of people.

Pat has:
- 42 cookies
- 63 pieces of candy
- 21 brownies

Total desserts = 42 + 63 + 21 = 126 desserts

The total number of people is 7.

If we divide the total desserts by the number of people, we can find out how much each person gets.

126 / 7 = 18 desserts per person

So, each person will get 18 cookies, 18 pieces of candy, and 18 brownies.

To determine how much of each dessert each person will get, we need to find the greatest number of people that can evenly distribute the desserts among the 7 people in Pat's family.

1. **Identify the total number of desserts:**
   - Cookies: 42
   - Candy: 63
   - Brownies: 21

2. **Determine the total number of desserts:**
   - Total desserts = 42 (cookies) + 63 (candy) + 21 (brownies)
   - Total desserts = 42 + 63 + 21 = 126

3. **Calculate the number of desserts per person:**
   - Each person gets 126 desserts / 7 people = 18 desserts per person

4. **Verify the distribution:**
   - Cookies: 42 / 7 = 6 cookies per person
   - Candy: 63 / 7 = 9 pieces of candy per person
   - Brownies: 21 / 7 = 3 brownies per person

Since 126 desserts evenly divide into 7 parts (distributing them among 7 people), each person will get 18 desserts.
