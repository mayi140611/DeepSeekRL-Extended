First, we need to determine how much money Carrie will have after trading in her Samsung Galaxy for $240. The cost of the iPhone is $800, and she will receive $240 from the trade-in, so she will have:

$800 - $240 = $560

Carrie earns $80 per week babysitting. To find out how many weeks she needs to work to earn $560, we divide $560 by her weekly earnings:

$560 / $80 per week = 7 weeks

Therefore, Carrie needs to work 7 weeks before she can purchase the iPhone.

To determine how many weeks Carrie needs to work before she can purchase the iPhone, we first need to calculate the remaining amount she needs after the trade-in. The iPhone costs $800, and she is getting $240 from trading in her Samsung Galaxy, so the remaining amount she needs is:

\[ 800 - 240 = 560 \]

Next, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to earn $560, given that she earns $80 per week. She can calculate this by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{560}{80} = 7 \]

Therefore, she needs to work 7 weeks to afford the iPhone.

First, we need to find out how much money Carrie will have after trading in her Samsung Galaxy. She is trading in her Samsung Galaxy for $240. The new iPhone costs $800, so we subtract the trade-in value from the total cost of the iPhone. 
800 - 240 = 560

Carrie needs $560 to buy an iPhone. She makes $80 per week babysitting. Next, we need to determine how many weeks it will take her to gather a total of $560. We can do this by dividing the total amount needed by her weekly earnings.
560 / 80 = 7

Carrie needs to work for 7 weeks to be able to buy the new iPhone.

Carrie needs to find out how much more she needs to save after her trade-in. She wants to buy an iPhone that costs $800, and she can trade in her Samsung Galaxy for $240. So she needs to save $800 - $240 = $560.

Since she can earn $80 per week babysitting, she needs to work $560 / $80 = 7 weeks to save enough for the iPhone.

To determine how many weeks Carrie needs to work before she can purchase the iPhone, we first need to calculate the net cost of the new iPhone after accounting for the trade-in value of her Samsung Galaxy.

The cost of the new iPhone is $800. She can trade in her Samsung Galaxy for $240. So, the net cost of the new iPhone is:
\[ 800 - 240 = 560 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many weeks she needs to work to earn $560 at a rate of $80 per week. We do this by dividing the net cost by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{560}{80} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Carrie needs to work 7 weeks to purchase the iPhone.

First, we need to determine how much money Carrie will have after trading in her Samsung Galaxy. If the new iPhone costs $800 and she can trade in her Samsung Galaxy for $240, she will have:

\[ 800 - 240 = 560 \]

This means she will have $560 after the trade-in. Next, we need to see how much more money she needs to buy the iPhone, which is $800, minus the amount she has after the trade-in, $560. So she needs:

\[ 800 - 560 = 240 \]

She earns $80 per week babysitting. Therefore, the number of weeks she needs to work to earn $240 is:

\[ \frac{240}{80} = 3 \]

So, Carrie needs to work for 3 weeks to be able to purchase the iPhone.

To determine how many weeks Carrie needs to work before she can purchase the iPhone, we first need to calculate the remaining amount after trading in her Samsung Galaxy. 

The cost of the iPhone is $800, and she can trade in her Samsung Galaxy for $240. So, the remaining amount she needs to pay is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Cost of iPhone} - \text{Trade-in value} \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 800 - 240 = 560 \]

Next, we need to find out how many weeks Carrie needs to work to earn $560, given that she makes $80 per week babysitting. We can calculate the number of weeks by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Weekly earnings}} \]
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{560}{80} = 7 \]

Therefore, Carrie needs to work for 7 weeks to have the money to purchase the iPhone.
