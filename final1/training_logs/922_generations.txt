First, we need to calculate the total cost of towels without the discount. 

For the guest bathroom, since each set costs $40.00 and she needs 2 sets, the total cost is \(2 \times 40.00 = $80.00\).

For the master bathroom, each set costs $50.00 and she needs 4 sets, so the total cost is \(4 \times 50.00 = $200.00\).

The total cost of all towels before the discount is \(80.00 + 200.00 = $280.00\).

Since the store is offering a 20% discount, we can calculate the discount amount by finding 20% of the total cost: \(280.00 \times 0.20 = $56.00\).

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the total amount Bailey will spend: \(280.00 - 56.00 = $224.00\).

So the total amount Bailey will spend on towel sets is $224.00.

To find out how much Bailey will spend on towel sets, we need to first calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the discount.

1. **Calculate the total cost for the guest bathroom:**
   - Each set costs $40.00
   - Bailey needs 2 sets
   - Total cost for guest bathroom = 2 * $40.00 = $80.00

2. **Calculate the total cost for the master bathroom:**
   - Each set costs $50.00
   - Bailey needs 4 sets
   - Total cost for master bathroom = 4 * $50.00 = $200.00

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Total cost = Guest bathroom cost + Master bathroom cost
   - Total cost = $80.00 + $200.00 = $280.00

4. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - The discount is 20% of the total cost
   - Discount amount = 0.20 * $280.00 = $56.00
   - Total cost after discount = Total cost - Discount amount
   - Total cost after discount = $280.00 - $56.00 = $224.00

Therefore, Bailey will spend $224.00 on towel sets.

First, let's calculate the total cost for each type of towel set before the discount:

- For the guest bathroom: \(2 \text{ sets} \times \$40.00 \text{ per set} = \$80.00\)
- For the master bathroom: \(4 \text{ sets} \times \$50.00 \text{ per set} = \$200.00\)

Next, we'll apply the 20% discount to each type of towel set:

- Guest bathroom discount: \(20\% \text{ of } \$80.00 = 0.20 \times \$80.00 = \$16.00\). So, the discounted price is: \$80.00 - \$16.00 = \$64.00
- Master bathroom discount: \(20\% \text{ of } \$200.00 = 0.20 \times \$200.00 = \$40.00\). So, the discounted price is: \$200.00 - \$40.00 = \$160.00

Now, we'll add the discounted prices together:

\[ \$64.00 + \$160.00 = \$224.00\]

Therefore, Bailey will spend a total of \$224.00 on towel sets after the discount.

To calculate how much Bailey will spend on towel sets after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of towel sets without the discount.
2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount spent.

Let's break this down:

1. Cost of guest bathroom towels: \(2 \times \$40.00 = \$80.00\)
2. Cost of master bathroom towels: \(4 \times \$50.00 = \$200.00\)
3. Total cost without discount: \(\$80.00 + \$200.00 = \$280.00\)

Now we apply the 20% discount:

4. Discount amount: \(20\% \times \$280.00 = \$56.00\)

5. Final amount after applying the discount: \(\$280.00 - \$56.00 = \$224.00\)

Therefore, Bailey will spend \$224.00 on towel sets after the discount.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the towels for the guest bathroom and the master bathroom before the discount.

The cost for the guest bathroom = 2 sets * $40.00/set = $80.00
The cost for the master bathroom = 4 sets * $50.00/set = $200.00

Now, we add these two amounts to get the total cost before the discount: 
$80.00 + $200.00 = $280.00

Next, we calculate the discount. The store is offering a 20% discount. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $280.00:
20% of $280.00 = 0.20 * $280.00 = $56.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Bailey will spend:
$280.00 - $56.00 = $224.00

Therefore, Bailey will spend $224.00 on towel sets.

For the guest bathroom, Bailey needs 2 sets at $40.00 each, so the cost is:

For the master bathroom, she needs 4 sets at $50.00 each, so the cost is:
\[ 4 \times \$50.00 = \$200.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ \$80.00 + \$200.00 = \$280.00 \]

The store is offering a 20% discount on towels. To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20):
\[ \$280.00 \times 0.20 = \$56.00 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Bailey will spend:

To calculate the total cost of the towel sets, we first need to multiply the number of sets by the price of each set:

- For the guest bathroom: 2 sets * $40.00/set = $80.00
- For the master bathroom: 4 sets * $50.00/set = $200.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $80.00 + $200.00 = $280.00

Now, we apply the 20% discount:
Discounted total = Total cost - (0.20 * Total cost) = $280.00 - (0.20 * $280.00) = $280.00 - $56.00 = $224.00

Therefore, after applying the discount, Bailey will spend:

$224.00

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the towel sets before the discount. For the guest bathroom, it is 2 sets at $40 each, so the total cost for the guest bathroom is 2 * $40 = $80. For the master bathroom, it is 4 sets at $50 each, so the total cost for the master bathroom is 4 * $50 = $200. Therefore, the total cost for all the towel sets before the discount is $80 + $200 = $280.

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. Since the store is offering a 20% discount, Bailey will be paying for 80% of the original total cost. So, the discount amount is 80% of $280, which is $280 * 80% = $280 * 0.8 = $224.

Now, to find out how much Bailey will spend after the discount, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original total cost: $280 - $224 = $56.

Therefore, Bailey will spend $56 on towel sets with the discount.

To calculate the total cost of the towel sets, we need to first determine the cost per set and the total cost before the discount. 

For guest bathrooms, 2 sets at $40.00 each equals a total of 2 * $40.00 = $80.00.

For master bathrooms, 4 sets at $50.00 each equals a total of 4 * $50.00 = $200.00.

So, the total cost before the discount would be $80.00 + $200.00 = $280.00.

Since the store is offering a 20% discount, this means Bailey will pay 100% - 20% = 80% of the total cost. 

So, Bailey will need to pay 80% of $280.00 which is 0.80 * $280.00 = $224.00.

Therefore, Bailey will spend $224.00 on towel sets.

To determine how much Bailey will spend on towel sets after the discount and without considering the taxes, we will calculate the cost of each set for both bathrooms first and then apply the discount.

**Cost of guest bathroom sets:**
- Number of sets needed: 2
- Price per set: $40.00
- Total cost for guest bathroom sets: \(2 \times 40 = \$80.00\)

**Cost of master bathroom sets:**
- Number of sets needed: 4
- Price per set: $50.00
- Total cost for master bathroom sets: \(4 \times 50 = \$200.00\)

**Total cost before discount:**
- Total cost for guest bathroom sets: $80.00
- Total cost for master bathroom sets: $200.00
- Total cost before discount: \(80 + 200 = \$280.00\)

**Applying the 20% discount:**
- Discount rate: 20%
- Discount amount: \(0.20 \times 280 = \$56.00\)
- Total cost after discount: \(280 - 56 = \$224.00\)

Therefore, Bailey will spend $224.00 on towel sets, considering the discount.

To determine how much Bailey will spend on towel sets, we first need to calculate the total cost without the discount, then apply the 20% discount. Here are the steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for the guest bathroom:
   - 2 sets of towels at $40.00 each
   - Total for guest bathroom = 2 * $40.00 = $80.00

2. Calculate the total cost for the master bathroom:
   - 4 sets of towels at $50.00 each
   - Total for master bathroom = 4 * $50.00 = $200.00

3. Add the costs from the guest and master bathrooms:
   - Total cost without discount = $80.00 + $200.00 = $280.00

4. Apply the 20% discount:
   - Discount amount = 20% of $280.00 = 0.20 * $280.00 = $56.00

5. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   - Total cost with discount = $280.00 - $56.00 = $224.00

Therefore, Bailey will spend $224.00 on towel sets.
