To find out how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's calculate the number of pages Joy can read in one hour.
   - Joy reads 8 pages in 20 minutes.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, in one hour, she can read \( \frac{60}{20} \times 8 = 3 \times 8 = 24 \) pages.

2. Now, if we want to find out how many hours it will take her to read 120 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages she can read in an hour:
   - \( 120 \div 24 = 5 \).

Therefore, it will take her 5 hours to read 120 pages.

To determine how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Joy's reading rate in pages per minute:**
   Joy reads 8 pages in 20 minutes. Therefore, her reading rate is:
   \[
   \text{Reading rate} = \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \text{ pages per minute}
   \]

2. **Determine the total time required to read 120 pages:**
   If Joy reads at a rate of 0.4 pages per minute, to read 120 pages, she will need:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{120 \text{ pages}}{0.4 \text{ pages per minute}} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 300 minutes to hours by:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages.

To solve this problem, we can start by finding out how many pages Joy can read per minute, and then use that information to determine how many minutes it will take her to read 120 pages. Finally, we can convert the total minutes into hours.

1. First, we calculate the reading rate. Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes, so her reading rate is \( \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \).

\( \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \text{ pages per minute} \)

2. Now we can find out how many minutes it takes for Joy to read 120 pages at this rate:

\( 120 \text{ pages} \div 0.4 \text{ pages per minute} = 300 \text{ minutes} \)

3. Finally, we convert the minutes into hours:

\( 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \)

So, Joy will take 5 hours to read 120 pages of the book.

To determine how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we first need to figure out her reading rate in pages per hour. We know that she can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. 

First, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[20 \text{ minutes} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours}\]

Joy reads 8 pages in \(\frac{1}{3}\) hours, so her reading rate is:
\[ \text{Pages per hour} = \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{\frac{1}{3} \text{ hours}} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ pages per hour} \]

Now, to find out how many hours it will take her to read 120 pages at this rate, we divide the total number of pages by her reading rate:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ pages}}{24 \text{ pages per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take her 5 hours to read 120 pages.

To determine how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we first need to find her reading rate in pages per minute and then use that rate to calculate the total time needed to read 120 pages.

Given that Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes, we can calculate her reading rate as follows:

\[ \text{Reading Rate} = \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ page}}{2.5 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes it will take her to read 120 pages, we multiply her reading rate by 120:

\[ \text{Minutes for 120 pages} = 120 \text{ pages} \times 2.5 \text{ minutes per page} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Since we need to convert this time into hours, we divide the total minutes by 60 (as there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Hours for 120 pages} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages.

To find out how long it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we first need to determine her reading rate in pages per minute, and then use that to find out how long it would take her to read 120 pages.

1. First, we know that Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. So, her reading rate is 8 pages per 20 minutes. We can simplify this rate as follows:
   \[
   \text{Reading rate} = \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{5 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

2. Now, to find out how long it will take her to read 120 pages at this rate, we divide 120 pages by her reading rate of \(\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{5 \text{ minutes}}\):
   \[
   \text{Time to read 120 pages} = \frac{120 \text{ pages}}{\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{5 \text{ minutes}}} = 120 \text{ pages} \times \frac{5 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ pages}} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we convert 300 minutes into hours:
   \[
   \text{Time in hours} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages.

To find out how long it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we first need to determine her reading rate in pages per minute. 

Joy reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, so her reading rate is:
\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, to find out how long it will take her to read 120 pages, we multiply the number of pages she needs to read by her reading rate in pages per minute:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = 120 \text{ pages} \times 0.4 \text{ pages per minute} \]

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, to convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{48 \text{ minutes}}{60} \]

\[ \text{Time in hours} = 0.8 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Joy 0.8 hours to read 120 pages.

To determine how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Joy's reading rate in pages per minute.
   Joy reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, so her rate is \( \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \).

2. Simplify the reading rate.
   \( \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{8 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{5 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. Determine how many minutes it will take her to read 120 pages.
   To find the number of minutes, we set up the equation:
   \( \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = \text{Total Pages} \).
   \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{5 \text{ minutes}} \times \text{Time} = 120 \text{ pages} \).

4. Solve for the time.
   \( \text{Time} = \frac{120 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

5. Convert the time from minutes to hours.
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
   \( \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

Therefore, it will take Joy 1 hour to read 120 pages.

To determine how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pages Joy reads per minute. Since she can read 8 pages in 20 minutes, we can calculate her reading speed as:

   \[
   \text{Total time (minutes)} = \frac{120 \text{ pages}}{0.4 \text{ pages per minute}} = 300 \text{ minutes}
