To find out how many apples Suraya picked, we first need to determine how many apples Caleb picked. 

Kayla picked 20 apples, and Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla, so Caleb picked \(20 - 5 = 15\) apples.

Now, Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb. So, Suraya picked \(15 + 12 = 27\) apples.

To find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we subtract Kayla's apples from Suraya's apples: \(27 - 20 = 7\).

So, Suraya picked 7 more apples than Kayla.

To find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we'll follow these steps:

1. Find out how many apples Caleb picked:
   - Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla.
   - Kayla picked 20 apples.
   - So, Caleb picked \(20 - 5 = 15\) apples.

2. Find out how many apples Suraya picked:
   - Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb.
   - Caleb picked 15 apples.
   - So, Suraya picked \(15 + 12 = 27\) apples.

3. Calculate how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla:
   - Kayla picked 20 apples.
   - Suraya picked 27 apples.
   - The difference is \(27 - 20 = 7\) apples.

To find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we first need to find out how many apples Caleb picked. Since Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla and Kayla picked 20 apples, Caleb picked \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) apples.

Now, Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb. So, Suraya picked \( 15 + 12 = 27 \) apples.

To find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we subtract the number of apples Kayla picked from the number of apples Suraya picked. So, Suraya picked \( 27 - 20 = 7 \) more apples than Kayla.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Kayla picked 20 apples.
2. Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla, so Caleb picked \(20 - 5 = 15\) apples.
3. Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb, so Suraya picked \(15 + 12 = 27\) apples.

Now, we need to find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla. 

To do this, we subtract the number of apples Kayla picked from the number Suraya picked:
\[ 27 - 20 = 7 \]

Therefore, Suraya picked 7 more apples than Kayla.

To find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we need to first determine how many apples Caleb picked. Since Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla, and Kayla picked 20 apples, we can calculate Caleb's apples as follows:

\( \text{Caleb's apples} = \text{Kayla's apples} - 5 \)
\( \text{Caleb's apples} = 20 - 5 \)
\( \text{Caleb's apples} = 15 \)

Now that we know Caleb picked 15 apples, we can find out how many apples Suraya picked. Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb, so:

\( \text{Suraya's apples} = \text{Caleb's apples} + 12 \)
\( \text{Suraya's apples} = 15 + 12 \)
\( \text{Suraya's apples} = 27 \)

Now that we know Suraya picked 27 apples, we can find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla:

\( \text{Difference} = \text{Suraya's apples} - \text{Kayla's apples} \)
\( \text{Difference} = 27 - 20 \)
\( \text{Difference} = 7 \)

Therefore, Suraya picked 7 more apples than Kayla.

Let's start by finding out how many apples Caleb picked. Since Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla, and Kayla picked 20 apples, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Caleb's apples} = \text{Kayla's apples} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Caleb's apples} = 20 - 5 \]
\[ \text{Caleb's apples} = 15 \]

Now, Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb, so we can find out how many apples Suraya picked:

\[ \text{Suraya's apples} = \text{Caleb's apples} + 12 \]
\[ \text{Suraya's apples} = 15 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Suraya's apples} = 27 \]

To find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we subtract Kayla's apples from Suraya's apples:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Suraya's apples} - \text{Kayla's apples} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 27 - 20 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 7 \]

So, Suraya picked 7 more apples than Kayla.

To find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we need to first determine how many apples Caleb picked and then how many Suraya picked.

Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla. Since Kayla picked 20 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Caleb picked as follows:
\[ \text{Caleb's apples} = \text{Kayla's apples} - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb. Since Caleb picked 15 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Suraya picked as follows:
\[ \text{Suraya's apples} = \text{Caleb's apples} + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Now, to find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we calculate the difference between Suraya's and Kayla's apples:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Suraya's apples} - \text{Kayla's apples} = 27 - 20 = 7 \]

Therefore, Suraya picked 7 more apples than Kayla.

To determine how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we start by calculating the number of apples Caleb picked. Since Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla, we subtract 5 from the number of apples Kayla picked:

\[ \text{Number of apples Caleb picked} = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the number of apples Suraya picked. Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb, so we add 12 to the number of apples Caleb picked:

\[ \text{Number of apples Suraya picked} = 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Kayla picked from the number of apples Suraya picked:
