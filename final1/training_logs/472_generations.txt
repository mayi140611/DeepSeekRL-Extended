#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the amount of money owned by Ali as \( A \) and the amount owned by James as \( J \).

According to the information given:
1. James and Ali together own $250, so we can write:
\[ A + J = 250 \]

2. James owns $40 more than Ali, so we can write:
\[ J = A + 40 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( A \) and \( J \):
\[ A + (A + 40) = 250 \]
\[ 2A + 40 = 250 \]
\[ 2A = 210 \]
\[ A = 105 \]

Now that we have the value of Ali's investment, we can find James's investment using the second equation:
\[ J = A + 40 \]
\[ J = 105 + 40 \]
\[ J = 145 \]

Therefore, James owns $145.

Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as \( A \) and the amount owned by James as \( J \). According to the problem, we have:

1. The total amount owned by James and Ali is $250:
\[ J + A = 250 \]

2. James owns $40 more than Ali:
\[ J = A + 40 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( A \):

\[ (A + 40) + A = 250 \]
\[ 2A + 40 = 250 \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 2A = 250 - 40 \]
\[ 2A = 210 \]
\[ A = 105 \]

Now that we know Ali owns $105, we can find out how much James owns by using the second equation:

\[ J = A + 40 \]
\[ J = 105 + 40 \]
\[ J = 145 \]

Therefore, the amount owned by James is $145.

Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as \( A \) and the amount owned by James as \( J \).

Given:
1. \( J + A = 250 \)
2. \( J = A + 40 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( A \):
\[ (A + 40) + A = 250 \]
\[ 2A + 40 = 250 \]
\[ 2A = 210 \]
\[ A = 105 \]

Now that we know \( A \), we can find \( J \):
\[ J = A + 40 \]
\[ J = 105 + 40 \]
\[ J = 145 \]

Therefore, the amount owned by James is \( \$145 \).

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as A and the amount owned by James as J. According to the problem, we have two equations:

1) J + A = 250 (since together they own $250)
2) J = A + 40 (since James owns $40 more than Ali)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to find the individual amounts:

A + (A + 40) = 250
2A + 40 = 250
2A = 210
A = 105

Now that we know Ali owns $105, we can calculate James' amount:

J = A + 40
J = 105 + 40
J = 145

So, James owns $145.

Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as \( A \) and the amount owned by James as \( J \).

According to the information given:
1. \( J + A = 250 \)
2. \( J = A + 40 \)

We can substitute the value of \( J \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\( (A + 40) + A = 250 \)

Now, solve for \( A \):
\( 2A + 40 = 250 \)
\( 2A = 250 - 40 \)
\( 2A = 210 \)
\( A = \frac{210}{2} \)
\( A = 105 \)

Now that we know Ali owns $105, we can find out how much James owns by adding $40 to Ali's amount:
\( J = 105 + 40 \)
\( J = 145 \)

Therefore, the amount owned by James is $145.

system
Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as \( x \). According to the information, James owns $40 more than Ali, so we can express the amount owned by James as \( x + 40 \).

The total amount they own together is $250, which gives us the equation:
\[ x + (x + 40) = 250 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 40 = 250 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 105 \]

Therefore, Ali owns $105, and James owns $40 more than Ali, which is:
\[ 105 + 40 = 145 \]

So, James owns $145.

Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as \( A \) and the amount owned by James as \( J \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Together they own $250. So, \( J + A = 250 \).
2. James owns $40 more than Ali. This gives us \( J = A + 40 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( A \):

\[ (A + 40) + A = 250 \]

Combining like terms gives:

\[ 2A + 40 = 250 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides:

\[ 2A = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ A = 105 \]

So Ali owns $105. Now, we can find out how much James owns by substituting the value of \( A \) back into the second equation:

\[ J = A + 40 \]
\[ J = 105 + 40 \]
\[ J = 145 \]

James owns $145. To verify, we can check that the sum of their amounts is indeed $250:

\[ J + A = 145 + 105 = 250 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, James owns $145.

Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as \( A \). Since James owns $40 more than Ali, the amount owned by James is \( A + 40 \). According to the problem, together they own $250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (A + 40) = 250 \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ 2A + 40 = 250 \]

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2A = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ A = 105 \]

So, Ali owns $105. Since James owns $40 more than Ali, the amount owned by James is:

\[ 105 + 40 = 145 \]

Thus, James owns $145.

Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as \( A \) and the amount owned by James as \( J \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Together James and Ali own $250, which can be written as:
   \[
   J + A = 250
   \]

2. James owns $40 more than Ali, which can be written as:
   \[
   J = A + 40
   \]

To find the amounts owned by James and Ali, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. This gives us:
\[
(A + 40) + A = 250
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
2A + 40 = 250
\]

Next, we need to isolate \( A \). We do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[
2A = 210
\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( A \):
\[
A = 105
\]

Now that we know Ali owns $105, we can find out how much James owns by using the equation \( J = A + 40 \):
\[
J = 105 + 40 = 145
\]

So, James owns $145.
