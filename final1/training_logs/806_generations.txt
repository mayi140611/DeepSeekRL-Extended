#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
<reasoning>
Tyler starts with 21 CDs. He gives away a third of his CDs, which is 21 / 3 = 7 CDs. So, he gives away 7 CDs and is left with 21 - 7 = 14 CDs.

Tyler then buys 8 brand new CDs, so he adds 8 CDs to the 14 he already has. Therefore, he now has 14 + 8 = 22 CDs.

Tyler starts with 21 CDs. He gives away one third of his CDs to his friend. So he gives away \( \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7 \) CDs. After giving away 7 CDs, Tyler has \( 21 - 7 = 14 \) CDs left. Then he buys 8 new CDs. So, he adds 8 to his remaining 14 CDs. Therefore, Tyler now has \( 14 + 8 = 22 \) CDs.

First, we need to determine how many CDs Tyler gives away. If he has 21 CDs and gives away a third, we calculate that as \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) CDs. So, after giving away 7 CDs, Tyler has \( 21 - 7 = 14 \) CDs left.

Next, Tyler goes to the music store and buys 8 new CDs. So, we add these 8 new CDs to the 14 CDs he has left: \( 14 + 8 = 22 \).

Therefore, Tyler now has 22 CDs.

First, we need to determine how many CDs Tyler gives away to his friend. Since he has 21 CDs and he gives away a third of them, we calculate:
\[ \text{CDs given away} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]
After giving away 7 CDs, Tyler will have:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]
Now, Tyler buys 8 new CDs, so the total number of CDs Tyler has now is:
\[ 14 + 8 = 22 \]

To determine how many CDs Tyler has now, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many CDs Tyler gives away to his friend:
   - Tyler has 21 CDs and gives away a third of them.
   - One third of 21 is \(21 \div 3 = 7\) CDs.

2. Calculate how many CDs Tyler has left after giving some away:
   - After giving away 7 CDs, Tyler has \(21 - 7 = 14\) CDs left.

3. Calculate how many CDs Tyler has after buying new ones:
   - Tyler buys 8 new CDs.
   - Adding these to the 14 CDs he had left gives \(14 + 8 = 22\) CDs.

First, we need to determine how many CDs Tyler gives away to his friend. This is 1/3 of his initial 21 CDs:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7
\]

Thus, Tyler gives away 7 CDs. After giving away these CDs, Tyler is left with:

\[
21 - 7 = 14
\]

Next, Tyler buys 8 new CDs. Adding these new CDs to what he had left:

\[
14 + 8 = 22
\]

So, in total, Tyler now has 22 CDs.
