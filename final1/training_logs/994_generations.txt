<reasoning>
1. Let's calculate the total amount raised for the field trip by both Miss Grayson and her students. First, she raised $50 and each of the 20 students contributed $5. So, the total contribution from students is \(20 \times 5 = 100\).
2. Therefore, the total amount raised for the field trip is \(50 + 100 = 150\).
3. The total cost of the field trip for all students is calculated as \(20 \times 7 = 140\).
4. So, the amount left in Miss Grayson's class fund after paying the field trip costs is \(150 - 140 = 10\).

First, calculate the total contribution from the students. Since there are 20 students each contributing $5, the total contribution from the students is:
\[ 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, add the $50 already raised by the class:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 20 students, with each student's trip costing $7:
\[ 20 \times 7 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, subtract the total cost of the trip from the total amount raised:
\[ 150 - 140 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount left in Miss Grayson's class fund is $10.

To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the initial amount raised and the total amount invested by the students.

First, we calculate the total contribution from the students. Each student contributed $5, and there are 20 students in the class. So, the total contribution from the students is \(20 \times 5 = 100\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the trip. Each student's trip costs $7, and there are 20 students. So, the total cost of the trip is \(20 \times 7 = 140\) dollars.

Now we can find out the remaining amount in Miss Grayson's class fund. The total amount raised initially is $50. So, the remaining amount after paying for the trip is \(100 - 140 = -40\). This negative value indicates that the class ran out of funds and there is a shortfall of $40.

To determine how much is left in Miss Grayson's class fund, we need to calculate the total amount raised and subtract the cost of the field trip for all the students.

First, we calculate the total contributions from the students:
Each student contributed $5, and there are 20 students.
So, the total contributions from the students = $5/student * 20 students = $100.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the field trip for all students:
There are 20 students, and each trip costs $7 per student.
So, the total cost of the field trip = $7/student * 20 students = $140.

Now, we add the initial amount raised ($50) to the total contributions from the students ($100):
Total amount raised = Initial amount raised + Total contributions from students = $50 + $100 = $150.

We subtract the total cost of the field trip from the total amount raised:
Total amount raised - Total cost of the field trip = $150 - $140 = $10.

Therefore, $10 is left in Miss Grayson's class fund after all the field trip costs were paid.

To find out how much is left in Miss Grayson's class fund after all the field trip costs are paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount raised by the students individually.
2. Calculate the total amount raised by the class.
3. Calculate the total cost of the trip for all the students.
4. Subtract the total cost of the trip from the total amount raised to find out how much is left in the class fund.

Let's break this down:

1. The amount raised by each student individually is 50 * 5 = $250.
2. The total amount raised by the class is 20 * 250 = $5000.
3. The total cost of the trip for all the students is 20 * 7 = $140.
4. After all the trip costs are paid, the amount left in the class fund is $5000 - $140 = $4860.

Therefore, there is $4860 left in Miss Grayson's class fund.

To determine how much is left in Miss Grayson's class fund after paying for the field trip, we need to calculate the total amount raised and then subtract the total cost of the trip.

First, calculate the total amount contributed by the students. Each student contributed $5, and there are 20 students:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/student} \times 20 \text{ students} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the trip. The cost is $7 per student for 20 students:
\[ 7 \text{ dollars/student} \times 20 \text{ students} = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, determine the total amount of money available after adding the initial $50 contribution:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars (initial contribution)} + 100 \text{ dollars (student contributions)} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, subtract the total cost of the trip from the total amount of money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars (total amount)} - 140 \text{ dollars (trip cost)} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount left in Miss Grayson's class fund is $10.

To determine how much is left in Miss Grayson's class fund after paying for the field trip costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount collected from contributions.
2. Calculate the total cost of the field trip.
3. Subtract the total cost of the field trip from the total amount collected.

First, we calculate the total amount collected from contributions:
Each student contributed $5, and there are 20 students, so the total amount collected from contributions is \(20 \times 5 = \$100\).

Next, we calculate the total cost of the field trip:
The trip costs $7 per student, and there are 20 students, so the total cost of the field trip is \(20 \times 7 = \$140\).

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the field trip from the total amount collected:
The total amount collected is $100, and the total cost of the field trip is $140, so the remaining amount in the class fund is \(100 - 140 = -40\).

Since the remaining amount is negative, this means there is a deficit and still needs to be paid from the class fund.

The total amount raised by Miss Grayson's class from the initial $50 and contributions from each student can be calculated as follows:
- Initial amount raised: $50
- Contribution per student: $5
- Number of students: 20

The total contribution from the students is $5 * 20. Adding this to the initial $50, we get the total amount raised so far.

The cost of the trip for each student is $7. For 20 students, the total cost is $7 * 20.

Subtract the total cost of the trip from the total amount raised to find out how much is left in the class fund.

First, we calculate the total amount of money collected by Miss Grayson's class. This includes the $50 they initially raised and the $5 contribution from each of the 20 students. So the total amount raised is $50 + ($5 x 20) = $50 + $100 = $150.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the trip for all 20 students. This is $7 per student, so the total cost for 20 students is $7 x 20 = $140.

To know how much is left, we can first determine the total amount raised. This includes the initial amount ($50), and the total from each student. 

Each student contributed $5, and there are 20 students:

\[ 50 + (5 \times 20) = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

So, the total amount raised is $150.

Next, we calculate the cost for all students when each trip costs $7:

\[ 7 \times 20 = 140 \]

Now, to find the remainder, we subtract the total cost of the trip from the total amount raised:

\[ 150 - 140 = 10 \]

Therefore, $10 is left in Miss Grayson's class fund.

The total amount raised by the class for the field trip is the sum of the $50 they had initially and the $5 each student contributed. Since there are 20 students, the total contribution from the students is 20 * $5 = $100.

The total cost of the trip for all the students is $7 per student, so for 20 students, it would be 20 * $7 = $140.

Now we can determine the total amount they raised and the total cost of the field trip. The total amount raised is $50 (initial) + $100 (student contributions) = $150. The total cost of the field trip is $140. Therefore, to find out how much is left in Miss Grayson's class fund, we subtract the total cost from the total amount raised: $150 - $140 = $10.

Therefore, the fund left in Miss Grayson's class is $10.
