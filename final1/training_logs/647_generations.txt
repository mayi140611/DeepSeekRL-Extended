To determine how much money Olivia made this week, we need to calculate her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings for each day:

- **Monday**: Olivia worked 4 hours.
  \[
  \text{Earnings on Monday} = 4 \text{ hours} \times \$9/\text{hour} = \$36
  \]

- **Wednesday**: Olivia worked 3 hours.
  \[
  \text{Earnings on Wednesday} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$9/\text{hour} = \$27
  \]

- **Friday**: Olivia worked 6 hours.
  \[
  \text{Earnings on Friday} = 6 \text{ hours} \times \$9/\text{hour} = \$54
  \]

Next, we sum up her earnings for the week:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \$36 + \$27 + \$54
\]

Adding these amounts:
\[
\$36 + \$27 = \$63
\]
\[
\$63 + \$54 = \$117
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Olivia made this week is:
\[
\$117
\]
