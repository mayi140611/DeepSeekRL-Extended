#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine how much money Tommy needs to save, we first calculate the total cost of the 8 books. Each book costs $5, so the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Tommy already has $13. To find out how much more he needs to save, we subtract the amount he already has from the total cost:

\[ 40 - 13 = 27 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Tommy needs to save up \(\boxed{27}\) dollars more.

To determine how much money Tommy needs to save up, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 8 books.
2. Subtract the amount Tommy already has from the total cost to find out how much more he needs.

Step 1: The cost of each book is $5. Therefore, the cost of 8 books is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount Tommy already has ($13) from the total cost ($40):
\[ 40 - 13 = 27 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tommy needs to save up $27.
