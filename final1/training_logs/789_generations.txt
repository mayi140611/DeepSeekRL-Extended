<reasoning>
Let's denote the length of the rectangle as \( L \).

We know that the width of the rectangle is 4 inches, so \( L = 4 \) inches.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ P = 2L + 2W \]

Given that the perimeter \( P \) is 30 inches, we can substitute the known values into the formula to find \( L \):
\[ 30 = 2(4) + 2(4) \]
\[ 30 = 8 + 8 \]
\[ 30 = 16 \]

This equation is incorrect, which indicates there might be a typo or misunderstanding in the problem statement. However, since we are given the width and the perimeter, we can proceed with the correct values for \( L \) and \( W \).

The correct perimeter formula should be:
\[ P = 2L + 2W \]

Given that \( W = 4 \) and \( P = 30 \), we can solve for \( L \) correctly:
\[ 30 = 2L + 2(4) \]
\[ 30 = 2L + 8 \]
\[ 22 = 2L \]
\[ L = 11 \]

So, the length of the rectangle is 11 inches.

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ A = L \times W \]
\[ A = 11 \times 4 \]
\[ A = 44 \]

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 44 square inches.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as \( L \).

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the width of the rectangle is 4 inches and the perimeter is 30 inches, we can write:
\[ 30 = 2 \times (L + 4) \]

We can solve for \( L \):
\[ 15 = L + 4 \]
\[ L = 11 \] inches

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the area \( A \) of the rectangle using the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ A = 11 \times 4 \]
\[ A = 44 \] square inches

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 44 square inches.

We can calculate the length of the rectangle using the perimeter formula: \(P = 2L + 2W\). Given that the width \(W = 4\) inches and the perimeter \(P = 30\) inches, we can substitute the values into the formula to find the length \(L\).

\(30 = 2L + 2(4)\)

\(30 = 2L + 8\)

\(22 = 2L\)

\(L = 11\) inches

Now that we have the length, we can calculate the area \(A\) of the rectangle using the formula \(A = L \times W\).

\(A = 11 \times 4 = 44\) square inches.

To find the area of the rectangle, we first need to determine its length. We know that the rectangle's width is 4 inches and its perimeter is 30 inches. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]
Substituting the given perimeter and width into the formula, we have:
\[
30 = 2 \times (\text{length} + 4)
\]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
30 = 2 \times \text{length} + 8
\]
Subtracting 8 from both sides, we obtain:
\[
22 = 2 \times \text{length}
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we find the length:
\[
\text{length} = 11 \text{ inches}
\]
Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the area \( A \) of the rectangle using the formula:
\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
A = 11 \times 4 = 44 \text{ square inches}
\]

To find the area of the rectangle, we first need to determine its length. Given that the width is 4 inches and the perimeter is 30 inches, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is \( P = 2 \times (L + W) \), where \( L \) is the length and \( W \) is the width. Here, \( W = 4 \) inches.

Substituting the given values:
\[ 30 = 2 \times (L + 4) \]

We solve for \( L \):
\[ 15 = L + 4 \]
\[ L = 11 \] inches.

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the area \( A \) of the rectangle using the formula \( A = L \times W \):
\[ A = 11 \times 4 = 44 \] square inches.

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 44 square inches.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as \( L \) and the width as \( W \). We know from the problem that the width \( W \) is 4 inches and the perimeter is 30 inches. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[ 2L + 2W = 30 \]
Substituting \( W = 4 \) into the formula, we get:
\[ 2L + 2(4) = 30 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 30 \]
\[ 2L = 30 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 22 \]
\[ L = 11 \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = L \times W \]
\[ \text{Area} = 11 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 44 \]

So, the area of the rectangle is 44 square inches.

To find the area of the rectangle, we first need to determine its length. We know the width is 4 inches and the perimeter is 30 inches. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find the length:
\[ \text{Length} = 15 - 4 = 11 \text{ inches} \]

Now that we know the length is 11 inches and the width is 4 inches, we can calculate the area of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 11 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} = 44 \text{ square inches} \]

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as \( l \) and the width as \( w \). We are given that the width \( w \) is 4 inches and the perimeter of the rectangle is 30 inches. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( 2w + 2l \). Given these conditions, we can write the equation for the perimeter as follows:

\[ 24 + 2l = 30 \]

To find the length \( l \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2l = 6 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ l = 3 \]

Now we know the length of the rectangle is 3 inches. To find the area of the rectangle, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is \( w \times l \):

\[ \text{Area} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 12 square inches.

To find the area of the rectangle, first, we need to determine the length of the rectangle. We know the width is 4 inches and the perimeter of the rectangle is 30 inches. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Plugging in the values we know:
\[ 30 = 2 \times (\text{Length} + 4) \]

Solving for the Length:
\[ 30 = 2 \times \text{Length} + 8 \]
\[ 30 - 8 = 2 \times \text{Length} \]
\[ 22 = 2 \times \text{Length} \]
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ \text{Length} = 11 \text{ inches} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can calculate the area:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Area} = 11 \times 4 \]

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as \( l \) and the width as \( w \). We are given that \( w = 4 \) inches and the perimeter \( P \) is 30 inches. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[
P = 2l + 2w

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[
30 = 2l + 2(4)
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
30 = 2l + 8
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
22 = 2l
\]

Divide by 2 to find \( l \):

\[
l = 11
\]

Now we have both the length \( l = 11 \) inches and the width \( w = 4 \) inches. To find the area \( A \) of the rectangle, we use the formula:

\[
A = l \times w
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
A = 11 \times 4 = 44

Now that we know the length is 11 inches and the width is 4 inches, we can calculate the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by:
