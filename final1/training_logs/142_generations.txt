To solve this problem, we need to consider the overlap and subtraction of the germs killed by both sanitisers. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Germs Killed by Spray A (50%):** The 50% spray kills germs, but we need to account for the overlap.
2. **Total Germs Killed by Spray B (25%):** The 25% spray also kills some germs, but we need to account for the overlap.

Given that 5% of the germs killed by both sprays are the same, let's determine how much germs are killed by each spray without overlapping.

3. **Germs Only Killed by Spray A:** 
   - Since 5% of the germs killed by Spray A are the same as those killed by Spray B, the remaining 95% of the germs killed by Spray A are unique.

4. **Germs Only Killed by Spray B:**
   - Similarly, 95% of the germs killed by Spray B are unique, since 5% overlap are shared with Spray A.

5. **Total Germs Killed Unique to Each Spray:**
   - Germs only killed by Spray A: 95%.
   - Germs only killed by Spray B: 95%.

6. **Germs Initially:** Let's assume there are 100% germs initially.

7. **Germs Killed After the First Spray:** 
   - After using Spray A (50% on germs), the total germs killed are 95% (95% from unique germs).

8. **Germs Killed After the Second Spray:**
   - This is a bit tricky since there is an overlap. Since 5% of the germs killed by both are the same, this overlap needs to be subtracted from the 25% killed by Spray B.

9. **Germs Killed After Both Sprays:**
   - Germs killed by Spray B are 25% unique and 5% overlapped by the first spray (due to the 5% overlap we're considering).
   - Therefore, 25% * 0.95 = 23.75% unique to B, and 25% * 0.05 = 1.25% overlapped.

10. **Total Germs Killed:**
    - Total unique germs killed = 95% (A) + 23.75% (B unique) + 1.25% (B overlapped by 5% of A).
    - Total unique germs killed = 119.0% (which is already more than 100%, indicating an error in calculation).

To correct this, we need to subtract the overlap correctly and recalculate:
   - Correctly, 95% from A and 23.75% from B unique + 1.25% from B overlapped = 119.0% (incorrect, considering overlaps).
   - Revising: 95% A only, 16.25% unique from B, 5% overlapped.
   - Total: 95% A, 16.25% B only, 5% overlapped = 116% wrong.
   - Correct: 95% A, 16.25% B, none overlapping = 111%.

Therefore, the percentage of germs left after using both sanitizer sprays is:

Answer: 9%.

This is because the 5% of germs killed by both sprays overlap, so we need to subtract this

Let's assume there are 100 germs in the sample.
- The first spray kills 50% of germs, or 50 germs.
- The second spray kills 25% of germs, or 25 germs.
- However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones, so we need to subtract 5 from the total number of dead germs after both sprays.
- 50 germs - 5 germs = 45 germs left after the first spray.
- 25 germs - 5 germs = 20 germs left after the second spray.
- 45 germs + 20 germs = 65 germs.
- Subtracting these 65 germs from the total of 100 germs, we have 35% of germs left.

Let's assume there are 100% of germs initially.

- The first spray kills 50% of germs, leaving 50%.
- The second spray kills 25% of germs, leaving another 75% of the remaining germs (since 5% are the same as before).

When both sprays are used together, we need to remove the germs that are killed by both sprays. Since 5% of the germs killed by both sprays are already counted in the 25% killed by the second spray, we need to subtract these 5% from the 25% of germs left after the first spray.

So, the germs killed by both sprays are 5%, and the germs killed by the second spray but not the first are 20% (25% - 5%).

The total percentage of germs killed by both sprays is 25% (first spray) + 5% (second spray not killed by the first) = 30%.

Therefore, the percentage of germs left is 100% - 30% = 70%.

Let's break this down step by step.

1. The first spray kills 50% of germs, but 5% of the germs killed are the same ones as those killed by the second spray. Hence, the number of unique germs killed by only the first spray is 50% - 5% = 45%.

2. The second spray kills 25% of germs, and 5% of these 25% are unique to it, while the remaining 20% are the same as those killed by the first spray. Therefore, the number of unique germs killed by only the second spray is 25% - 5% = 20%.

3. The total number of unique germs killed by both sprays together is 45% (from the first spray) + 20% (from the second spray) = 65%.

4. Since 5% of the germs are the same ones killed by both sprays, the total percentage of germs actually left after using both sprays together is 100% - 5% = 95%.

Let's denote the total percentage of germs as 100%.

- The first spray kills 50% of germs, but 5% of those are the same as those killed by the second spray.
- The second spray kills 25% of germs, but 5% of those are the same as those killed by the first spray.

When both sprays are used together, we need to account for the germs that are both killed by both sprays, which is 5%.

So, the percentage of germs killed by both sprays is 5%.

Let's solve this by considering the overlap in the germs killed by both sprays. If both sprays kill 25% of the germs each, there is then an overlap killing 5% of the germs that are killed by both sprays.

So, 50% - 5% = 45% of the germs remain after the first spray is used.
After the second spray, the 45% killed by the second spray plus 5% overlap is:
45% + 5% = 50%

Therefore, the germs left after using both sanitizer sprays together is 50% of the original germs.

To determine the total percentage of germs left after using both sanitizer sprays together, we need to consider the overlaps in the germs killed by each spray.

Let's denote:
- \( P_1 \) as the first spray, which kills 50% of the germs.
- \( P_2 \) as the second spray, which kills 25% of the germs.
- \( P_{12} \) as the overlap in the germs killed by both sprays, which is 5% of the total germs.

When spraying with \( P_1 \) alone, 50% of the germs are killed, and the remaining 50% are not affected by \( P_1 \). Some of these 50% are the same as those killed by \( P_2 \), so only 5% of the germs are affected by both sprays.

Now, when spraying with \( P_2 \) alone, 25% of the germs are killed, and the remaining 75% are not affected by \( P_2 \) (since 5% were already affected by \( P_1 \)).

Next, we combine these two scenarios. The 5% of the germs that were affected by both sprays will be killed by \( P_2 \) alone, and thus will contribute to the total 75% (95-5 = 90%) that were not initially killed by either spray.

So, the remaining germs after using both sprays would be:
\[ 100\% - (50\% \times \frac{90}{100} + 25\% \times \frac{5}{100}) = 100\% - (45 + 1.25) = 100\% - 46.25\% = 53.75\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of germs left after using both sanitizer sprays together would be 53.75%.

Let's calculate the combined effect of the two sanitizer sprays.

First, let's denote the germs before any sanitizer spray as \( G \).

- The first spray kills 50% of the germs.
- The second spray kills 25% of the germs.
- The overlap, where both sprays kill the same 5% of germs, needs to be considered.

If both sprays are used on the same germs, they would kill the 5% that overlaps, so after the overlap, 35% of the germs would remain (100% - 5% overlap).

If the sprays are not used on the same germs, they would kill \( 50\% + 25\% - 5\% = 70\% \) of the germs. Since the overlap is 5% and has already been counted twice, we subtract this 5% count again when considering the overlap effect:

So, if the sprays are not used on the same germs, 35% remain after both sanitizer sprays are applied.

If the sprays are applied on the same germs, 35% would remain from the first spray, and then another 35% from the second spray.

Therefore, the percentage of germs left after using both sanitizer sprays together is 35%.

Let's denote the percentage of germs that get killed by each spray:

- Spray A kills 50% of the germs.
- Spray B kills 25% of the germs.

However, 5% of the germs are killed by both sprays. To find the percentage of germs that are killed by both sprays:

5% × 2 = 10%

This means that 10% of the germs get killed by both sprays.

Now, subtract the percentage killed by both sprays from the total percentage of germs:

100% total germs - 10% killed by both sprays = 90%

This means that out of 100% germs, 90% are left after using both sanitizer sprays together.

To find the percentage of germs left after using both sanitizer sprays together, we need to consider the overlapping effect of the germs killed by both sprays.

Let's denote:
- \( p_1 = 50\% \) (the first spray kills 50% of germs)
- \( p_2 = 25\% \) (the second spray kills 25% of germs)
- \( p_{\text{overlap}} = 5\% \) (5% of germs are killed by both sprays)

First, we calculate the total percentage of germs killed if the sprays were used independently:
\[ p_1 + p_2 = 50\% + 25\% = 75\% \]

Next, we need to account for the overlap, where 5% of the germs are killed by both sprays. To find the effective percentage of germs killed by both sprays together, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ \text{Effective Percentage} = p_1 + p_2 - p_{\text{overlap}} \]
\[ \text{Effective Percentage} = 75\% - 5\% = 70\% \]

Now, to find the percentage of germs left, we subtract the effective percentage from 100%:
\[ \text{Percentage of germs left} = 100\% - 70\% = 30\% \]

So, if both sanitizer sprays are used together, 30% of germs would be left.

To find out what percentage of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together, we need to consider the probabilities of killing germs and the overlap between the two sprays.

First, let's analyze the killing probability of each spray:
- Spray A kills 50% of germs.
- Spray B kills 25% of germs.
- Sprays kill 5% of germs that are the same.

The key is to account for the overlap (5% of the germs killed by both sprays). When using both sprays consecutively, the germs killed by Spray A will have a 30% chance of being killed again by Spray B because of the overlap (5% overlap + 25% of spray A = 30%).

Let's calculate the effective percentage of germs killed by each spray considering the overlap:

1. Germs killed by Spray A only:
   (50% - 5%) = 45%

2. Germs killed by Spray B only:
   (25% - 5%) = 20%

3. Germs killed by both sprays:
   5%

Now, subtract the germs killed by both sprays from the effective percentages from the previous steps.

4. Germs killed by Spray A only, but not by Spray B (to avoid double-counting the overlap):
   (45% - 5%) = 40%

5. Germs killed by Spray B only, but not by Spray A (avoiding double-counting the overlap):
   (20% - 5%) = 15%

Next, calculate the total percentage of germs killed by either spray, which is the sum of what was killed by each spray considering the overlap:
   5% (overlapping sprays) + 40% (Spray A only) + 15% (Spray B only) = 60%

Now, find 100% - the percentage of germs killed by either spray (60%) to find the percentage left:
   100% - 60% = 40%

Therefore, 40% of the germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together.
