To find the total number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes, we need to first calculate the number of stripes each person has and then sum them up.

Olga has 3 stripes per shoe. Since each shoe has 3 stripes, she has a total of \(3 \times 2 = 6\) stripes per shoe. Since she has three shoes, the total number of stripes for Olga is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Rick has one less stripe per shoe than Olga, so he has 2 stripes per shoe. Since he has three shoes, the total number of stripes for Rick is \(2 \times 2 = 4\).

Hortense has double the number of stripes on her tennis shoes as does Olga, so she has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) stripes per shoe. Since she has three shoes, the total number of stripes for Hortense is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Adding all the stripes together, the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes is \(12 + 4 + 12 = 28\).

Olga has 3 stripes per shoe, which means she has 3*2 = 6 stripes in total for both her left and right shoes. Rick has one less stripe per shoe than does Olga, so he has 3-1=2 stripes per shoe. Thus, Rick has 2*2 = 4 stripes in total for both his left and right shoes. Hortense has double the number of stripes on her tennis shoes as does Olga, meaning she has 2*3=6 stripes on one pair of shoes, and thus 2*6 = 12 stripes in total for both pairs.
We can sum up the total number of stripes on all their pairs of tennis shoes as follows: 6+4+12=22
Therefore, Hortense, Rick and Olga have a total of 22 stripes.

To find the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes, we start by determining the number of stripes Olga, Rick, and Hortense have.

Olga has three stripes on each of her shoes, so she has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) stripes in total.

Rick has one less stripe per shoe than Olga, so he has \(3 - 1 = 2\) stripes on each of his shoes. Therefore, Rick has \(2 \times 2 = 4\) stripes in total.

Hortense has double the number of stripes on each of her shoes as Olga, so she has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) stripes on each of her shoes. Therefore, Hortense has \(6 \times 2 = 12\) stripes in total.

Next, we add the number of stripes each person has:
\[6 \text{ (Olga)} + 4 \text{ (Rick)} + 12 \text{ (Hortense)} = 22\]

Therefore, the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes is 22.

To find the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes, we will calculate the number of stripes for each person and then sum them up.

First, Olga has 3 stripes on each of her tennis shoes. Since she has two shoes, she has:
\[ 3 \text{ stripes/shoe} \times 2 \text{ shoes} = 6 \text{ stripes} \]

Next, we know that Rick has one less stripe per shoe than Olga. Therefore, Rick has:
\[ 3 \text{ stripes} - 1 = 2 \text{ stripes/shoe} \]
For two shoes, he has:
\[ 2 \text{ stripes/shoe} \times 2 \text{ shoes} = 4 \text{ stripes} \]

Hortense has double the number of stripes on her tennis shoes as Olga. Therefore, Hortense has:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ stripes} = 6 \text{ stripes/shoe} \]
For two shoes, she has:
\[ 6 \text{ stripes/shoe} \times 2 \text{ shoes} = 12 \text{ stripes} \]

Now, we sum the stripes for all three people:
\[ 6 \text{ stripes} (Olga) + 4 \text{ stripes} (Rick) + 12 \text{ stripes} (Hortense) = 22 \text{ stripes} \]

Therefore, the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes is:
\[ 22 \]

To find the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes, we need to calculate the number of stripes each person has and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stripes Olga has. Olga has 3 stripes on each of her two pairs of tennis shoes:
\[ 3 \text{ stripes/shoe} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} \times 2 \text{ pairs} = 3 \times 2 \times 2 = 12 \text{ stripes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of stripes Rick has. Rick has one less stripe per shoe than Olga, so he has 2 stripes on each shoe:
\[ 2 \text{ stripes/shoe} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} \times 2 \text{ pairs} = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \text{ stripes} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of stripes Hortense has. Hortense has double the number of stripes on her tennis shoes as does Olga, so she has:
\[ 2 \times 12 \text{ stripes} = 24 \text{ stripes} \]

Finally, we sum up the number of stripes each person has:
\[ 12 \text{ stripes (Olga)} + 8 \text{ stripes (Rick)} + 24 \text{ stripes (Hortense)} = 44 \text{ stripes} \]

Therefore, the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes is 44.

To find the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes, we need to calculate the number of stripes for each person first.

Olga has three stripes per pair of shoes. Since she has two pairs of shoes, the total number of stripes for Olga is:
3 stripes/pair * 2 pairs = 6 stripes

Rick has one less stripe per shoe than Olga. Since each of Rick's shoes has 3 stripes, he has:
(3 - 1) stripes/primer * 2 pairs = 2 stripes/pair * 2 pairs = 4 stripes

Hortense has double the number of stripes on her shoes compared to Olga. Since Olga has 6 stripes on each pair of shoes, Hortense has:
2 * 6 stripes = 12 stripes on each pair of shoes * 2 pairs = 24 stripes

Now, to find the combined number of stripes on all their pairs of shoes, we add the stripes together:

6 (Olga's stripes) + 4 (Rick's stripes) + 24 (Hortense's stripes) = 34 stripes

So the combined number of stripes is 34.

Rick has one less stripe per shoe than does Olga, so Rick has \(3 - 1 = 2\) stripes on each shoe. Therefore, Rick has \(2 \times 2 = 4\) stripes in total for each pair of shoes.

Hortense has double the number of stripes on her tennis shoes as does Olga, so she has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) stripes on each shoe. Therefore, Hortense has \(6 \times 2 = 12\) stripes in total for each pair of shoes.

To find the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes, we sum the contributions from Olga, Rick, and Hortense: 
\[3 + 4 + 12 = 19\] stripes per pair of shoes.

Since there are three of them, we multiply this total by 3 to get the combined number of stripes:
\[19 \times 3 = 57.\]

Therefore, the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes is 57.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of stripes for each person and then sum them up.

1. **Olga's Stripes:**
   - Olga has 3 stripes on each shoe.
   - Since she has two shoes per pair, her total number of stripes per pair is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

2. **Rick's Stripes:**
   - Rick has one less stripe per shoe than Olga, so he has \(3 - 1 = 2\) stripes on each shoe.
   - Therefore, his total number of stripes per pair is \(2 \times 2 = 4\).

3. **Hortense's Stripes:**
   - Hortense has double the number of stripes as Olga, so she has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) stripes on each shoe.
   - Thus, her total number of stripes per pair is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - We need to sum the stripes from all three people:
   \[
   6 \text{ (Olga)} + 4 \text{ (Rick)} + 12 \text{ (Hortense)} = 22
   \]

So, the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes is 22.

Let's start by determining the number of stripes on each person's tennis shoes.

1. **Olga:**
   - Olga has three stripes on each side of her tennis shoes.
   - This means she has \(3\) stripes per shoe.
   - Since she has two shoes per pair, the total number of stripes for Olga is:
     \[
     3 \text{ stripes/shoe} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 6 \text{ stripes/pair}
     \]

2. **Rick:**
   - Rick has one less stripe per shoe than Olga.
   - He has \(3 - 1 = 2\) stripes per shoe.
   - Therefore, his total number of stripes for one pair of shoes is:
     \[
     2 \text{ stripes/shoe} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 4 \text{ stripes/pair}
     \]

3. **Hortense:**
   - Hortense has double the number of stripes on her shoes as Olga.
   - Since Olga has \(3\) stripes per shoe, Hortense has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) stripes per shoe.
   - Thus, her total number of stripes for one pair of shoes is:
     \[
     6 \text{ stripes/shoe} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 12 \text{ stripes/pair}
     \]

Now, we need to find the combined number of stripes on all their pairs of tennis shoes:
- Olga's stripes: \(6\)
- Rick's stripes: \(4\)
- Hortense's stripes: \(12\)

Adding these together, we get:
\[
6 + 4 + 12 = 22
