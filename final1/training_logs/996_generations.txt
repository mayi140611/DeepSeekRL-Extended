To determine how much money was left from the plant supplier's earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total earnings from selling orchids.
2. Calculate the total earnings from selling potted Chinese money plants.
3. Sum these amounts to get the total earnings.
4. Subtract the expenses (workers' salaries and the cost of new pots) from the total earnings.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Earnings from selling orchids:
   - 20 orchids at $50 each = 20 * $50 = $1000

2. Earnings from selling potted Chinese money plants:
   - 15 plants at $25 each = 15 * $25 = $375

3. Total earnings:
   Total earnings = Earnings from orchids + Earnings from potted plants = $1000 + $375 = $1375

4. Expenses:
   - Workers' salaries: 2 workers * $40 each = 2 * $40 = $80
   - Cost of new pots: $150

5. Total expenses:
   Total expenses = Workers' salaries + Cost of new pots = $80 + $150 = $230

6. Money left:
   Money left = Total earnings - Total expenses = $1375 - $230 = $1145

Therefore, the plant supplier was left with $1145.

First, calculate the total earnings from selling the orchids:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \times \$50/\text{piece} = \$1000 \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from selling the potted Chinese money plants:
\[ 15 \text{ pieces} \times \$25/\text{piece} = \$375 \]

Add these amounts to find the total earnings:
\[ \$1000 + \$375 = \$1375 \]

Next, calculate the total expenses:
- Paying two workers $40 each:
\[ 2 \times \$40 = \$80 \]
- Buying new pots worth $150:
\[ \$150 \]

Add these expenses to the total earnings:
\[ \$1375 + \$80 + \$150 = \$1505 \]

Finally, calculate the remaining money after expenses:
\[ \$1505 - \$1505 = \$0 \]

Therefore, the plant supplier has \( \$0 \) left from his earnings.

To find out how much money is left, we need to calculate the total earnings and then subtract all the expenses.

First, calculate the earnings from the orchids:
\[ 20 \text{ orchids} \times \$50 \text{ per orchid} = \$1000 \]

Next, calculate the earnings from the potted Chinese money plants:
\[ 15 \text{ plants} \times \$25 \text{ per plant} = \$375 \]

Now, add the earnings from the orchids and the Chinese money plants together:
\[ \$1000 + \$375 = \$1375 \]

Now, calculate the total expenses:
\[ \$40 \text{ per worker} \times 2 \text{ workers} = \$80 \]
Additionally, subtract the cost of new pots:
\[ \$150 \]

Total expenses amount to:
\[ \$80 + \$150 = \$230 \]

Finally, subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the leftover money:
\[ \$1375 - \$230 = \$1145 \]

So, the plant supplier has \$1145 left from his earnings.

The plant supplier's earnings from selling orchids are: \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) dollars.
The earnings from selling potted Chinese money plants are: \(15 \times 25 = 375\) dollars.
So, the total earnings are \(1000 + 375 = 1375\) dollars.
He had to pay his two workers a total of \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dollars.
He also bought new pots worth \(150\) dollars.
So, the total expenses are \(150 + 80 = 230\) dollars.

The plant supplier earned money from selling 20 pieces of orchids at $50 each and 15 pieces of potted Chinese money plants at $25 each.
So, the total money earned from selling orchids is:
\( 20 \times 50 = \$1000 \)

The total money earned from selling the potted Chinese money plants is:
\( 15 \times 25 = \$375 \)

Therefore, the total money earned from all the sales is:
\( \$1000 + \$375 = \$1375 \)

The plant supplier then paid his two workers $40 each:
\( 2 \times 40 = \$80 \)

The plant supplier also bought new pots worth $150.

The total expenses were:

To find out how much money the plant supplier has left after paying his workers and buying new pots, we need to first calculate the total earnings from selling the orchids and the plants, and then subtract the cost of the workers' wages and the pots.

1. Calculate the earnings from the orchids:
   - The plant supplier sold 20 pieces of orchids for $50 each.
   - Earnings from orchids = 20 pieces * $50 piece = $1000.

2. Calculate the earnings from the plants:
   - The plant supplier sold 15 pieces of potted Chinese money plants for $25 each.
   - Earnings from money plants = 15 pieces * $25 piece = $375.

3. Total earnings = Earnings from orchids + Earnings from money plants = $1000 + $375 = $1375.

4. Subtract the cost of the workers' wages:
   - Each worker is paid $40, and there are two workers.
   - Total wages paid = 2 workers * $40 worker = $80.

5. Subtract the cost of the pots:
   - The pots cost $150.

6. Remaining money left = Total earnings - Total wages paid - Cost of pots = $1375 - $80 - $150 = $1145.

Thus, the plant supplier has $1145 left after paying his workers and buying the pots.

To calculate the total earnings of the plant supplier, we first need to calculate the total sales of the orchids and the potted Chinese money plants. The total sales from the orchids is 20 * $50 = $1000. The total sales from the potted Chinese money plants is 15 * $25 = $375. So the plant supplier's total earnings is $1000 + $375 = $1375.

Now, we need to calculate the total expenses. The plant supplier paid each of his two workers $40, so the total expense for the workers is $40 * 2 = $80. The plant supplier also bought new pots worth $150. So the total expenses are $80 + $150 = $230.

Finally, we can calculate how much money is left from the plant supplier's earnings by subtracting the total expenses from the total earnings: $1375 - $230 = $1145.

To find out how much money the plant supplier earned, we first calculate the total revenue from selling the orchids and the Chinese money plants. 

Revenue from orchids:
\( 20 \text{ orchids} \times \$50/\text{orchid} = \$1000 \)

Revenue from Chinese money plants:
\( 15 \text{ plants} \times \$25/\text{plant} = \$375 \)

Total revenue:
\( \$1000 + \$375 = \$1375 \)

Next, we calculate the total expenses:

Expenses:
\( 2 \text{ workers} \times \$40/\text{worker} = \$80 \)

Expenses for new pots:
\( \$150 \)

Total expenses:
\( \$80 + \$150 = \$230 \)

To find the remaining money, we subtract the total expenses from the total revenue:
\( \$1375 - \$230 = \$1145 \)

Therefore, the plant supplier had \$1145 left from his earnings.

To determine how much money was left from the plant supplier's earnings, we need to first calculate the total earnings from selling the orchids and Chinese money plants.

1. Calculate the earnings from the orchids:
   - The supplier sells each piece of orchid for $50.
   - He sells 20 pieces of orchid.
   - Total earnings from orchids = 20 orchids * $50/orchid = $1000.

2. Calculate the earnings from the potted Chinese money plants:
   - The supplier sells each piece for $25.
   - He sells 15 pieces of Chinese money plants.
   - Total earnings from Chinese money plants = 15 pieces * $25/piece = $375.

3. Add the earnings from both types of plants to find the total earnings:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from orchids + Earnings from Chinese money plants
   - Total earnings = $1000 + $375 = $1375.

4. Subtract the expenses from the total earnings:
   - The supplier pays two workers $40 each.
   - Total expenses for wages = 2 workers * $40/worker = $80.
   - The supplier also buys new pots worth $150.
   - Total expenses = $80 + $150 = $230.

5. Calculate the remaining money after expenses:
   - Remaining money = Total earnings - Total expenses
   - Remaining money = $1375 - $230 = $1145.

Therefore, the remaining money from the plant supplier's earnings is $1145.

To determine how much money was left from the plant supplier's earnings, we first need to calculate the total amount of money earned from selling the orchids and the potted Chinese money plants.

The plant supplier sold 20 pieces of orchids for $50 each, so the total amount earned from orchids is:
\[ 20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, the plant supplier sold 15 pieces of potted Chinese money plants for $25 each, so the total amount earned from potted Chinese money plants is:
\[ 15 \times 25 = 375 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives us the total earnings:
\[ 1000 + 375 = 1375 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the total amount paid to the workers and the cost of the new pots. The plant supplier paid each of his two workers $40 each, so the total amount paid to the workers is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the new pots is $150.

Now, we subtract the total expenses from the total earnings:
\[ 1375 - 80 - 150 = 1145 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money left from the plant supplier's earnings is $1145.

$150 for new pots = $150

Now, let's add all the expenses to find the total costs.
$80 (workers) + $150 (pots) = $230

Finally, let's subtract the total costs from the total earnings to find the remaining money.

Next, we calculate the total earnings from the potted Chinese money plants. The plant supplier sold 15 pieces for $25 each, so the total from the money plants is \(15 \times 25 = 375\) dollars.

The total earnings from both the orchids and the potted Chinese money plants is \(1000 + 375 = 1375\) dollars.

Then, the plant supplier paid his two workers $40 each, so the total payment to workers is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dollars.

Additionally, the plant supplier spent $150 on new pots.

The total expenses are \(80 + 150 = 230\) dollars.

Therefore, the money left after all expenses is the total earnings minus the expenses, which is \(1375 - 230 = 1145\) dollars.

The profits from selling orchids can be calculated by multiplying the price per orchid by the number sold: 20 orchids * $50/orchid = $1000. The profits from selling potted plants can be calculated similarly: 15 potted plants * $25/potted plant = $375. Combining these, the total earnings can be calculated as these profits added together: $375 + $1000 = $1375. The overall expenses were the cost of paying workers and to buy new pots: 2 workers * $40/worker + $150 = $240 + $150 = $390. The amount of money left after expenses is then: $1375 - $390 = $985.
