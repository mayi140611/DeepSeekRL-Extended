###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?

To determine the final weight of the box of goodies, we need to follow the steps Ken took to fill it with jelly beans, brownies, and gummy worms and calculate the weight at each step.

1. **Initial weight of jelly beans:** 2 pounds
   \[
   \text{Weight} = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Adding brownies:** To triple the weight of the jelly beans, we need to multiply the weight of the jelly beans by 3.
   \[
   \text{Weight} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 3 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, after adding brownies, the weight is 6 pounds.

3. **Adding more jelly beans:** Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.
   \[
   \text{Weight} = 6 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds} = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, after adding more jelly beans, the weight is 8 pounds.

4. **Adding gummy worms:** To double the weight of the jelly beans, we need to multiply the weight of the jelly beans by 2.
   \[
   \text{Weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 16 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, after adding gummy worms, the weight is 16 pounds.

Therefore, the final weight of the box of goodies is \(\boxed{16}\) pounds.

To determine the final weight of the care package, we need to follow the steps of weight addition and multiplication carefully:

1. Ken started with a box that weighs 2 pounds.
2. He added enough jelly beans to triple the weight:
   
   \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) pounds (after adding jelly beans)
3. He added another 2 pounds of jelly beans:

   \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) pounds (after adding jelly beans)
4. He added enough brownies to double the weight:

   \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) pounds (after adding brownies)
5. He added enough gummy worms to double the weight again:

   \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) pounds (after adding gummy worms)

So, the final weight of the box of goodies was **32 pounds**.

Ken started with a box weighing 2 pounds. He added jelly beans, which brought the weight to 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to triple the weight, so 6 * 3 = 18 pounds. Next, he added another 2 pounds, bringing the weight to 18 + 2 = 20 pounds. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight, so 20 * 2 = 40 pounds.

Therefore, the final weight of the box of goodies was 40 pounds.

First, we need to determine the weight of the jelly beans. We know that Ken started with a box that weighed the same as the jelly beans, so the weight of the jelly beans is 2 pounds. When he added the brownies, the weight tripled, so the weight of the brownies is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds. Ken then added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, which brought the total weight of the jelly beans to \(2 + 2 = 4\) pounds. Adding the weight of the brownies to the jelly beans gives us \(4 + 6 = 10\) pounds for the jelly beans and brownies combined.

Next, we need to determine the weight of the gummy worms. The final weight of the box was determined by doubling the weight of the jelly beans and brownies. Since the weight of the jelly beans and brownies was 10 pounds, the weight of the gummy worms is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) pounds.

Adding the weight of the gummy worms to the total weight gives us \(10 + 20 = 30\) pounds.  

Therefore, the final weight of the box of goodies was 30 pounds.

To determine the final weight of the box of goodies, we will follow the steps described and calculate the weight at each stage.

1. **Initial Step:**
   - Ken places a box on a scale.
   - The weight is 0 pounds.

2. **Adding Jelly Beans:**
   - Ken pours enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.
   - Weight: 2 pounds.

3. **Adding Brownies:**
   - Ken adds enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.
   - Weight: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

4. **Adding Another 2 Pounds of Jelly Beans:**
   - Ken adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans.
   - Weight: \(6 + 2 = 8\) pounds.

5. **Adding Gummy Worms:**
   - Ken adds enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.
   - Weight: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) pounds.

Therefore, the final weight of the box of goodies is **16 pounds**.

Let's break down the weight changes step by step:

1. Ken starts with no weight, and he adds enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.
2. He adds enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Since it started at 2 pounds, tripling it would be 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.
3. He then adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the weight to 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.
4. Finally, he adds enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. Since it started at 8 pounds, doubling it would be 8 * 2 = 16 pounds.

So, the final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds.

Initially, Ken places 2 pounds of jelly beans in the box. The weight of the box is:
\[
2 \text{ pounds}
\]

He then adds enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Therefore, the weight is:

\[
2 \text{ pounds} \times 3 = 6 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, he adds 2 more pounds of jelly beans:

\[
6 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, he adds enough gummy worms to double the weight. Therefore, the weight becomes:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 16 \text{ pounds}
\]

So the final weight of the box is:
\[
\boxed{16}

Reasoning:

To determine the final weight of the box of goodies, we need to follow the steps Ken took to fill it:

1. First, Ken added jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds, which is confirmed.
2. Then, he added enough brownies to triple the weight, which means he added \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) pounds of brownies.
3. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the weight up to \( 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \) pounds.
4. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight, which means he added \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) pounds of gummy worms.

Adding these together, the final weight of the box of goodies is \( 10 + 20 = 30 \) pounds.

Answer:

The final weight of the box of goodies was 30 pounds.

To find the final weight of the box of goodies, we need to follow the sequence of events described:

1. Ken initially places a box on a scale and pours in enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.
   - Initial weight = 2 pounds

2. He then adds enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.
   - Since the initial weight is 2 pounds, tripling the weight would be: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.
   - Weight after adding brownies = 6 pounds

3. Next, he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans.
   - Weight after adding more jelly beans = \(6 + 2 = 8\) pounds

4. Finally, he adds enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.
   - Doubling the current weight of 8 pounds would be: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) pounds.
   - Final weight of the box of goodies = 16 pounds.

Therefore, the final weight of the box of goodies was 16 pounds, in pounds.
