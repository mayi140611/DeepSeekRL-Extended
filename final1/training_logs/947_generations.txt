<reasoning>
To find the total amount of fish sold over the two weeks, we need to:

1. Determine the amount of salmon sold the following week.
   - Since the fishmonger sold three times more salmon the following week, we multiply the week one sales by 3.
   - Week one sales: 50 kg
   - Week two sales: \( 50 \text{ kg} \times 3 = 150 \text{ kg} \)

2. Add the sales from both weeks to find the total amount.
   - Total sales: \( 50 \text{ kg} + 150 \text{ kg} = 200 \text{ kg} \)

3. The total amount sold is 200 kg.

To find the total amount of fish sold over the two weeks, we need to first determine how much was sold the following week. Given that the fishmonger sold three times more the following week and that he sold 50 kg of salmon the first week, we can calculate the sales for the second week as follows:

\[ \text{Sales in the second week} = 3 \times 50 \text{ kg} \]

Then, we can find the total sales for the two weeks by adding together the sales from both weeks.

\[ \text{Total sales} = \text{Sales in the first week} + \text{Sales in the second week} \]

Let's calculate the total sales.
</reasoning>

<answer>
\[ \text{Sales in the second week} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ kg} \]
\[ \text{Total sales} = 50 + 150 = 200 \text{ kg} \]

To calculate the total amount of fish sold over the two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of salmon sold the following week.
2. Add the amount sold the first week to the amount sold the following week.

The fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon the first week. The following week, he sold three times more. This means that the amount sold in the following week is:
\[ 50 \text{ kg} \times 3 = 150 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total amount of fish sold in two weeks is the sum of the amount sold in the first week and the amount sold in the following week:
\[ 50 \text{ kg} + 150 \text{ kg} = 200 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fish sold in two weeks is 200 kg.

To find the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we'll first determine how much was sold during the first week and then twice this amount, since the second week saw three times the sales of the first week.

1. First week:
- The fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon.

2. Second week:
- He sold three times more, which is 3 * 50 kg = 150 kg.

3. Total sales over two weeks:
- We add the sales from both weeks: 50 kg + 150 kg = 200 kg.

So, the total amount of fish sold in two weeks is 200 kg.

The fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon in the first week. In the second week, he sold three times more, which means he sold \(3 \times 50 = 150\) kg. To find the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we add the two amounts together: \(50 + 150 = 200\) kg. So, the fishmonger sold 200 kg of fish in two weeks.

Let's calculate the total amount of fish sold in two weeks.

1. This week, the fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon.
2. The next week, he sold three times more than the previous week, so he sold \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \) kg.
3. To find the total sold over the two weeks, we add the two amounts together: \( 50 \, \text{kg} + 150 \, \text{kg} = 200 \, \text{kg} \).

Therefore, the fishmonger sold a total of 200 kg of salmon in two weeks.

2. The problem states that he sold three times more the following week.
3. Calculate the amount of fish sold in the second week:
   \[
   50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ kg}

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the amount of fish sold in the first week and the amount sold in the second week, and then sum these amounts.

1. The fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon in the first week.
2. In the second week, he sold three times more than he did the first week. Therefore, the amount sold in the second week is \( 50 \text{ kg} \times 3 = 150 \text{ kg} \).

Next, we add the amounts from both weeks to find the total amount of fish sold:
\[
50 \text{ kg} + 150 \text{ kg} = 200 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the total amount of fish sold in two weeks is 200 kg.

To find the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we first need to calculate the fish sold in the second week. Since the fishmonger sold three times more fish in the second week, we multiply the first week's sales by 3.

3 * 50 kg = 150 kg

Now we add the first week's sales to the second week's sales to find the total:
50 kg (first week) + 150 kg (second week) = 200 kg

So, the total amount of fish sold in two weeks is 200 kg.

To find the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we first need to determine how much fish was sold in the second week. Since the fishmonger sold three times more the following week, we can calculate the amount sold in the second week by multiplying the first week's sales by 3. Then we add the sales from the two weeks together to get the total amount sold. 

In the first week, the fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon. For the second week, he sold three times this amount, which is \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \) kg. 

The total amount of fish sold in two weeks is therefore \( 50 + 150 = 200 \) kg.

To determine the total amount of fish sold over the two weeks, we need to calculate the amount of salmon sold in each week and then sum them up.

In the first week, the fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon.

In the second week, he sold three times more than the first week, which means:
\[ 3 \times 50 \, \text{kg} = 150 \, \text{kg} \]

To find the total amount of fish sold in both weeks, we add the amounts from each week:
\[ 50 \, \text{kg} + 150 \, \text{kg} = 200 \, \text{kg} \]

Thus, the total amount of fish sold in the two weeks is 200 kg.

To find the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we first need to calculate the amount of salmon sold in the second week. 

Given that the fishmonger sold three times more salmon in the second week than in the first week, we can calculate the second week's sales by multiplying the first week's sales by 3:

\[ \text{Second week sales} = 3 \times \text{First week sales} \]
\[ \text{Second week sales} = 3 \times 50 \text{ kg} \]
\[ \text{Second week sales} = 150 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we add the sales from both weeks to find the total amount of fish sold:

\[ \text{Total salmon sold} = \text{First week sales} + \text{Second week sales} \]
\[ \text{Total salmon sold} = 50 \text{ kg} + 150 \text{ kg} \]
\[ \text{Total salmon sold} = 200 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fish sold in two weeks is 200 kg.

First, determine the amount of salmon sold in the second week. We know that the fishmonger sold three times more salmon in the second week than he did in the first week. Thus, the amount sold in the second week is:
\[ \text{Amount sold in the second week} = 3 \times 50 \text{ kg} \]

Next, add the amounts from both weeks to find the total amount of fish sold over the two weeks:
\[ \text{Total amount sold} = 50 \text{ kg} + (3 \times 50 \text{ kg}) \]

Let's calculate the total amount sold:
\[ \text{Total amount sold} = 50 \text{ kg} + (3 \times 50 \text{ kg}) = 50 \text{ kg} + 150 \text{ kg} = 200 \text{ kg} \]

To find the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of fish sold in the second week.
2. Add the amount from the first week to the amount from the second week.

From the information given:
- In the first week, the fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon.
- In the second week, he sold three times more fish than the first week, which means he sold \(3 \times 50 = 150\) kg of fish.

Now, let's add the amounts:
- First week: 50 kg
- Second week: 150 kg
- Total: \(50 + 150 = 200\) kg

So, the total amount of fish sold in two weeks is 200 kg.
