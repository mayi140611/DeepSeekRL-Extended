system
Tim's doctor visit cost $300.
His insurance covered 75% of the visit cost, so the insurance covered $300 * 0.75 = $225.
Therefore, Tim had to pay $300 - $225 = $75.

His cat's visit cost $120.
His pet insurance covered $60 of the visit cost, so the insurance covered 60% of the visit.
Therefore, Tim had to pay $120 * 0.60 = $72.

To find the total amount Tim paid, we add the amount he paid for his doctor's visit to the amount he paid for his cat's visit: $75 + $72 = $147.
