system
To find the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg, we need to first determine how many books each person has read. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Megan has read 32 books.
2. Kelcie has read \( \frac{1}{4} \) the amount of books that Megan has read.
   \[
   \text{Books read by Kelcie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8
   \]
3. Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read.
   \[
   \text{Books read by Greg} = 2 \times 8 + 9 = 16 + 9 = 25
   \]
4. Now, we add up the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg.
   \[
   \text{Total books read} = 32 + 8 + 25 = 65
   \]

To find the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg, we need to calculate the number of books each person has read and then sum these numbers.

1. Megan has read 32 books.

2. Kelcie has read \( \frac{1}{4} \) the amount of books that Megan has read. Therefore, Kelcie has read:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8 \text{ books}
   \]

3. Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read. Therefore, Greg has read:
   \[
   2 \times 8 + 9 = 16 + 9 = 25 \text{ books}
   \]

4. Now, we sum the number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg:
   \[
   32 + 8 + 25 = 65
   \]

Therefore, the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg is 65.

We start by finding out how many books Kelcie has read, which is 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read. Since Megan has read 32 books, Kelcie has read \( \frac{1}{4} \times 32 \) books.

Next, we find out how many books Greg has read, which is 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read. Let's denote the number of books Kelcie has read as \( K \). So Greg has read \( 2K + 9 \) books.

Now, let's calculate the numbers step by step.

First, calculate the number of books Kelcie has read:
\[ K = \frac{1}{4} \times 32 \]
\[ K = 8 \]

Next, calculate the number of books Greg has read:
\[ G = 2K + 9 \]
\[ G = 2 \times 8 + 9 \]
\[ G = 16 + 9 \]
\[ G = 25 \]

Finally, to find the total books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg:
\[ \text{Total books} = M + K + G \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 32 + 8 + 25 \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 65 \]

To find out how many books Kelcie and Greg have read, we can start by calculating the number of books Kelcie has read. Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read.

\( \text{Books read by Kelcie} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Books read by Megan} \)

\( \text{Books read by Kelcie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 32 \)

\( \text{Books read by Kelcie} = 8 \)

Now that we know Kelcie has read 8 books, we can calculate the number of books Greg has read, which is 9 more than twice the number of books Kelcie has read.

\( \text{Books read by Greg} = 2 \times \text{Books read by Kelcie} + 9 \)

\( \text{Books read by Greg} = 2 \times 8 + 9 \)

\( \text{Books read by Greg} = 16 + 9 \)

\( \text{Books read by Greg} = 25 \)

Now that we know the total number of books that Megan, Kelcie, and Greg have read, we can sum these numbers to get the total.

\( \text{Total books read} = \text{Books read by Megan} + \text{Books read by Kelcie} + \text{Books read by Greg} \)

\( \text{Total books read} = 32 + 8 + 25 \)

\( \text{Total books read} = 65 \)

To determine the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books Kelcie has read.
2. Calculate the number of books Greg has read.
3. Sum the number of books read by each of them.

Given:
- Megan has read 32 books.
- Kelcie has read \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of books that Megan has read.
- Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books Kelcie has read.
\[ \text{Books read by Kelcie} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Books read by Megan} = \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of books Greg has read.
\[ \text{Books read by Greg} = 2 \times \text{Books read by Kelcie} + 9 = 2 \times 8 + 9 = 16 + 9 = 25 \]

Step 3: Sum the number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg.
\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Books read by Megan} + \text{Books read by Kelcie} + \text{Books read by Greg} = 32 + 8 + 25 = 65 \]

Therefore, the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg is 65.

First, let's determine how many books Kelcie has read. Since Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read, we have:

Kelcie's books = 1/4 * Megan's books
Kelcie's books = 1/4 * 32
Kelcie's books = 8

Next, let's find out how many books Greg has read. Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read, which can be calculated as:

Greg's books = 2 * Kelcie's books + 9
Greg's books = 2 * 8 + 9
Greg's books = 16 + 9
Greg's books = 25

Now, let's sum the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg:

Total books = Megan's books + Kelcie's books + Greg's books
Total books = 32 + 8 + 25
Total books = 65

Therefore, the answer is 65 books total have Megan, Kelcie, and Greg read.

To find out how many books Greg has read, we start by calculating 1/4 of the number of books Megan has read, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8 \) books.

Kelcie has read \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the books that Megan has read, so let's find how many Kelcie has read:

\( \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8 \) books

Now, let's calculate how many books Greg has read. Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books Kelcie has read, so:

\( (2 \times 8) + 9 = 16 + 9 = 25 \) books

Now we can find the total number of books read by adding the number of books read by each person:

\( Megan's\ books + Kelcie's\ books + Greg's\ books = 32 + 8 + 25 \)

\( = 32 + 8 = 40 \)
\( = 40 + 25 = 65 \)

So the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg is 65 books.
