First, we calculate the total number of pens Lenny bought. She bought 20 boxes of pens, with each box containing 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of pens is:
\[ 20 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ pens/box} = 100 \text{ pens} \]

Next, we determine how many pens Lenny gave to her close friends. She gave away 40% of the pens:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pens} = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \text{ pens} \]

After giving pens to her close friends, the number of pens remaining is:
\[ 100 \text{ pens} - 40 \text{ pens} = 60 \text{ pens} \]

Next, we calculate how many pens Lenny gave to her classmates. She gave away one-fourth of the remaining pens:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \text{ of } 60 \text{ pens} = 0.25 \times 60 = 15 \text{ pens} \]

After giving pens to her classmates, the number of pens remaining is:
\[ 60 \text{ pens} - 15 \text{ pens} = 45 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, after giving pens to her close friends and classmates, Lenny is left with 45 pens.

To determine how many pens Lenny has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pens Lenny initially bought.
2. Determine how many pens she gave to her close friends.
3. Find out how many pens are left after giving some to her close friends.
4. Determine how many pens she gave to her classmates from the remaining pens.
5. Calculate the number of pens left after giving some to her classmates.

First, the total number of pens Lenny bought is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of pens per box:
\[ 20 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ pens/box} = 100 \text{ pens} \]

Next, she gave 40% of the pens to her close friends. To find out how many pens that is:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pens} = 0.4 \times 100 = 40 \text{ pens} \]

After giving 40 pens to her close friends, the number of pens left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pens} - 40 \text{ pens} = 60 \text{ pens} \]

Next, Lenny gave one-fourth of the remaining pens to her classmates:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \text{ of } 60 \text{ pens} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pens} \]

After giving 15 pens to her classmates, the number of pens left is:
\[ 60 \text{ pens} - 15 \text{ pens} = 45 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final number of pens Lenny has left is 45.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Lenny bought 20 boxes of pens, with each box containing 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of pens is:
   \[
   20 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ pens per box} = 100 \text{ pens}
   \]

2. Lenny gave 40% of the pens to her close friends. So, the number of pens given to her close friends is:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pens} = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \text{ pens}
   \]

3. After giving pens to her close friends, the number of pens left is:
   \[
   100 \text{ pens} - 40 \text{ pens} = 60 \text{ pens}
   \]

4. Lenny then gave one-fourth of the remaining pens to her classmates. The number of pens given to her classmates is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \text{ of } 60 \text{ pens} = 0.25 \times 60 = 15 \text{ pens}
   \]

5. After giving pens to her classmates, the number of pens left for Lenny is:
   \[
   60 \text{ pens} - 15 \text{ pens} = 45 \text{ pens}
   \]

So, the number of pens left for Lenny is 45.

Lenny bought a total of 20 boxes * 5 pens/box = 100 pens. She gave away 100 pens * 40% = 40 pens to her close friends. Thus, there are 100 pens - 40 pens = 60 pens left. She gave away 60 pens * 25% = 15 pens to her classmates. Thus, there are 60 pens - 15 pens = 45 pens left for Lenny.

Let's calculate the total number of pens Lenny bought. She bought 20 boxes, and each box had 5 pens, so the total number of pens is:
\[ 20 \times 5 = 100 \]

Lenny then gave 40% of the pens to her close friends. So, the number of pens given to her friends is:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

After giving 40 pens to her close friends, the number of pens Lenny had left is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, Lenny gave one-fourth of the remaining pens to her classmates. So, the number of pens given to her classmates is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]

After giving 15 pens to her classmates, the number of pens Lenny has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Therefore, Lenny had 45 pens left.

Let's calculate the total number of pens Lenny bought initially. 
$L = 20 \times 5 = 100$.

Lenny gave away 40% of her pens, so she gave away $0.4 \times 100 = 40$ pens.

Lenny then gave away one-fourth of the remaining pens to her classmates. The remaining pens before giving any to classmates were $100 - 40 = 60$ pens, and one-fourth of that would be $60 \div 4 = 15$ pens to her classmates.

Therefore, the number of pens that Lenny has left for herself is $60 - 15 = 45$ pens.

To determine how many pens Lenny has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pens Lenny initially bought.
2. Determine how many pens she gave to her close friends.
3. Find out how many pens are left after giving some to her friends.
4. Calculate how many pens she gave to her classmates after keeping some for herself.
5. Subtract the pens given to classmates from the remaining pens to find out how many pens Lenny has left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Lenny bought 20 boxes of pens, with 5 pens in each box. Therefore, the total number of pens is \(20 \times 5 = 100\).

2. She gave 40% of the pens to her close friends:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \text{ pens} \]
So, she gave 40 pens to her close friends.

3. After giving 40 pens to her close friends, the number of pens left is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ pens} \]

4. She then gave one-fourth of the remaining pens to her classmates:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \text{ of } 60 = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pens} \]
So, she gave 15 pens to her classmates.

5. After giving 15 pens to her classmates, the number of pens Lenny has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the number of pens left for Lenny is 45.

She gave 40% of the pens to her close friends, so she gave away 40/100 × 100 = 40 pens. 

After giving away 40 pens, Lenny has 100 - 40 = 60 pens left.
