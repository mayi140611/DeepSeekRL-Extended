###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

On Friday, Remy paid Sally’s Woodworking LLC a total of $20,700 for 150 pieces of furniture. Later that evening, the company’s accountant discovered that a new intern in the sales department had overcharged Remy. If the cost of a piece of furniture is $134, how much money will Sally’s Woodworking LLC reimburse Remy?

system
To find out how much money Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy, we first need to calculate the correct total cost for 150 pieces of furniture, given that each piece costs $134.

150 pieces * $134 per piece = $20,100

Now that we know the correct total cost is $20,100, we can find out how much overcharged Remy was by subtracting the original amount from the correct total cost.

$20,100 - $20,700 = -$600

Remy was actually overcharged by $600. Since Sally’s Woodworking LLC's accountant discovered the overcharge, the reimbursement amount will be $600.

To calculate the reimbursement, we first need to determine the total price of the furniture that Remy was supposed to pay correctly.

Total cost for 150 pieces of furniture = $20,700

Number of pieces of furniture = 150

To find the cost per piece of furniture, we can divide the total cost by the number of pieces:

Cost per piece = Total cost / Number of pieces
Cost per piece = $20,700 / 150
Cost per piece = $138

Now, we can calculate the overcharge per piece:

Overcharge per piece = Actual cost - Cost per piece
Overcharge per piece = $134 - $138
Overcharge per piece = -$4 (Note: This indicates a shortage, not an overcharge.)

Since the intern overcharged Remy, we need to determine how much money Sally’s Woodworking LLC needs to reimburse Remy for the overcharge. However, based on the given information, it seems there might be an error because the cost per piece that exceeds the cost per piece is unlikely. 

If we assume the overcharge was discovered and Remy needs to reimburse the cost excess, then Sally’s Woodworking LLC would need to reimburse Remy based on the actual overcharge, which we can't calculate without additional information like the overcharge amount per piece or the discrepancy amount.

Based on the given information, we cannot calculate the exact amount Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy without more details about the overcharge.

To find out how much money Sally's Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy, we need to calculate the amount of money that was overcharged. 

First, we find out how much each piece of furniture costs per piece:

Cost per piece of furniture = Total amount paid by Remy / Number of pieces of furniture
Cost per piece of furniture = $20,700 / 150
Cost per piece of furniture = $134

Next, we calculate the total amount that was overcharged:

Overcharged amount = Cost per piece of furniture * Number of pieces of furniture (since she overcharged by this amount for all pieces)
Overcharged amount = $134 * 150
Overcharged amount = $20,100

So, Sally's Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy $20,100.

The total cost of the furniture for 150 pieces is $20,700.
The cost of each piece of furniture is $134.

To find out the total cost of the furniture, we need to multiply the total cost by the number of pieces:
20,700 \* 150 = $3,105,000

Now, since Sally’s Woodworking LLC has overcharged Remy, the amount to be reimbursed is the difference between the actual cost and the amount paid:
3,105,000 - 20,700 = $3,084,300

Therefore, Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy $3,084,300.

The total amount Remy should have paid for 150 pieces of furniture at $134 each is calculated as follows:

\[
150 \times 134 = 20100
\]

The company overcharged Remy by the difference between the actual cost and the amount paid:

\[
20100 - 20700 = -600
\]

Since the amount overcharged is negative, Sally’s Woodworking LLC will need to reimburse Remy for the overcharge:

To find out how much money Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy, we first need to determine the correct cost per piece of furniture they should have received.

The total amount Remy paid was $20,700 for 150 pieces of furniture. So, we divide this amount by the number of pieces to get the correct cost per piece:

\[ \text{Correct cost per piece} = \frac{\text{Total amount paid}}{\text{Number of pieces}} = \frac{20,700}{150} \]

\[ \text{Correct cost per piece} = 138 \]

The intern overcharged Remy by $12 per piece, so we need to calculate the total difference to find out how much reimbursements will be required:

\[ \text{Total difference} = \text{Correct cost per piece} - \text{Overcharged amount per piece} \]

\[ \text{Total difference} = 138 - 12 \]

\[ \text{Total difference} = 126 \]

Therefore, Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy $126.

To determine how much Sally's Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy, we first need to calculate the correct total cost of the 150 pieces of furniture based on the correct cost per piece, which is $134.

The correct total cost can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Correct total cost} = 150 \times 134 \]

Given that Remy paid $20,700 for 150 pieces of furniture, we need to find out how much Remy underpaid or overpaid. The difference between the paid amount and the correct total cost will indicate how much money Remy will be reimbursed.

Let's calculate the correct total cost and then find the reimbursement amount:
\[ \text{Correct total cost} = 150 \times 134 = 19,950 \]

Now, subtract the paid amount from the correct total cost to find the reimbursement amount:
\[ \text{Reimbursement amount} = 19,950 - 20,700 = -750 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Remy overpaid and needs to reimburse Sally's Woodworking LLC by $750.

To find out how much money Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of the furniture Remy is supposed to purchase:**
   - Remy paid a total of $20,700 for 150 pieces of furniture.
   - To find the cost of each piece of furniture, we divide the total cost by the number of pieces:
     \[
     \text{Cost per piece} = \frac{\$20,700}{150 \text{ pieces}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost per piece} = \$138
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of money overcharged:**
   - Sally’s Woodworking LLC has overcharged Remy by the difference between the actual cost per piece and the supposed cost per piece:
     \[
     \text{Amount overcharged} = 138 \text{ dollars} - 134 \text{ dollars}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amount overcharged} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the reimbursement:**
   - Since the overcharge is $4 per piece, we need to determine the total reimbursement for all 150 pieces:
     \[
     \text{Total reimbursement} = 4 \text{ dollars/piece} \times 150 \text{ pieces}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total reimbursement} = \$600
     \]

So, \$600 will be reimbursed to Remy.

The total cost of the furniture is $20,700 for 150 pieces. To find the cost of one piece, we divide the total cost by the number of pieces:
$$ \frac{20,700}{150} = 138
$$
So, each piece of furniture costs $138. 

The intern was overcharging by $20,700 - 150 * $138 = $1,050.

Therefore, Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy $1,050.

To determine how much Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy, we need to calculate the total cost before the overcharge and then compare it to the amount Remy paid.

First, we calculate the total cost of the furniture without the overcharge:
\[ \text{Total cost before overcharge} = 150 \times 134 \]

Let's compute 150 * 134:
\[ 150 \times 134 = 150 \times (130 + 4) = 150 \times 130 + 150 \times 4 = 19500 + 600 = 20100 \]

The total cost before the overcharge was $20,100. Remy paid $20,700, so the overcharge is:
\[ 20700 - 20100 = 600 \]

Therefore, the amount Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy is $600.

To find out how much money Sally's Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy, we need to calculate the total cost without the overcharge and then subtract this from the amount Remy paid.

First, let's calculate the total cost without the overcharge:
Number of pieces of furniture = 150
Cost per piece of furniture = $134
Total cost without overcharge = Number of pieces of furniture × Cost per piece of furniture
Total cost without overcharge = 150 × $134 = $20,100

Now, we subtract this amount from the total amount Remy paid:
Amount Remy paid = $20,700
Amount to reimburse = Total cost without overcharge - Amount Remy paid
Amount to reimburse = $20,100 - $20,700 = -$600

Since the amount is negative, it means Sally's Woodworking LLC overcharged Remy by $600.
