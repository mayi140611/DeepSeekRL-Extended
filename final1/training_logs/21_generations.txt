To determine the number of beetles eaten each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of snakes eaten by jaguars each day.
2. Calculate the total number of birds eaten by snakes each day.
3. Calculate the total number of beetles eaten by birds each day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of snakes eaten by jaguars each day.
- Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day.
- There are 6 jaguars in the forest.
\[ \text{Total snakes eaten per day} = 6 \text{ jaguars} \times 5 \text{ snakes/jaguar} = 30 \text{ snakes} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of birds eaten by snakes each day.
- Each snake eats 3 birds per day.
- The total number of snakes eaten per day is 30.
\[ \text{Total birds eaten per day} = 30 \text{ snakes} \times 3 \text{ birds/snake} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of beetles eaten by birds each day.
- Each bird eats 12 beetles per day.
- The total number of birds eaten per day is 90.
\[ \text{Total beetles eaten per day} = 90 \text{ birds} \times 12 \text{ beetles/bird} = 1080 \text{ beetles} \]

Therefore, the total number of beetles eaten each day is 1080.

To determine how many beetles are eaten each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of snakes eaten per day by each jaguar.
2. Calculate the number of birds eaten per day by all the jaguars combined.
3. Calculate the number of beetles eaten per day by all the birds combined.

Step 1: Jaguars eat 5 snakes per day, so each snake eats \( \frac{1}{5} \) of a jaguar per day. Since there are 6 jaguars, the number of snakes eaten per day by all the jaguars is \( 6 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{5} \) snakes per day.

Step 2: Each snake eats 3 birds per day, so the number of birds eaten per day by all the snakes combined is \( \frac{6}{5} \times 3 = \frac{18}{5} \) birds per day.

Step 3: Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, so the number of beetles eaten per day by all the birds combined is \( \frac{18}{5} \times 12 = \frac{216}{5} = 43.2 \) beetles per day.

Therefore, the number of beetles eaten each day is 43.2.

To find out how many beetles are eaten each day, we first need to calculate the number of snakes and birds eaten by the jaguars, and then use that to find the number of beetles eaten.

Number of snakes eaten per day by 6 jaguars = 6 jaguars * 5 snakes/jaguars = 30 snakes

Each snake eats 3 birds, so the total number of birds eaten per day = 30 snakes * 3 birds/snake = 90 birds

Each bird eats 12 beetles, so the total number of beetles eaten per day = 90 birds * 12 beetles/bird = 1080 beetles

Therefore, 1080 beetles are eaten each day.

To find out how many beetles are eaten each day, we need to calculate the number of snakes eaten by the jaguars first, then the number of birds eaten by the snakes, and finally the number of beetles eaten by the birds.

1. Number of snakes eaten by each jaguar: 5
2. Total number of snakes eaten by all jaguars: \(5 \times 6 = 30\)
3. Number of birds eaten by each snake: 3
4. Total number of birds eaten by all snakes: \(30 \times 3 = 90\)
5. Number of beetles eaten by each bird: 12
6. Total number of beetles eaten: \(90 \times 12 = 1080\)

So, 1080 beetles are eaten each day.

To determine the number of beetles eaten each day in the forest, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of snakes eaten by jaguars each day:**
   - Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day.
   - There are 6 jaguars in the forest.
   - Therefore, the total number of snakes eaten by jaguars each day is:
     \[
     6 \text{ jaguars} \times 5 \text{ snakes/jaguar} = 30 \text{ snakes}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds eaten by snakes each day:**
   - Each snake eats 3 birds per day.
   - So, the total number of birds eaten by snakes each day is:
     \[
     30 \text{ snakes} \times 3 \text{ birds/snake} = 90 \text{ birds}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of beetles eaten by birds each day:**
   - Each bird eats 12 beetles per day.
   - So, the total number of beetles eaten by birds each day is:
     \[
     90 \text{ birds} \times 12 \text{ beetles/bird} = 1080 \text{ beetles}
     \]

Thus, the total number of beetles eaten each day in the forest is:
\[
\boxed{1080}

To determine the number of beetles eaten each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of snakes eaten by the jaguars each day.
2. Calculate the number of birds eaten by the snakes each day.
3. Calculate the number of beetles eaten by the birds each day.

Let's start with step 1. Since there are 6 jaguars and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, the total number of snakes eaten by the jaguars each day is:
\[ 6 \text{ jaguars} \times 5 \text{ snakes/jaguar} = 30 \text{ snakes} \]

Next, we move to step 2. Since each snake eats 3 birds per day, the total number of birds eaten by the snakes each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ snakes} \times 3 \text{ birds/snake} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we move to step 3. Since each bird eats 12 beetles per day, the total number of beetles eaten by the birds each day is:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} \times 12 \text{ beetles/bird} = 1080 \text{ beetles} \]

1. Calculate the number of birds eaten by the jaguars each day.
2. Calculate the number of snakes eaten by the birds each day.
3. Calculate the number of beetles eaten by the snakes each day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of birds eaten by the jaguars each day.
\[
\text{Number of birds eaten by jaguars} = \text{Number of jaguars} \times \text{Birds eaten per day per jaguar}
\]
\[
\text{Number of birds eaten by jaguars} = 6 \times 12 = 72
\]

Step 2: Calculate the number of snakes eaten by the birds each day.
\[
\text{Number of snakes eaten by birds} = \text{Number of birds eaten by jaguars} \times \text{Snakes eaten per day per bird}
\]
\[
\text{Number of snakes eaten by birds} = 72 \times 3 = 216
\]

Step 3: Calculate the number of beetles eaten by the snakes each day.
\[
\text{Number of beetles eaten by snakes} = \text{Number of snakes eaten by birds} \times \text{Beetles eaten per day per snake}
\]
\[
\text{Number of beetles eaten by snakes} = 216 \times 5 = 1080

To determine the number of beetles eaten each day, we need to establish the relationship between the animals and their daily consumption.

1. **Jaguars vs. Snakes:** Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. Since there are 6 jaguars in the forest, the total number of snakes consumed per day is:
   \[
   6 \text{ jaguars} \times 5 \text{ snakes/jaguars} = 30 \text{ snakes/day}
   \]

2. **Snakes vs. Birds:** Each snake eats 3 birds per day. With 30 snakes consumed, the total number of birds eaten per day is:
   \[
   30 \text{ snakes} \times 3 \text{ birds/snake} = 90 \text{ birds/day}
   \]

3. **Birds vs. Beetles:** Each bird eats 12 beetles per day. Consuming 90 birds each day gives us:
   \[
   90 \text{ birds} \times 12 \text{ beetles/bird} = 1080 \text{ beetles/day}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of beetles eaten each day is **1080**.

To find out how many beetles are eaten each day in the forest, we need to follow a step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of snakes eaten per day by all jaguars.
   - Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. There are 6 jaguars.
   - Total snakes eaten per day = Number of jaguars * Number of snakes per jaguar

   - Total birds eaten per day = Number of snakes * Number of birds per snake
   - Total birds eaten per day = 30 * 3
   - Total birds eaten per day = 90

3. Calculate the total number of beetles eaten per day by all birds.
