###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Flora has been experiencing frequent fractures. Dr. Juan has asked her to strengthen her bones by drinking 105 gallons of milk within 3 weeks. Flora thinks that drinking 3 gallons of milk daily will be enough, but her brother says she'll still need to drink more. To fulfill Dr. Juan’s requirement, how many more gallons must Flora drink daily?

system
To determine how many more gallons of milk Flora needs to drink daily to fulfill Dr. Juan's requirement, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks: \(3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}\).

2. Next, calculate the total amount of milk Flora thinks she needs to drink daily: \( \frac{105 \text{ gallons}}{21 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ gallons/day} \).

3. Finally, calculate how many gallons Flora needs to drink daily to meet the requirement if she drinks 3 gallons daily: \( \frac{105 \text{ gallons}}{21 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ gallons/day} \).

Since the amount she thinks she needs to drink daily (5 gallons) is already more than what the requirement (3 gallons) exceeds, she doesn't need to drink more than 3 gallons daily. Therefore, she will not drink any additional gallons beyond what she drinks daily.

To determine how many more gallons Flora needs to drink daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks:**
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Determine how many gallons Flora needs to drink in total:**
   \[
   21 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ gallons per day} = 105 \text{ gallons}
   \]
   (5 gallons per day is derived by dividing the total required gallons by the total number of days).

3. **Calculate how many gallons Flora will drink if she drinks 3 gallons per day for 21 days:**
   \[
   21 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ gallons per day} = 63 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Determine the additional gallons needed:**
   \[
   105 \text{ gallons} - 63 \text{ gallons} = 42 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Find out how many more gallons Flora needs to drink daily to reach the total of 42 gallons:**
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ gallons}}{21 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ gallons per day}
   \]

Conclusion: To fulfill Dr. Juan’s requirement, Flora must drink **2 gallons more per day**, on top of her original 3 gallons daily requirement.

To determine how many more gallons of milk Flora must drink daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement, first calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks:

\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Flora's brother says she'll need to drink 105 gallons of milk in 21 days. To find out how many gallons she needs to drink per day:

\[ \frac{105 \text{ gallons}}{21 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ gallons/day} \]

Flora thinks she needs to drink only 3 gallons daily. To find out how much more she needs to drink in addition to her daily goal:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/day} - 3 \text{ gallons/day} = 2 \text{ gallons/day} \]

Thus, Flora must drink 2 more gallons of milk daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement.

To determine how many more gallons of milk Flora needs to drink daily, we first need to calculate the total number of drinking days available within 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks would be equivalent to \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

Flora's brother suggests she drinks 3 gallons of milk daily. To find out how much milk she needs to drink in total in 21 days, we multiply 3 gallons by 21 days:
\[ 3 \text{ gallons/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ gallons} \]

Dr. Juan requires that Flora drink 105 gallons of milk in total. Therefore, the additional amount of milk Flora needs to drink daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement is the difference between the total required and the total she would drink if she drinks 3 gallons daily:
\[ 105 \text{ gallons} - 63 \text{ gallons} = 42 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the problem doesn't specify how many days out of the 21 days she needs to drink this additional milk, we can assume she needs to drink this additional milk every day to meet the requirement within the given time frame. Therefore, the number of additional gallons she needs to drink daily is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]

This assumes she needs to drink this 42 gallons over the course of 21 days, and since she drinks 3 gallons daily to meet the 3 gallons requirement, the difference is 4 gallons per day.

To determine how many more gallons Flora must drink daily to fulfill Dr. Juan's requirement, we start by calculating the daily requirement for Flora. Given that she needs to drink a total of 105 gallons in 3 weeks, and we know there are 7 days in a week, she needs to drink:

\( 105 \text{ gallons} \div 7 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ gallons/day} \)

Flora thinks she can get by with 3 gallons daily. Therefore, the additional required daily intake is:

\( 15 \text{ (required)} - 3 \text{ (intended)} = 12 \text{ gallons/day} \)

So, Flora must drink 12 more gallons daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement.

To determine how many more gallons Flora needs to drink daily to fulfill Dr. Juan's requirement, we first need to calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks.

\[ \text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Given that Flora needs to drink 105 gallons of milk within these 21 days, we can find out how many gallons she needs to drink daily by dividing the total number of gallons by the total number of days.

\[ \text{Daily requirement} = \frac{105 \text{ gallons}}{21 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ gallons/day} \]

Flora thinks she can drink 3 gallons daily, so we subtract this from the daily requirement to find out how much more she needs to drink daily.

\[ \text{Additional daily requirement} = 5 \text{ gallons/day} - 3 \text{ gallons/day} = 2 \text{ gallons/day} \]

Therefore, Flora must drink 2 more gallons daily to fulfill Dr. Juan's requirement.

Currently, Flora is drinking 3 gallons of milk daily for 3 weeks (21 days). To find out how many gallons she has already consumed, we can multiply 3 gallons by 21 days. 

\[ 3 \text{ gallons/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ gallons} \]

Dr. Juan requires her to drink 105 gallons of milk in total. To find out how many more gallons Flora needs to drink, we subtract the amount she has already consumed from the total requirement:

\[ 105 \text{ gallons} - 63 \text{ gallons} = 42 \text{ gallons} \]

Flora needs to drink 42 gallons more to fulfill Dr. Juan's requirement. To find out how many more gallons she needs to drink daily, we divide the remaining gallons by the number of days left in the period.

\[ \frac{42 \text{ gallons}}{21 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ gallons/day} \]

Therefore, Flora needs to drink an additional 2 gallons of milk daily to meet the requirement.

To determine how many more gallons of milk Flora needs to drink daily to fulfill Dr. Juan's requirement, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks.
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Determine the total amount of milk Flora needs to drink in 21 days.
   \[
   105 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. Let \( x \) be the number of gallons Flora needs to drink daily. Then, the total amount of milk she will drink in 21 days is \( 21x \). We set this equal to the total amount of milk needed by Dr. Juan.
   \[
   21x = 105
   \]

4. Solve for \( x \).
   \[
   x = \frac{105}{21} = 5

Flora needs to drink 5 gallons of milk daily to meet the requirement of 105 gallons over 21 days. Since Flora currently thinks she needs to drink 3 gallons daily, we need to find out how many more gallons she needs to drink daily.

5. Calculate the difference between the required daily consumption and the thought consumption.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2

To determine how many more gallons Flora needs to drink daily, let's first calculate how much milk Flora plans to consume daily and how much she will need in total over the 3 weeks.

Dr. Juan's requirement is 105 gallons of milk over 3 weeks, which is equivalent to 7 days (since 3 weeks = 21 days / 3 = 7 days).

Flora thinks she needs to drink 3 gallons daily and over 7 days, which totals:
\( 3 \text{ gallons/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ gallons} \)

Now, to find out how many gallons more Flora needs to drink daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement, we subtract the 21 gallons from the total required amount:
\( 105 \text{ gallons} - 21 \text{ gallons} = 84 \text{ gallons} \)

So, Flora needs to drink an additional:
\( 84 \text{ gallons} / 7 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ gallons/day} \)

Thus, Flora needs to drink an additional 12 gallons of milk daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement.

To determine how many more gallons Flora needs to drink daily to fulfil Dr. Juan’s requirement, we need to calculate the total amount of milk she will drink daily and see if it meets the requirement.

First, let's find out how many gallons of milk Flora will drink daily if she does it for the entire 3 weeks. Then we'll compare this to 105 gallons.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are:
\[3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}\]

If Flora drinks 3 gallons of milk daily, over 21 days she will drink:
\[3 \text{ gallons/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ gallons}\]

Dr. Juan wants her to drink 105 gallons within 3 weeks. Therefore, we need to determine how many more gallons she needs to drink daily to reach the total requirement:
\[105 \text{ gallons} - 63 \text{ gallons} = 42 \text{ gallons}\]

Now, to find how many gallons she must drink daily to accumulate these 42 gallons over 3 weeks, we divide 42 by 21:
\[42 \text{ gallons} \div 21 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ gallons/day}\]

Therefore, Flora needs to drink 2 more gallons of milk daily.

To determine how many more gallons of milk Flora needs to drink daily to fulfill Dr. Juan's requirement, we can start by calculating the total amount of milk Flora would drink if she drank 3 gallons daily.

First, we calculate the weekly milk consumption if Flora drinks 3 gallons daily:
\[ 3 \text{ gallons/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Next, we calculate how many weeks are in 3 weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, we find the total weekly milk consumption in 3 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 63 \text{ gallons} \]

Dr. Juan requires 105 gallons, so we need to find out how many more gallons are needed:
\[ 105 \text{ gallons} - 63 \text{ gallons} = 42 \text{ gallons} \]

To find out how many gallons of milk Flora needs to drink per day to meet this requirement, we divide the total additional gallons needed by the number of days in 3 weeks:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ gallons}}{21 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ gallons/day} \]
