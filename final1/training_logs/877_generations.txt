First, we need to determine the total time Mark spends in the theater per visit. Since each performance lasts 3 hours, the total time spent in the theater per visit is $3 \text{ hours} \times 6 = 18 \text{ hours}$. 

Next, since he visits the theater at least once a week for 6 weeks, the total time spent in the theater over 6 weeks is $18 \text{ hours/visit} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 108 \text{ hours}$.

The cost of each hour of theater visit is $5, so the total cost for 108 hours is $5 \times 108 = 540$. 

Therefore, Mark will spend $540 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks.

To calculate the total amount Mark will spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost for one performance:
   - The performance lasts 3 hours.
   - The ticket price is $5 per hour.

2. Calculate the total cost for one performance:
   - Cost for one hour = $5
   - Total cost for performance = 3 hours * $5/hour = $15

3. Determine the total cost for 6 weeks:
   - Mark goes to the theater once a week.
   - Total performances = 6 weeks
   - Total cost for 6 weeks = 6 performances * $15/performance

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 6 weeks.

4. Perform the calculation:
   - Total cost for 6 weeks = 6 * $15 = $90

Therefore, Mark will spend $90 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks.

Mark visits the theater once a week and each performance lasts 3 hours. The cost of the ticket is $5 for each hour spent. 

To find out how much Mark spends on each visit, we multiply the number of hours by the cost per hour:

\( 3 \text{ hours} \times $5/\text{hour} = $15 \text{ per visit} \)

Since Mark visits the theater once a week, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks to find out how much he spends in 6 weeks:

\( $15 \times 6 = $90 \)

So, Mark will spend $90 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks.

Mark visits the theater at least once a week for 6 weeks. Each performance lasts 3 hours, and the ticket price is $5 per hour. To calculate the total cost for 6 weeks, we need to consider the total number of performances and the cost per performance.

Number of performances per week = 1
Number of weeks = 6
Total number of performances in 6 weeks = 1 * 6 = 6
Total cost = Number of performances * Price per hour
Total cost = 6 * $5 = $30

So, Mark will spend $30 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks.

To determine how much Mark will spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks, we need to calculate the cost per visit and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

1. **Cost per visit**: Each performance lasts 3 hours, and the price per hour is $5. Therefore, the cost per visit is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$5/\text{hour} = \$15\).

2. **Number of visits in 6 weeks**: Mark visits the theater at least once a week. Over 6 weeks, he will have 6 visits.

3. **Total cost**: The total cost is the cost per visit multiplied by the number of visits. So, \(6 \text{ visits} \times \$15/\text{visit} = \$90\).

Now, let's calculate this step by step:

- Cost per visit = \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- Number of visits in 6 weeks = \(6\).
- Total cost = \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

To determine how much Mark will spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks, we need to calculate the cost of a single visit and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

1. **Cost of a single visit**: Each performance lasts 3 hours, and the ticket price is $5 per hour. So, the cost for a single performance is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times \$5/\text{hour} = \$15
   \]

2. **Total cost for 6 weeks**: Since Mark visits the theater at least once a week, we multiply the cost of a single visit by 6 weeks:
   \[
   6 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{week} = \$90
   \]

Therefore, Mark will spend $90 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks.
