system
First, calculate the total number of legs from the chairs and tables initially:

- Chairs: \(80 \times 5 = 400\) legs
- Tables: \(20 \times 3 = 60\) legs

Total number of legs = 400 (chairs) + 60 (tables) = 460 legs.

Next, calculate the number of chairs that are damaged:

- Number of damaged chairs = \(80 \times 40\% = 32\) chairs.

The number of chairs remaining is:

- Remaining chairs = 80 - 32 = 48.

The number of legs from the remaining chairs is:

- Legs from remaining chairs = \(48 \times 5 = 240\) legs.

The number of legs from the tables remains the same:

- Legs from tables = 60 legs.

Now, calculate the total number of remaining legs:

- Total remaining legs = Legs from remaining chairs + Legs from tables = 240 + 60 = 300.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the chairs. Kenzo has 80 chairs with five legs each, so:

\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs for the tables. Kenzo has 20 tables with three legs each, so:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

The total number of legs from both chairs and tables is:

\[ 400 + 60 = 460 \text{ legs} \]

After a month, 40% of the chairs are damaged and have to be disposed of. So, Kenzo loses:

\[ 40\% \times 400 = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

There are also 20 tables that are not damaged and still have their legs, so they remain without any loss. Therefore, 160 legs are lost from the chairs and 0 legs are lost from the tables.

The total number of legs remaining in the company is:

\[ 460 - 160 = 300 \text{ legs} \]

To determine the total number of legs remaining after 40% of the chairs are disposed of, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of damaged chairs.
2. Subtract the number of damaged chairs from the total number of chairs to find the number of remaining chairs.
3. Calculate the total number of legs of the remaining chairs.
4. Calculate the total number of legs of the round tables.
5. Add the legs from the remaining chairs and the round tables to get the total number of legs remaining.

Step 1: Calculate the number of damaged chairs.
Total number of chairs = 80
Percentage of chairs damaged = 40%
Number of damaged chairs = 80 * 40% = 80 * 0.4 = 32

Step 2: Subtract the number of damaged chairs from the total number of chairs.
Number of remaining chairs = 80 - 32 = 48

Step 3: Calculate the total number of legs of the remaining chairs.
Number of legs of remaining chairs = 48 chairs * 5 legs/chair = 240 legs

Step 4: Calculate the total number of legs of the round tables.
Number of round tables = 20
Number of legs per table = 3 legs/table
Total number of legs for round tables = 20 tables * 3 legs/table = 60 legs

Step 5: Add the legs from the remaining chairs and the round tables to get the total number of legs remaining.
Total number of legs remaining = 240 legs + 60 legs = 300 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining in his company is 300.

Reasoning:

1. First, calculate the total number of legs for the chairs and tables:
   - Chairs: 80 chairs * 5 legs = 400 legs
   - Tables: 20 tables * 3 legs = 60 legs
   - Total legs: 400 legs + 60 legs = 460 legs

2. Next, calculate how many chairs are left after 40% are damaged:
   - 40% of 80 chairs = 0.40 * 80 = 32 chairs
   - Remaining chairs: 80 chairs - 32 chairs = 48 chairs

3. Now, calculate the number of legs for the remaining chairs:
   - Remaining chairs: 48 chairs
   - Remaining legs: 48 chairs * 5 legs = 240 legs

4. Calculate the total number of legs remaining after disposing of the damaged chairs:

Reasoning:

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the office chairs and tables Kenzo originally had:

- Office chairs:
  \[
  80 \text{ chairs} \times 5 \text{ legs per chair} = 400 \text{ legs}
  \]

- Round tables:
  \[
  20 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 60 \text{ legs}
  \]

Next, we calculate the number of damaged chairs:

- 40% of the chairs are damaged:
  \[
  0.40 \times 80 = 32 \text{ chairs}
  \]

These 32 chairs are disposed of, but the original chairs that are still in use keep all their legs. Therefore, the number of legs in use remains the same. The number of chairs in use is:

\[
80 \text{ chairs} - 32 \text{ damaged chairs} = 48 \text{ chairs}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of legs of the furniture remaining:

- Legs from office chairs left in use:
  \[
  48 \text{ chairs} \times 5 \text{ legs per chair} = 240 \text{ legs}
  \]

- Legs from round tables:
  \[
  60 \text{ legs}
  \]

Adding these together, the total number of legs remaining is:

\[
240 \text{ legs (from chairs)} + 60 \text{ legs (from tables)} = 300 \text{ legs}
\]

Therefore, the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining in his company is 300.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the chairs and tables initially:

For the chairs:
80 chairs * 5 legs/chair = 400 legs

For the tables:
20 tables * 3 legs/table = 60 legs

Total number of legs initially is:
400 legs (chairs) + 60 legs (tables) = 460 legs

Next, since 40% of the chairs are damaged and disposed of:

40% of 80 chairs = 0.40 * 80 = 32 chairs

So, after disposing of the damaged chairs, Kenzo has:
80 chairs - 32 chairs = 48 chairs remaining

The total number of legs for the remaining chairs is:
48 chairs * 5 legs/chair = 240 legs

So, the total number of legs of furniture after disposing of the damaged chairs is:
460 legs (initial) - 160 legs (damaged chairs) + 240 legs (remaining chairs) = 540 legs

To find the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining, we need to calculate the total number of legs of chairs and tables first, and then determine the number of chairs that are not damaged.

First, calculate the total number of legs of chairs:
\[ 80 \text{ chairs} \times 5 \text{ legs per chair} = 400 \text{ legs} \]

Next, calculate the total number of legs of tables:
\[ 20 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Add the legs of chairs and tables to get the initial total number of legs:
\[ 400 \text{ legs} + 60 \text{ legs} = 460 \text{ legs} \]

Now, calculate the number of damaged chairs:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ chairs} = 0.4 \times 80 = 32 \text{ chairs} \]

Subtract the damaged chairs from the total chairs initially:
\[ 80 \text{ chairs} - 32 \text{ damaged chairs} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

Each of these 48 chairs still has 5 legs:
\[ 48 \text{ chairs} \times 5 \text{ legs per chair} = 240 \text{ legs} \]

Add the legs of the remaining chairs to the number of legs from the remaining tables:
\[ 240 \text{ legs of remaining chairs} + 60 \text{ legs of remaining tables} = 300 \text{ legs} \]

Therefore, the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining is:

To calculate the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs from the office chairs.
2. Calculate the number of damaged chairs.
3. Subtract the number of damaged chairs from the total number of chairs to find the number of intact chairs.
4. Calculate the total number of legs from the intact chairs.
5. Calculate the total number of legs from the round tables.
6. Sum the legs from the intact chairs and the round tables to get the total number of legs remaining.

Let's begin with step 1:
- Kenzo has 80 office chairs, each with 5 legs.
  Initial total legs from chairs = \( 80 \times 5 = 400 \) legs.

Step 2:
- 40% of the chairs are damaged, so we calculate 40% of 80.
  Number of damaged chairs = \( 0.40 \times 80 = 32 \) chairs.

Step 3:
- The number of intact chairs = initial chairs - damaged chairs.
  Intact chairs = \( 80 - 32 = 48 \) chairs.

Step 4:
- The total number of legs from the intact chairs is:
  Total legs from intact chairs = \( 48 \times 5 = 240 \) legs.

Step 5:
- Kenzo has 20 round tables, each with 3 legs.
  Total legs from round tables = \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) legs.

Step 6:
- The remaining total number of legs from furniture is:
  Total remaining legs = legs from intact chairs + legs from round tables.
  Total remaining legs = \( 240 + 60 = 300 \) legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining in his company is 300.

To calculate the total number of legs remaining in Kenzo's company, we first need to find out how many chairs and tables he had originally and then account for the damaged ones.

Initially, Kenzo has:
- 80 office chairs with 5 legs each = 80 * 5 = 400 legs
- 20 round tables with 3 legs each = 20 * 3 = 60 legs

Total number of legs at the beginning = 400 legs (from chairs) + 60 legs (from tables) = 460 legs

After a month, 40% of the chairs are damaged:
Amount of chairs damaged = 40% of 80 = 0.4 * 80 = 32 chairs
Therefore, the number of chairs remaining = 80 chairs - 32 chairs = 48 chairs

Total number of legs from the remaining chairs = 48 chairs * 5 legs/chair = 240 legs

The total number of legs from the tables remains the same as they were not damaged:

Total number of legs remaining in the company = 240 legs (from remaining chairs) + 60 legs (from tables) = 300 legs

4. Subtract the number of damaged chairs from the total number of chairs to find the remaining chairs.
5. Calculate the total number of legs of the remaining chairs.
6. Add the total number of legs of the round tables to the remaining legs of chairs.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Each office chair has 5 legs, and there are 80 office chairs.
   \[
   80 \text{ chairs} \times 5 \text{ legs per chair} = 400 \text{ legs}

To calculate the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining in his company, we need to first calculate the initial total number of legs and then subtract the number of legs from the chairs that are disposed of.

Initial total number of legs without damaged chairs: 80 chairs * 5 legs/chair = 400 legs
40% of the chairs are damaged and disposed of, so we need to calculate 40% of 80 chairs:

40% of 80 chairs = 0.4 * 80 = 32 chairs

Number of legs from the disposed chairs:
32 chairs * 5 legs/chair = 160 legs

Initial total number of legs = 400 legs without damaged chairs = 400 legs
Remaining legs after disposing of the damaged chairs:
400 legs - 160 legs = 240 legs

The round tables have no legs, so no need to subtract any legs from the tables.

Initially, Kenzo has 80 office chairs with five legs each, which totals \(80 \times 5 = 400\) legs. He also has 20 round tables with three legs each, which totals \(20 \times 3 = 60\) legs. So, the total number of legs in his company is \(400 + 60 = 460\).

After a month, 40% of the chairs are damaged and disposed of. Therefore, \(40\%\) of \(80\) chairs is disposed of, which is \(80 \times \frac{40}{100} = 32\) chairs. The number of legs from these disposed chairs is \(32 \times 5 = 160\).

The remaining number of chairs is \(80 - 32 = 48\), and the legs from these chairs is \(48 \times 5 = 240\).
