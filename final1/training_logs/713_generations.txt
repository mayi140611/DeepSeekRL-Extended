First, we need to determine how many shots Jake drank. Since Jake splits 8 shots with his friend, he drinks half of those shots. So, Jake drinks:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ shots} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of vodka Jake drinks. Since each shot is 1.5 ounces, we multiply:
\[ 4 \text{ shots} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces per shot} = 6 \text{ ounces of vodka} \]

Now, we need to find out how much of this alcohol is pure. Since the vodka is 50% pure alcohol, the amount of pure alcohol Jake drank is:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ ounces of pure alcohol} \]

To determine how much pure alcohol Jake drank, we first need to calculate the total amount of vodka he had. Jake splits 8 shots of vodka, and each shot is 1.5 ounces. Therefore, the total amount of vodka is:

\[ 8 \text{ shots} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces/shot} = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Since the vodka is 50% pure alcohol, we need to calculate 50% of the total amount of vodka to find out how much alcohol Jake consumed:

\[ 12 \text{ ounces} \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ ounces of pure alcohol} \]

So, Jake drank 6 ounces of pure alcohol.

First, we need to determine the total amount of vodka Jake and his friend each consume. Since there are 8 shots, and each shot is 1.5 ounces, the total volume of vodka is:
\[ 8 \text{ shots} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces/shot} = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Since Jake and his friend split the vodka equally, Jake gets half of the total volume:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ ounces}}{2} = 6 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we calculate the pure alcohol in Jake’s share. Since the vodka is 50% pure alcohol, we multiply Jake’s share of the vodka by 50% (or 0.5):
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ ounces} \]

That means Jake drank 3 ounces of pure alcohol.

In total, Jake and his friend drink 8 x 1.5 = 12 ounces of vodka. So Jake has to drink 12 / 2 = 6 ounces of vodka. Thus, Jake drinks 6 x 0.5 = 3 ounces of pure alcohol.

To determine how much pure alcohol Jake drank, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total volume of vodka Jake drank.
2. Determine the volume of pure alcohol in that total volume of vodka.

First, Jake splits 8 shots of vodka with his friend, so he drinks 4 shots (since he splits with an equal amount). Each shot is 1.5 ounces, so the total volume of vodka Jake drinks is:
\[ 4 \, \text{shots} \times 1.5 \, \text{ounces/shot} = 6 \, \text{ounces} \]

Next, since the vodka is 50% pure alcohol, the amount of pure alcohol in 6 ounces of vodka is:
\[ 6 \, \text{ounces} \times 0.5 = 3 \, \text{ounces of pure alcohol} \]

Therefore, Jake drank 3 ounces of pure alcohol.

To determine how much pure alcohol Jake drank, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of vodka Jake drank.
2. Determine the amount of vodka that is pure alcohol.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of vodka Jake drank.
Jake splits 8 shots of vodka with his friend, which means he gets 4 shots.
Each shot is 1.5 ounces, so:
\[ 4 \text{ shots} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces/shot} = 6 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 2: Determine the amount of vodka that is pure alcohol.
Vodka is 50% pure alcohol, so:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, Jake drank 3 ounces of pure alcohol.

To determine how much pure alcohol Jake consumed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total volume of vodka Jake and his friend shared.
2. Determine the amount of pure alcohol in that volume of vodka.

First, we know that Jake and his friend share 8 shots of vodka each. Each shot is 1.5 ounces. Therefore, the total volume of vodka is:
\[ 8 \text{ shots} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces per shot} = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that the vodka is 50% pure alcohol. Therefore, the amount of pure alcohol in the 12 ounces is:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces} \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Jake consumed 6 ounces of pure alcohol.

Jake and his friend split 8 shots of vodka, so Jake drinks 1/2 of the shots. Each shot is 1.5 ounces, so Jake drinks 1/2 * 1.5 = 0.75 ounces of vodka.

Vodka is 50% pure alcohol, so Jake drinks 50% * 0.75 = 37.5% pure alcohol from each shot. Since there are 8 shots, Jake drinks 8 * 0.375 = 3 ounces of pure alcohol.

Therefore, Jake drinks 3 ounces of pure alcohol.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of vodka Jake and his friend split. Since there were 8 shots and they split them equally, each of them had 4 shots. Each shot is 1.5 ounces, so the total amount of vodka is \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) ounces.

Since Jake splits the vodka with his friend, Jake drinks half of the total vodka. Therefore, Jake drinks \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) ounces of vodka.

Since vodka is 50% pure alcohol, the amount of pure alcohol Jake drank is \( 3 \times 0.5 = 1.5 \) ounces.
