Randy starts with $30. 
He spends $10 on lunch, so he has $30 - $10 = $20 left.
He then spends a quarter of the remaining $20 on an ice cream cone, which amounts to $20 / 4 = $5.
Therefore, the amount of money Randy has left is $20 - $5 = $15.

First, we need to determine how much money Randy has left after buying his lunch. He started with $30 and spent $10 on lunch, so he has $30 - $10 = $20 left.

Next, Randy spent a quarter of the money he had left on an ice cream cone. A quarter of $20 is $20 / 4 = $5. This means he spent $5 on the ice cream cone.

To find out how much money Randy has left, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cone from the money he had left after lunch. Therefore, Randy has $20 - $5 = $15 left.

The amount of money Randy has left is $15.

Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. Randy initially has $30.
2. He spends $10 on lunch, so he has \(30 - 10 = 20\) dollars left.
3. He spends a quarter of the money he had left on an ice cream cone. A quarter of $20 is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) dollars.
4. After buying the ice cream cone, Randy has \(20 - 5 = 15\) dollars left.

Therefore, the amount of money Randy has left is $15.

First, we need to determine how much money Randy has left after buying his lunch. Randy initially had $30 and spent $10 on lunch, so he has:

$30 - $10 = $20 left.

Next, we need to calculate how much Randy spent on the ice cream cone. According to the problem, he spent a quarter of the money he had left on the ice cream. So, we calculate a quarter of $20:

$\frac{1}{4} \times $20 = $5.

Randy spent $5 on the ice cream. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the cost of the ice cream from the remaining money after lunch:

$20 - $5 = $15.

Therefore, Randy has $15 left.

Let's proceed step by step to find out how much money Randy has left.

1. Initially, Randy had $30.
2. He spent $10 on lunch, so he spent and subtracted $10 from his total.
   $30 - $10 = $20.
3. Randy then spent a quarter (1/4) of the remaining $20 on an ice cream cone.
   $20 / 4 = $5.
4. The total amount spent on the ice cream is the $5 he added to his total from step 2.

Now we can find out how much money he has left:
$20 - $5 = $15.

Therefore, the amount of money Randy has left is $15.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Randy starts with $30.
2. He spends $10 on lunch. So, the amount left after buying lunch is:
   \( 30 - 10 = 20 \) dollars.
3. He then spends a quarter of the remaining money on an ice cream cone. A quarter of $20 is:
   \(\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5\) dollars.
4. The total amount spent on the ice cream cone is $5. So, the amount left after buying the ice cream cone is:
   \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Randy has left is 15 dollars.
