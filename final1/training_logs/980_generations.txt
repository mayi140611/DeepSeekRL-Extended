To determine how many pages are neither crumpled nor blurred, we need to calculate the number of pages that are crumpled, the number that are blurred, and the number that are both crumpled and blurred.

1. **Pages crumpled every 7th page:**

   - Total pages: 42
   - Pages crumpled every 7th page: \( \left\lfloor \frac{42}{7} \right\rfloor = 6 \) pages

2. **Pages blurred every 3rd page:**

   - Pages blurred every 3rd page: \( \left\lfloor \frac{42}{3} \right\rfloor = 14 \) pages

3. **Pages both crumpled and blurred:**

   - Pages both crumpled and blurred: \( \left\lfloor \frac{42}{21} \right\rfloor = 2 \) pages (since 21 is the least common multiple of 7 and 3)

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the pages that are both crumpled and blurred (to avoid double-counting):

- Pages neither crumpled nor blurred: \( 42 - 6 - 14 + 2 = 24 \)

First, let's determine how many pages are crumpled. Since the printer crumples every seventh page, we can divide 42 by 7 to find the number of crumpled pages:
$$
\frac{42}{7} = 6
$$
So, 6 pages are crumpled.

Next, let's determine how many pages are blurred. Since the printer blurs every third page, we can divide 42 by 3 to find the number of blurred pages:
$$
\frac{42}{3} = 14
$$
So, 14 pages are blurred.

Now, we need to determine if there are pages that both crumpled and blurred. To find this, we need to find the common multiples of 7 and 3. The least common multiple of 7 and 3 is 21. Therefore, every 21 pages, there will be one page that is both crumpled and blurred.

To find the number of such pages, we can divide 42 by 21:
$$
\frac{42}{21} = 2
$$
So, 2 pages are both crumpled and blurred.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred. To do this, we can add the number of crumpled pages and blurred pages and subtract the number of pages that are both crumpled and blurred:
$$
6 + 14 - 2 = 18
$$
So, 18 pages are either crumpled or blurred.

Finally, to find the number of pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred, we can subtract the number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred from the total number of pages:
$$
42 - 18 = 24
$$

Therefore, 24 pages are neither crumpled nor blurred.

James prints 42 pages. We need to determine how many pages, out of these 42 prints, are neither crumpled nor blurred. 

- Crumpling occurs on every 7th page: \( \frac{42}{7} = 6 \) pages.
- Blurring occurs on every 3rd page: \( \frac{42}{3} = 14 \) pages.

Because some pages may crumple and blur, we need to calculate the overlap. On every 21 pages (LCM of 7 and 3), the least significant overlap would be on page number 21. 

- Pages in 7th group: \( \left\lfloor \frac{42}{7} \right\rfloor = 6 \) pages.
- Pages in 3rd group: \( \left\lfloor \frac{42}{3} \right\rfloor = 14 \) pages.
- Overlap (pages in both groups): \( \left\lfloor \frac{42}{21} \right\rfloor = 2 \) pages.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we can find the number of pages that are crumpled or blurred:

\[ \text{Crumpled or Blurred} = \text{Crumpled} + \text{Blurred} - \text{Overlap} \]
\[ = 6 + 14 - 2 \]
\[ = 20 \]

Now, to find the number of pages which are neither crumpled nor blurred, we subtract the crumpled or blurred pages from the total number of pages:

\[ 42 - 20 \]
\[ = 22 \]

Therefore, there are 22 pages neither crumpled nor blurred.

To find the number of pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred, we first need to determine how many pages each condition affects.

1. Pages that are crumpled: Every seventh page is crumpled. Since 42 divided by 7 gives 6, there are 6 pages that are crumpled.

2. Pages that are blurred: Every third page is blurred. Since 42 divided by 3 gives 14, there are 14 pages that are blurred.

However, some pages might be counted twice since both conditions apply to certain pages. Pages that are both crumpled and blurred (i.e., pages that are multiples of both 7 and 3, i.e., multiples of 21) need to be identified separately.

1. Pages that are both crumpled and blurred: Since 42 divided by 21 gives 2, there are 2 pages that are both crumpled and blurred.

Since we can't double-count pages that fit this criterion, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of pages that are crumpled or blurred:

\[ 6 + 14 - 2 = 18 \]

So, 18 pages are either crumpled or blurred.

To find the number of pages that are neither, we subtract the number of crumpled or blurred pages from the total number of pages:

\[ 42 - 18 = 24 \]

Thus, 24 pages are neither crumpled nor blurred.

Let's calculate the number of pages that are crumpled and the number that are blurred:
- There are 42 pages printed in total.
- Crumpled pages: Since the printer crumples every seventh page, there are \( \frac{42}{7} = 6 \) crumpled pages.
- Blurred pages: The printer blurs the ink on every third page, so there are \( \frac{42}{3} = 14 \) blurred pages.

We need to calculate the overlap of crumpled and blurred pages. Since the printer crumples every seventh page and blurs every third page, every multiple of 21 (the least common multiple of 7 and 3) will be both crumpled and blurred. These multiples are 21, 42.

From these, we have:
- \( 21 \div 7 = 3 \) crumpled and blurred.
- \( 42 \div 7 = 6 \) crumpled and blurred.
- \( 21 \div 3 = 7 \) blurred but not crumpled.
- \( 42 \div 3 = 14 \) blurred but not crumpled.

The total number of pages that are either crumpled, blurred, or both is the sum of the individual counts minus the overlap:
- Total (crumpled or blurred) = \( 6 + 14 - 3 = 17 \).

Subtracting this from the total number of pages gives the number of pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred:
- Neither crumpled nor blurred = 42 - 17 = 25.

Therefore, 25 pages are neither crumpled nor blurred.

To determine how many pages are neither crumpled nor blurred, we need to calculate the total number of pages that are crumpled, blurred, and both crumpled and blurred.

First, we find the number of pages that are crumpled:
\[ \text{Pages crumpled} = \left\lfloor \frac{42}{7} \right\rfloor = 6 \]

Next, we find the number of pages that are blurred:
\[ \text{Pages blurred} = \left\lfloor \frac{42}{3} \right\rfloor = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the number of pages that are both crumpled and blurred:
\[ \text{Pages both crumpled and blurred} = \left\lfloor \frac{42}{21} \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred is:
\[ \text{Pages either crumpled or blurred} = \text{Pages crumpled} + \text{Pages blurred} - \text{Pages both crumpled and blurred} \]
\[ = 6 + 14 - 2 = 18 \]

To find the number of pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred, we subtract the pages that are either crumpled or blurred from the total number of pages:
\[ \text{Pages neither crumpled nor blurred} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Pages either crumpled or blurred} \]
\[ = 42 - 18 = 24 \]

Therefore, 24 pages are neither crumpled nor blurred.

To determine how many pages are neither crumpled nor blurred, we need to calculate how many pages are crumpled, how many pages are blurred, and then subtract the overlap (pages that are both crumpled and blurred) from the total number of pages.

1. **Pages crumpled**: There is no explicit restriction for crumpling in the problem statement, so we assume every 7th page is crumpled. To find the number of crumpled pages:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{7} \right\rfloor = 6
   \]
   So, 6 pages are crumpled.

2. **Pages blurred**: Every 3rd page is blurred. To find the number of blurred pages:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{3} \right\rfloor = 14
   \]
   So, 14 pages are blurred.

3. **Pages both crumpled and blurred**: To find the number of pages that are both crumpled and blurred, we need to find the common multiples of 7 and 3 within the range of 42 pages. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 3 is 21. The number of pages that are both crumpled and blurred:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{21} \right\rfloor = 2
   \]
   So, 2 pages are both crumpled and blurred.

4. **Pages neither crumpled nor blurred**: Subtract the number of crumpled pages from the total number of pages and subtract the number of blurred pages, then add back the overlap (since the overlap has been subtracted twice):
   \[
   42 - 6 - 14 + 2 = 24
   \]
   So, 24 pages are neither crumpled nor blurred.

To determine how many pages are neither crumpled nor blurred, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pages that are crumpled.
2. Calculate the number of pages that are blurred.
3. Calculate the number of pages that are both crumpled and blurred.
4. Use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred.
5. Subtract this number from the total number of pages to find the number of pages that are neither.

The total number of pages is 42. A page is crumpled if it is a multiple of 7, and a page is blurred if it is a multiple of 3. Therefore, a page is both crumpled and blurred if it is a multiple of both 7 and 3, i.e., a multiple of 21.

- The number of crumpled pages is \( \frac{42}{7} = 6 \).
- The number of blurred pages is \( \frac{42}{3} = 14 \).
- The number of pages that are both crumpled and blurred is \( \frac{42}{21} = 2 \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred is \( 6 + 14 - 2 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred is \( 42 - 18 = 24 \).

To determine how many pages are neither crumpled or blurred, we need to consider the constraints of each. A page is crumpled if it is a multiple of 7, and blurred if it is a multiple of 3. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.

The number of pages that are both crumpled and blurred (i.e., multiples of 21) can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of multiples of 21 between 1 and 42} = \left\lfloor \frac{42}{21} \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred is:
\[ 2 + 2 - 1 = 3 \]
(Note: We subtract 1 because the page that is a multiple of 21 twice is counted twice.)

Thus, the number of pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred is:
\[ 42 - 3 = 39 \]

Therefore, 39 pages are neither crumpled nor blurred.

To determine how many pages are neither crumpled nor blurred, we need to identify the pages that are printed within the 42-page range that are not divisible by 7 or 3. Since pages divisible by both 7 and 3 will be crumpled or blurred, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 3, which is 21, to find the pages that are crumpled or blurred.

Pages that are multiples of 21 are the ones that will be either crumpled or blurred. These pages are 42 / 21 = 2 pages. So, the pages that are crumpled or blurred are the 7th, 21st, and therefore the 42nd pages.

Next, we count the multiples of 7 that are less than or equal to 42 that are not divisible by 3, and then count the multiples of 3 that are less than or equal to 42 that are not divisible by 7. The multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and the multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, and 42.

We need to exclude the multiples of both 7 and 3 from these lists. Let's subtract the multiples of 21 (which are crumpled or blurred) from our original list.

42 pages total are printed.
7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th, 42nd are crumpled.
So, there are \(7 - 2 = 5\) pages that are crumpled.

15th, 21st, 27th, 33rd, 39th, 42nd are blurred.
So, there are \(15 - 2 = 13\) pages that are blurred.

The problem states that there are 12 unique pages. Therefore, there are \(42 - (5 + 13 + 3) = 21\) pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.

The total number of pages printed is 42, so if 21 pages are neither crumpled nor blurred, there are \(42 - 21 = 21\) pages neither crumpled nor blurred.

Therefore, the number of pages neither crumpled nor blurred is 21.

To find out how many pages are neither crumpled nor blurred, we need to determine how many pages fall into each category first.

- Pages that are crumpled: 7 out of 42 (7 out of 42 * 1/7 = 6)
- Pages that are blurred: 3 out of 42 (3 out of 42 * 1/3 = 1)

Since not crumpled or not blurred cannot overlap (since a page cannot be both crumpled and blurred), we add the two totals.

- Total pages neither crumpled nor blurred: 6 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the reason is that the printer crumples 7 pages and blurs 3 pages out of 42 pages, leaving 42 - 7 - 3 = 32 pages neither crumpled nor blurred.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred:

To find out how many pages are neither crumpled nor blurred, we need to first understand how frequently these events occur.
When a page is currelled, it is crumpled every 7 pages. So, for 42 pages, it would crumple 42 / 7 = 6 times.
When a page is blurred, it is blurred every 3 pages. So, for 42 pages, it would be blurred 42 / 3 = 14 times.
However, a page that is both currelled and blurred would be counted in both totals. So, we need to subtract the pages that are both currelled and blurred, which fall every least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 3 pages. LCM of 7 and 3 is 21. So, 21 pages would be both currelled and blurred.
Now, we want to find the pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred. First, we find the total number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred, which is 6 + 14 = 20.
Finally, we subtract the pages that are either crumpled or blurred from the total number of pages that James printed. 42 - 20 = 22 pages.
Thus, there are 22 pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.
