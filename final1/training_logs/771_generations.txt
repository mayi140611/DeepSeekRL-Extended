<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of pieces of fruit in bucket C as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 9 \). 

Bucket B has 3 more pieces of fruit than bucket C, so the number of pieces of fruit in bucket B (\( B \)) is given by:
\[ B = C + 3 \]
\[ B = 9 + 3 \]
\[ B = 12 \]

Bucket A has 4 more pieces of fruit than bucket B, so the number of pieces of fruit in bucket A (\( A \)) is given by:
\[ A = B + 4 \]
\[ A = 12 + 4 \]
\[ A = 16 \]

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of fruit in all three buckets by adding the number of pieces of fruit in each bucket together:
\[ \text{Total} = A + B + C \]
\[ \text{Total} = 16 + 12 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 37 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of fruit in all three buckets is 37.

Given that bucket C has 9 pieces of fruit, we can find the number of pieces of fruit in bucket B using the information that bucket B has 3 more pieces than bucket C. 

\[ \text{Fruit in B} = \text{Fruit in C} + 3 \]
\[ \text{Fruit in B} = 9 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Fruit in B} = 12 \]

Next, we find the number of pieces of fruit in bucket A using the information that bucket A has 4 more pieces than bucket B.

\[ \text{Fruit in A} = \text{Fruit in B} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Fruit in A} = 12 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Fruit in A} = 16 \]

Now we can add up all the fruits from the three buckets to get the total number of fruits.

\[ \text{Total Fruits} = \text{Fruit in A} + \text{Fruit in B} + \text{Fruit in C} \]
\[ \text{Total Fruits} = 16 + 12 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total Fruits} = 37 \]

<reasoning>
Let's define the number of fruits in bucket C as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C \) is 9 pieces of fruit. 

Bucket B has 3 more pieces of fruit than bucket C, so:
\[ B = C + 3 \]
Since \( C = 9 \), we have:
\[ B = 9 + 3 = 12 \]

Bucket A has 4 more pieces of fruit than bucket B, so:
\[ A = B + 4 \]
Since \( B = 12 \), we have:
\[ A = 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits in all three buckets, we sum the fruits in each bucket:
\[ \text{Total} = A + B + C \]
\[ \text{Total} = 16 + 12 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 37 \]

So, the total number of fruits in all three buckets is 37.

We are given that bucket C has 9 pieces of fruit.

Bucket B has 3 more pieces of fruit than bucket C. Therefore,
Bucket B has \( 9 + 3 = 12 \) pieces of fruit.

Bucket A has 4 more pieces of fruit than bucket B. Therefore,
Bucket A has \( 12 + 4 = 16 \) pieces of fruit.

To find the total number of pieces of fruit in all three buckets, we add the number of pieces in each bucket:
\( 9 + 12 + 16 = 37 \).

So, all three buckets together contain 37 pieces of fruit.

Let's denote the number of pieces of fruit in buckets A, B, and C as A, B, and C respectively. According to the problem statement, we have the following relationships:
- Bucket A has 4 more pieces of fruit than bucket B: \( A = B + 4 \) 
- Bucket B has 3 more pieces of fruit than bucket C: \( B = C + 3 \) 
- Bucket C has 9 pieces of fruit: \( C = 9 \)

We need to find the total number of pieces of fruit in all three buckets, which is \( A + B + C \).
Substituting the value of \( C \) into the equation for B, we get:
\( B = 9 + 3 = 12 \)

Now we can use the equation for A to find \( A \):
\( A = 12 + 4 = 16 \)

Finally, we can find the total number of pieces of fruit:
\( A + B + C = 16 + 12 + 9 = 37 \)

Therefore, the total number of pieces of fruit in buckets A, B, and C is 37.

To determine the total number of fruits in all three buckets, we can set up equations based on the information given.

First, we know that bucket C has 9 pieces of fruit:
\[ C = 9 \]

Next, bucket B has 3 more pieces of fruit than bucket C:
\[ B = C + 3 \]
Substituting the value of C:
\[ B = 9 + 3 = 12 \]

Finally, bucket A has 4 more pieces of fruit than bucket B:
\[ A = B + 4 \]
Substituting the value of B:
\[ A = 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we add the number of fruits in each bucket to get the total:
\[ A + B + C = 16 + 12 + 9 \]
\[ A + B + C = 37 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of fruit in all three buckets is 37.

Let's denote the number of pieces of fruit in bucket C as \( C \). Given that \( C = 9 \).

Bucket B has 3 more pieces of fruit than bucket C. So if \( B \) represents the number of pieces of fruit in bucket B, then \( B = C + 3 \).

Also, bucket A has 4 more pieces of fruit than bucket B. So if \( A \) represents the number of pieces of fruit in bucket A, then \( A = B + 4 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of pieces of fruit in bucket B:

B = C + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12

Next, we calculate the number of pieces of fruit in bucket A:

A = B + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16

Now, to find the total number of pieces of fruit in all three buckets, we sum the numbers we obtained:

Total = \( A + B + C = 16 + 12 + 9 \)

Let's calculate the total:

Total = 16 + 12 + 9 = 37

So, the total number of fruits in all three buckets is 37.
