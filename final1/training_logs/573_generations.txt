system
To find the total amount Pauline spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of taco shells**: The taco shells cost $5.

2. **Cost of bell peppers**: Pauline bought 4 bell peppers, each costing $1.5.
   \[
   4 \times 1.5 = 6
   \]
   So, the cost of the bell peppers is $6.

3. **Cost of meat**: Pauline bought 2 pounds of meat, and the meat costs $3 per pound.
   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6
   \]
   So, the cost of the meat is $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
5 + 6 + 6 = 17
\]

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $17.

To find out how much Pauline spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the taco shells is a fixed amount, so we don't need to include it in the calculation of the total spent.

2. The cost of the bell peppers: \(4 \text{ bell peppers} \times \$1.5 \text{ each} = \$6\).

3. The cost of the meat: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$3 \text{ per pound} = \$6\).

4. Adding these all together: \( \$6 + \$6 = \$12 \).

So, Pauline spent a total of \$12 on her dinner.

To find out how much Pauline spent in all, we need to calculate the total cost of each item she purchased and then sum them up.

1. **Taco shells**: She bought a box for $5.
2. **Bell peppers**: She bought 4 bell peppers, each costing $1.5. So, the total cost for bell peppers is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\).
3. **Meat**: She bought 2 pounds of meat at $3 per pound, so the total cost for meat is \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:

- Cost of taco shells: $5
- Cost of bell peppers: $6
- Cost of meat: $6

Total cost = $5 + $6 + $6 = $17.

Therefore, Pauline spent $17 in all.

To determine the total amount Pauline spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of taco shells**: The box of taco shells costs $5.

2. **Cost of bell peppers**: Each bell pepper costs $1.5, and Pauline bought 4 bell peppers.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of bell peppers} = 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of meat**: Pauline bought 2 pounds of meat at $3 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of meat} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total cost of all items**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of taco shells} + \text{Total cost of bell peppers} + \text{Total cost of meat}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 + 6 + 6 = 17 \text{ dollars}

To find out how much Pauline spent in all, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the cost of the taco shells:
\[ \text{Cost of taco shells} = \$5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the bell peppers:
\[ \text{Number of bell peppers} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost per bell pepper} = \$1.5 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for bell peppers} = 4 \times \$1.5 = \$6 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the meat:
\[ \text{Pounds of meat} = 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost per pound} = \$3 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for meat} = 2 \times \$3 = \$6 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of taco shells} + \text{Total cost for bell peppers} + \text{Total cost for meat} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$5 + \$6 + \$6 = \$17 \]

So, Pauline spent a total of \$17 on tacos for dinner.

To find out how much Pauline spent in all, we need to calculate the cost of each item she purchased and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the box of taco shells is $5.
2. The cost of the bell peppers is 4 bell peppers * $1.5 per bell pepper = $6.
3. The cost of the meat is 2 pounds * $3 per pound = $6.

Adding these amounts together:
$5 (taco shells) + $6 (bell peppers) + $6 (meat) = $17.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $17.

To find out how much Pauline spent in all, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum them up.

1. **Taco shells**: The cost is straightforward - $5.
2. **Bell peppers**: We know 2 bell peppers at $1.5 each, so the total cost is \(2 \times 1.5 = \$3\).
3. **Meat**: The meat costs $3 per pound, and Pauline bought 2 pounds, so the total cost is \(2 \times 3 = \$6\).

Now, we add up the costs of all items:
- Taco shells: $5
- Bell peppers: $3
- Meat: $6

Adding these amounts together: \(5 + 3 + 6 = \$14\).

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent is \(\$14\) in all.

Let's calculate the total cost step by step:

1. The cost of the taco shells is $5.
2. The cost of the bell peppers:
   - Pauline bought 4 bell peppers, and each cost $1.5.
   - Total cost for bell peppers = 4 * $1.5 = $6.
3. The cost of the meat:
   - Pauline bought 2 pounds of meat, and each pound costs $3.
   - Total cost for meat = 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Taco shells: $5
