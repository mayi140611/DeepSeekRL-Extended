system
At noon, the shadow is 0 feet long. Every hour, the shadow stretches by 5 feet. So after 6 hours, the shadow will be \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) feet long.

To convert this length to inches, we use the fact that 1 foot = 12 inches. Therefore, \( 30 \) feet is \( 30 \times 12 = 360 \) inches.

After every hour, the shadows are 5 feet long. So after 6 hours, the shadows will be 6 * 5 = 30 feet long.

To convert feet to inches, we multiply by 12, so 30 feet is equal to 30 * 12 = 360 inches.

Initially, the shadows are 0 feet. Since the shadows extend by 5 feet every hour, after 6 hours, the shadows will have extended by \(6 \times 5 = 30\) feet. 

To convert feet to inches, we use the fact that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 30 feet is equal to \(30 \times 12 = 360\) inches.
