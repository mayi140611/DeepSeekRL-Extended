###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A rectangular plot of private property is fenced in by a chain-link fence. The long sides of the plot are three times the length of the short sides. One short side of the fence is rusted from being hit by a sprinkler and needs to be replaced. If all the sides of the fence together are 640 feet long, how many feet of fence need to be replaced?

system
Let the length of the short side of the fence be \( x \) feet. Since the long sides are three times the length of the short sides, the length of the long side would be \( 3x \) feet. The total length of the fence, which is the perimeter of the rectangular plot, is given as 640 feet. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is calculated by the formula \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \). Substituting the given lengths, we get:
\[ 640 = 2 \times (x + 3x) \]
\[ 640 = 2 \times 4x \]
\[ 640 = 8x \]
\[ x = 640 / 8 \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the length of the short side, which needs to be replaced, is \( 80 \) feet.

system
Let the length of the short side of the fence be \( x \) feet. Since the long sides are three times the length of the short sides, the length of each long side is \( 3x \) feet.

The total length of the fence is the sum of the lengths of all four sides, which is given as 640 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2x + 4 \times 3x = 640 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 12x = 640 \]
\[ 14x = 640 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{640}{14} \]
\[ x = 46.4285714 \]

The length of each short side is approximately 46.43 feet. Since one short side needs to be replaced, the length of the fence that needs to be replaced is:
\[ x = 46.4285714 \]

To the nearest whole number:
\[ x \approx 46 \text{ feet} \]

Let's denote the length of the short side of the plot as \( L \). Since the long sides are three times the length of the short sides, the length of the long side is \( 3L \).

According to the problem, the total length of the fence is 640 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total length of the fence as:
\[
L + 3L + L + 3L = 640
\]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
8L = 640
\]
To find the length \( L \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[
L = \frac{640}{8} = 80
\]
So, the length of the short side of the plot is 80 feet.

Since one short side needs to be replaced, the length of the fence that needs to be replaced is:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]

Let's denote the length of the short side of the plot as \( x \). Then the length of the long side would be \( 3x \).

The total length of all sides of the fence is the sum of the lengths of the four sides, which is given as 640 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2x + 3x = 640 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 640 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{640}{5} \]

\[ x = 128 \]

So, the length of one short side that needs to be replaced is 128 feet.

Let's denote the length of the short side of the fence as \( s \) and the length of the long side as \( 3s \). According to the problem, the total length of the fence is 640 feet. This total length includes two short sides and two long sides. Thus, we can write the equation:

\[ 2s + 2(3s) = 640 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2s + 6s = 640 \]
\[ 8s = 640 \]
\[ s = 80 \]
