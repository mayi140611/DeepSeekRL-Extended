To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the ratio of tea to water for the mom's cup:**
   - Mom's tea cup size: 8 ounces
   - Mom's tea quantity: 1 ounce
   - Ratio: \(\frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \text{ ounces of water}}\)

2. **Determine the required tea quantity per person at the party:**
   - Each of the 12 people wants a 6-ounce cup of tea.
   - For one person: \(\frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{6 \text{ ounces of water}}\)

3. **Calculate the total amount of tea needed for all 12 people:**
   - Total tea for 12 people: \(12 \times \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{6 \text{ ounces of water}}\)

4. **Simplify the calculation:**
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ ounces of tea}
   \]

5. **Determine the total size of the party's tea cups:**
   - Each person gets a 6-ounce cup.
   - Total cups needed for the party: \(12 \times 6 \text{ ounces of tea}\)

6. **Calculate the total water needed for all tea cups:**
   - Water per cup size: 6 ounces
   - Total water for 12 cups: \(12 \times 6 \text{ ounces of water}\)

7. **Calculate the total tea needed:**
   - Using the ratio from step 1: \(\frac{2 \text{ ounces of tea}}{6 \text{ ounces of water}}\)

8. **Simplifying the calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ ounces of tea}}{6 \text{ ounces of water}} = \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{3 \text{ ounces of water}}
   \]

9. **Determine the total tea needed for the party:**
   - Total tea for the party: \(12 \times \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{6 \text{ ounces of water}}\)

To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis will need for the party, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of tea needed for one 6-ounce cup of tea.
2. Determine how much tea is needed for all 12 people.

**Step 1: Calculate tea needed for one 6-ounce cup.**

Artemis's mom uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup. For a 6-ounce cup, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio of tea to water:

\[
\text{Ratio of tea to water} = 1 \text{ ounce of tea} : 8 \text{ ounces of water}
\]

For a 6-ounce cup, let \(x\) be the amount of tea needed. The ratio should remain the same:

\[
\frac{x}{6} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ ounces of tea}
\]

So, for one 6-ounce cup of tea, Artemis will need \(\frac{3}{4}\) ounces of tea.

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of tea needed for 12 people.**

Since each of the 12 people wants a 6-ounce cup, we calculate the total tea needed:

\[
\text{Total tea needed} = 12 \times \frac{3}{4} \text{ ounces}
\]

\[
\text{Total tea needed} = 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4.5 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, Artemis needs 4.5 ounces of tea for the party.

To find out how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for the party, we'll use a proportion based on the ratio of tea to tea cup usage that her mom follows.

Given:
- Mom uses 1 ounce of tea for a 8-ounce tea cup.
- The party has 12 people.
- Each person wants a 6-ounce tea cup.

First set up a proportion for the mom's situation and extend it for the party:

\[
\frac{\text{Tea}}{\text{Tea Cup}} = \frac{1 \text{ ounce}}{8 \text{ fluid ounces}}
\]

We need to find the amount of tea (\( T \)) needed for the 12 people, with each person requiring 6 ounces of tea. Using the same ratio:

\[
\frac{T}{6 \text{ fluid ounces}} = \frac{1 \text{ ounce}}{8 \text{ fluid ounces}}
\]

Solve for \( T \) by cross-multiplying:

\[
8T = 1 \times 6
\]

\[
8T = 6
\]

Now divide both sides by 8:

\[
T = \frac{6}{8}
\]

\[
T = 0.75
\]

So, to find out how many ounces of tea she needs, divide the new amount of tea per person by the tea cups:

\[
\text{Total Tea} = \frac{6 \text{ fluid ounces}}{1 \text{ person}} \times 12 \text{ people} = 72 \text{ fluid ounces}
\]

Therefore, Artemis will need 72 ounces of tea for the party.

To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs, we must first calculate the amount of tea needed for a single 6-ounce cup for a single person based on the ratio. The ratio given is 1 ounce of tea per 8 ounces of tea for the mom.

1 ounce of tea â†’ 8 ounces of tea for mom

For 6 ounces of tea for a single person, we can set up a proportion:

1 ounce / 8 ounces = x ounces / 6 ounces

Solving this gives us:
x = (1 / 8) * 6 = 6/8 = 3/4 ounces of tea

Artemis will need 3/4 ounces of tea for each person at the party.

Since the party has 12 people:

Number of ounces needed = 12 * 3/4 = 36/4 = 9 ounces

So, Artemis needs 9 ounces of tea for the party.

To determine the amount of tea needed for the party, we start by understanding the ratio of tea to water used by Artemis's mom. Artemis's mom uses 1 ounce of tea for every 8 ounces of water, which simplifies to a ratio of 1:8.

Next, we need to calculate how much tea is required for the party. The party has 12 people, and each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. Therefore, the total amount of water needed is:
\[ 12 \text{ people} \times 6 \text{ ounces/person} = 72 \text{ ounces} \]

Given the ratio of 1:8 (1 ounce of tea to 8 ounces of water), we can set up the following proportion to find the amount of tea needed:
\[ \text{amount of tea} = \frac{1}{8} \times \text{amount of water} \]

Substituting the amount of water needed:
\[ \text{amount of tea} = \frac{1}{8} \times 72 \text{ ounces} = 9 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the amount of tea needed for the party is 9 ounces.

To determine how much tea Artemis needs for the party, we first need to calculate the required amount of tea for one person based on the ratio she is using for her mom.

Artemis' mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea using one ounce of tea. So, the ratio of tea to the total volume of tea is:

\[ \text{Ratio of tea to total volume} = \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \text{ ounces of tea}} \]

For a 6-ounce cup of tea, the required amount of tea can be calculated using the same ratio:

\[ \text{Required tea for one person} = \frac{1 \text{ ounce}}{8 \text{ ounces}} \times 6 \text{ ounces} = \frac{6}{8} = 0.75 \text{ ounces of tea} \]

Now, if there are 12 people at the party, we multiply the required amount of tea for one person by 12:

\[ \text{Total required tea} = 0.75 \text{ ounces} \times 12 \text{ people} = 9 \text{ ounces of tea} \]

So, Artemis needs 9 ounces of tea for the party.

To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. Determine the amount of tea needed for one person.
2. Calculate the total amount of tea needed for 12 people.

Step 1: Teas for one person
Since each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea and the ratio of tea to liquid ounces is 1:8 (1 ounce of tea for every 8 ounces of liquid), we can calculate the amount of tea needed for one person by proportion:

\[
\text{Tea needed for one person} = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right) \times 6 \text{ ounces}
\]

\[
\text{Tea needed for one person} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ ounces}
\]

Step 2: Total tea for 12 people
We need to multiply the amount of tea needed for one person by the number of people at the party:

\[
\text{Total tea needed for 12 people} = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times 12 \text{ ounces}
\]

\[
\text{Total tea needed for 12 people} = 9 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, Artemis will need 9 ounces of tea for the party.

To determine the amount of tea needed for the party, let's break down the process:

1. **Determine the ratio of tea to water:**
   - For her mom's 8-ounce cup of tea, she uses 1 ounce of tea.
   - This means the ratio of tea to water is 1 ounce of tea to 7 ounces of water (since 8 - 1 = 7).

2. **Calculate the total water needed for all 12 people:**
   - Each person wants a 6-ounce cup.
   - There are 12 people, so the total volume of water needed is:
     \[
     12 \times 6 \text{ ounces} = 72 \text{ ounces of water}
     \]

3. **Use the ratio to determine the amount of tea needed:**
   - The ratio of tea to water is 1:7.
   - For every 7 ounces of water, she uses 1 ounce of tea.
   - Therefore, for 72 ounces of water, the amount of tea needed is:
     \[
     \frac{72 \text{ ounces of water}}{7} \approx 10.29 \text{ ounces of tea}
     \]

So, Artemis needs approximately **10.29 ounces of tea** for the party. Given the usual practice, we would typically round up or down but let's round to two decimal places in this case. 

Answer: Artemis needs **10.29 ounces of tea** for the party.

To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for the party, we first need to see if the ratio of tea to water in her mom's cup applies to the party scenario. Her mom's cup uses one ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup of tea, so the ratio is \( \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \text{ ounces of water}} \). This means that for every 8 ounces of water, she uses 1 ounce of tea.

For the party, each of the 12 people wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. Therefore, we need to determine how much tea and water are required for each 6-ounce cup. Based on the ratio, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{The amount of tea for 6 ounces of water} = 6 \times \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \text{ ounces of water}} = \frac{6}{8} \text{ ounces of tea} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ ounces of tea} \]

Since there are 12 people, and each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea, the total amount of tea needed is:
