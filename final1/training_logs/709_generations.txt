<reasoning>
To determine how many fewer popsicle sticks the girls brought than the boys, we first need to calculate the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys and the girls separately.

The boys brought \(10 \times 15 = 150\) popsicle sticks each.
The girls brought \(12 \times 12 = 144\) popsicle sticks each.

The difference in the number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls and the boys is:
\(150 - 144 = 6\).

Therefore, the girls brought 6 fewer popsicle sticks than the boys.

To determine how many fewer popsicle sticks the girls brought than the boys, we need to calculate the total number of popsicle sticks for both groups.

First, calculate the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys:
\[ \text{Total boys' sticks} = \text{Number of boys} \times \text{Popsicle sticks per boy} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, calculate the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls:
\[ \text{Total girls' sticks} = \text{Number of girls} \times \text{Popsicle sticks per girl} = 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Now, find the difference between the total sticks brought by the boys and the girls:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total boys' sticks} - \text{Total girls' sticks} = 150 - 144 = 6 \]

So, the girls brought 6 fewer popsicle sticks than the boys.

Reasoning:
To determine how many fewer popsicle sticks the girls brought than the boys, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys.
2. Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls.
3. Find the difference between the number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys and the girls.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys.
The boys brought a total of 10 * 15 = 150 popsicle sticks.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls.
The girls brought a total of 12 * 12 = 144 popsicle sticks.

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys and the girls.
The girls brought fewer popsicle sticks than the boys by 150 - 144 = 6.

Therefore, the girls brought 6 fewer popsicle sticks than the boys.

Each of the ten boys brought 15 popsicle sticks, so the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ popsicle sticks} \]

Each of the twelve girls brought 12 popsicle sticks, so the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \text{ popsicle sticks} \]

To determine how many fewer popsicle sticks the girls brought than the boys, we subtract the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls from the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys:
\[ 150 - 144 = 6 \text{ fewer popsicle sticks} \]

Therefore, the girls brought 6 fewer popsicle sticks than the boys.

First, we calculate the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys. Ten boys, each bringing 15 popsicle sticks, bring \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) popsicle sticks. Next, we calculate the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls. Twelve girls, each bringing 12 popsicle sticks, bring \( 12 \times 12 = 144 \) popsicle sticks.

To find out how many fewer popsicle sticks the girls brought compared to the boys, we subtract the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls from the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys: \( 150 - 144 = 6 \).

Therefore, the girls brought 6 fewer popsicle sticks than the boys.
