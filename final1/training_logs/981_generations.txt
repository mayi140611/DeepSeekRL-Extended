To find out how many more times Susannah swam than Camden per week, we need to calculate the number of times each of them swam per week and then find the difference.

1. Camden's swimming frequency per week: 
   \[ \frac{16}{4} = 4 \text{ times per week} \]

2. Susannah's swimming frequency per week:
   \[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ times per week} \]

Now, to find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden:
\[ 6 - 4 = 2 \]

So, Susannah swam 2 times more per week than Camden.

To find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we first need to calculate the total number of times each of them swam in the month of March.

Camden swam 16 times in March.
Susannah swam 24 times in March.

Next, we divide the total number of swimming sessions by the number of weeks in March to find out the average number of times they swam each week.

\( \text{Total number of sessions} = 16 \text{ (Camden)} + 24 \text{ (Susannah)} = 40 \text{ sessions}\)

Since there are 4 weeks in March, we divide the total number of sessions by 4 to find the average number of sessions per week.

\( \text{Average number of sessions per week} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ sessions per week}\)

Now, we need to find out how many more times per week Susannah swam than Camden.

\( \text{Difference in number of sessions per week} = 24 - 16 = 8 \text{ sessions per week}\)

Therefore, Susannah swam 8 more times than Camden each week.

First, we need to calculate the number of times both Camden and Susannah went swimming each week.

1. For Camden:
   - March has 4 weeks.
   - He went swimming 16 times.
   - He went swimming \( \frac{16}{4} = 4 \) times a week.

2. For Susannah:
   - She went swimming 24 times.
   - She also went swimming \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) times a week.

Now, we need to find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden:
- Susannah swam 6 times a week.
- Camden swam 4 times a week.
- The difference is \( 6 - 4 = 2 \).

So, Susannah swam 2 more times a week than Camden.

To determine how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we first need to find out how many times they swam each week.

First, we calculate the number of times Camden swam per week. Since Camden swam 16 times in March and there are 4 weeks in March, we divide the total number of times Camden swam by the number of weeks:
\[ \text{Times Camden swam per week} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \text{ times per week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of times Susannah swam per week. Since Susannah swam 24 times in March and there are 4 weeks in March, we divide the total number of times Susannah swam by the number of weeks:
\[ \text{Times Susannah swam per week} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ times per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden. We do this by subtracting the number of times Camden swam per week from the number of times Susannah swam per week:
\[ \text{Difference} = 6 - 4 = 2 \]

So, Susannah swam 2 more times a week than Camden.

First, let's determine the total number of times Camden and Susannah went swimming in March.

For Camden: \( 16 \) times
For Susannah: \( 24 \) times

The total number of swims by both in March is: 
\( 16 + 24 = 40 \) swims

To find how many swims per week Camden went, divide the total number of swims by 4 weeks:
\( \frac{16}{4} = 4 \)

For Susannah, divide the total number of swims by 4 weeks:
\( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \)

Susannah went 2 more swims per week than Camden.

Therefore, Susannah went \( 2 \) more swims per week than Camden.

To determine how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we first need to calculate the average number of times each person swam per week.

Camden swam 16 times in March, so the average number of times per week is:
\[ \frac{16}{4} = 4 \text{ times per week} \]

Susannah swam 24 times in March, so the average number of times per week is:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ times per week} \]

Now, we subtract the weekly average of Camden from the weekly average of Susannah to find the difference:
\[ 6 \text{ times per week} - 4 \text{ times per week} = 2 \text{ times per week} \]

Therefore, Susannah swam 2 more times a week than Camden.

To determine how many more times Susannah swam than Camden each week, we first calculate the total number of times each went swimming over the 4-week period.

Camden went swimming 16 times per week, over 4 weeks, so:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \text{ times by Camden} \]

Susannah went swimming 24 times per week, over 4 weeks, so:
\[ 24 \times 4 = 96 \text{ times by Susannah} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more times Susannah swam than Camden per week:
\[ 96 \text{ (Susannah's times)} - 64 \text{ (Camden's times)} = 32 \text{ more times per week} \]

Therefore, Susannah swam 32 more times a week than Camden.

To find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we need to first calculate the number of times each of them swam per week.
Camden swam 16 times in March and there are 4 weeks in March, so Camden swam 16/4 = 4 times per week.
Susannah swam 24 times in March and there are 4 weeks in March, so Susannah swam 24/4 = 6 times per week.
Now we can calculate the difference between the number of times Susannah swam per week and the number of times Camden swam per week. The difference is 6 - 4 = 2.
Therefore, Susannah swam 2 more times a week than Camden.

First, let's calculate the average number of times Camden swam per week:
- Camden swam 16 times in March.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

\text{Camden's average per week} = \frac{16 \text{ times}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 4 \text{ times per week}

- There are 4 weeks in a month.

\[
\text{Susannah's average per week} = \frac{24 \text{ times}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 6 \text{ times per week}

To find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we first need to find the total number of times both swam in March. This can be done by adding the number of times Camden and Susannah swam, which comes to 16 + 24 = 40.

Since these occur over 4 weeks, we can find out how many times they each swam per week by dividing this number by 4, so Camden swam 40 / 4 = 10 times per week, while Susannah swam 24 / 4 = 6 times per week.

To find out how many more times per week Susannah swam than Camden, we subtract the number of times Camden swam per week from the number of times Susannah swam per week, which is 6 - 10 = -4.

The negative value indicates that Camden swam 4 more times per week than Susannah.

To determine how many more times Susannah swam than Camden per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of swims Camden and Susannah had in March.
   - Camden's total swims: 16
   - Susannah's total swims: 24

2. Add these totals together to find the combined total:
   - Total swims = 16 + 24 = 40

3. Calculate the average number of swims per week by dividing the total by 4:
   - Average swims per week = 40 ÷ 4 = 10

4. Determine how many more times Susannah swam than Camden per week by subtracting Camden's average swims per week from Susannah's average swims per week:
   - Difference = 10 (Susannah's average swims per week) - 16 (Camden's average swims per week) = -6

Since the result is negative, this indicates that Camden swims more times than Susannah per week. Therefore, Susannah swims 6 fewer times per week than Camden.

To solve this, we first find the total number of swim sessions each person had in March:
- Camden: 16 sessions
- Susannah: 24 sessions

The total number of sessions they had together in March is: \( 16 + 24 = 40 \) sessions. Now, we need to divide these sessions equally among 4 weeks. For Camden, this would be \( \frac{16}{4} = 4 \) sessions per week. Similarly, for Susannah, this would be \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) sessions per week.

Now, we need to find out how many more times per week Susannah swam compared to Camden:
\( Su\&n \) swam \( 6 \) times per week and \( Cam\&d \) swam \( 4 \) times per week. The difference is \( Su\&n - Cam\&d = 6 - 4 \).
