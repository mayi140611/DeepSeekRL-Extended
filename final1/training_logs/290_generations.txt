###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A family has three adults and children, both girls and boys. They went out for a family trip and prepared 3 dozen boiled eggs for the trip. Every adult got 3 eggs, and the boys each received 1 more egg than each girl since the girls had some snacks. How many boys went on the trip if the number of girls was 7 and each girl received an egg?

system
To determine the number of boys on the trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs distributed to the adults.
2. Determine the total number of eggs distributed to the girls.
3. Calculate the total number of eggs distributed to the boys.
4. Find the number of boys based on the number of eggs and the information about the children's snacks.

First, calculate the total number of eggs distributed to the adults:
\[ 3 \text{ adults} \times 3 \text{ eggs/adult} = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, determine the total number of eggs distributed to the girls:
\[ 7 \text{ girls} \times 1 \text{ egg/girl} = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Each girl received an egg, so we have 7 eggs for the girls. This means the remaining eggs must be for the boys:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} - 7 \text{ eggs} = 2 \text{ eggs} \]

Each boy received 1 more egg than each girl, so each boy received 2 eggs. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ eggs}}{2 \text{ eggs/boy}} = 1 \text{ boy} \]

So, the number of boys who went on the trip is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]

Every adult got 3 eggs, so the 3 adults got \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs. The girls received 7 eggs in total since each of the 7 girls received 1 egg. So the boys received \(3 \times 3 - 7 = 9 - 7 = 2\) eggs in total. Since each boy received 1 more egg than each girl (which is 1), each boy received 2 eggs. So the number of boys is \(2 \div 1 = 2\).

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Total number of eggs prepared: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
2. Each adult gets 3 eggs: 3 adults * 3 eggs = 9 eggs.
3. Each girl receives 1 egg: Since there are 7 girls, the total eggs for the girls is 7 * 1 = 7 eggs.
4. We need to find the number of boys. So, let's subtract the eggs given to the adults and girls from the total number of eggs: 36 eggs - 9 eggs - 7 eggs = 20 eggs.
5. Each boy gets 1 more egg than each girl, which means each boy gets 2 eggs. Therefore, to find the number of boys (let's call it B), we divide the number of eggs each boy gets by the number of eggs each boy gets: 20 eggs / 2 eggs per boy = 10 boys.

To determine the number of boys, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. There are three adults who received 3 eggs each.
2. The number of girls is 7, and each girl received 1 egg.
3. Each boy received 1 more egg than each girl, which is 2 eggs per boy.
4. The total number of eggs prepared is 3 dozen, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the adults and the girls:
- Total eggs for adults: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- Total eggs for girls: \(7 \times 1 = 7\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs remaining after the adults and girls have eaten:
- Remaining eggs = Total eggs - Eggs for adults - Eggs for girls
- Remaining eggs = 36 - 9 - 7 = 20 eggs.

Now, we need to determine the number of boys. Let \(B\) represent the number of boys. Each boy received 2 eggs:
\[ 2B = 20 \]

Solving for \(B\):
\[ B = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Therefore:
\[ \boxed{10} \]
is the number of boys who went on the trip.

Each adult received 3 eggs, so 3 adults received \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs. Each girl received 1 egg, so 7 girls received 7 eggs. Each boy received 1 more egg than each girl, so each boy received \(1 + 1 = 2\) eggs. Therefore, if there are \(x\) boys, the total number of eggs received by the boys is \(2x\). The total number of eggs is 3 dozen, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs. The equation for the total number of eggs is:
\[9 + 7 + 2x = 36\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[16 + 2x = 36\]
\[2x = 36 - 16\]
\[2x = 20\]
\[x = 10\]
So, there were 10 boys on the trip.

Total eggs prepared: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
Total eggs for adults: 3 adults * 3 eggs each = 9 eggs.
Total remaining eggs for children: 36 - 9 = 27 eggs.

Let's denote the number of boys as \( B \) and the number of girls as 7 (since each girl received an egg).

Each boy received 1 more egg than each girl, and since each girl received an egg, each boy received \( 7 + 1 = 8 \) eggs.

The total number of eggs for the children is the number of boys \(\times\) the number of eggs each boy received, which is \( 8B \).

Since all the remaining eggs were given to the children, we have:
\[ 8B = 27 \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{27}{8} = 3.375 \]

Since the number of boys must be a whole number, the only possible solution is if we consider the context of the problem is likely for an exact count, hence, rounding to the nearest whole number, the family had 3 boys.

<answer>
3
</answer>
<reasoning>
The problem states that every adult got 3 eggs and that the eggs were distributed such that each boy had 8 eggs (1 more than each girl). Given that there are 3 adults and they each got 3 eggs, the total eggs for adults is 9 eggs. The remaining eggs for children are 27 eggs, and each boy received 8 eggs. Therefore, the number of boys can be calculated by dividing the remaining eggs by the number of eggs each boy received, which is \( \frac{27}{8} = 3.375 \). Since the number of boys must be a whole number, rounding 3.375 to the nearest whole number gives us 3 boys.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####

Given that there are 3 adults and 7 girls, we know that each girl received 1 egg. The total number of eggs prepared is 3 dozen, which is 36 eggs. We need to determine how many boys there were, given that each boy received 1 more egg than each girl, and 7 girls each received 1 egg.

First, calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the girls:
\[ 7 \text{ girls} \times 1 \text{ egg/girl} = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Since each girl received 1 egg, they ate a total of 7 eggs. After all the girls have eaten their eggs, we have used up the first 7 eggs. This leaves us with:
\[ 36 \text{ eggs} - 7 \text{ eggs} = 29 \text{ eggs} \]

Let \( b \) be the number of boys. Each boy received 1 more egg than each girl, which means each boy received \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs eaten by the boys is:
\[ b \text{ boys} \times 2 \text{ eggs/boy} = 2b \text{ eggs} \]

Since the total number of eggs eaten by the boys must be equal to the remaining eggs:
\[ 2b = 29 \]

Solving for \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{29}{2} = 14.5 \]

Since the number of boys must be a whole number, we realize the calculation assumption might need rechecking, but based on the provided information, if each boy gets 2 eggs (more than girl's 1 egg), then:
\[ 7 (girls) + 14.5 (boys) \]

The question's structure might imply the exact 14.5 is not valid unless re-evaluated. Let's check with integers:
- Each girl ate 1 egg.
- Remaining eggs: 29. 
- With 14 boys, each getting 2 eggs:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 (28 actual by non-girl girls + boys), 29 - 28 = 1 remaining. 

Hence checking numbers again:
\[ 7 + 14.5 fits not integer, recheck problem statement for exact re-evaluation, likely 13 boys in whole context valid. Answer:

\[
\boxed{14.5 - adjusted integer 13}
\]

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Total number of eggs: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
2. Each adult gets 3 eggs.
3. Total number of eggs for adults = 3 adults * 3 eggs/adult = 9 eggs.
4. Eggs left for the girls = Total eggs - Eggs for adults = 36 - 9 = 27 eggs.
5. Number of girls: 7.
6. Each girl received 1 egg, so the total eggs given to girls = 7 girls * 1 egg/girl = 7 eggs.
7. Eggs left after girls: 27 - 7 = 20 eggs.
8. Eggs received by each boy = Eggs left for boys + 1 (since they each receive 1 more egg than the girls).
9. Let the number of boys be x.
10. Eggs per boy = x + 1.
11. Total eggs for boys = x * (x + 1) = 20.
12. Solving the equation x^2 + x - 20 = 0, we get (x - 4)(x + 5) = 0.
13. Since x cannot be negative, x = 4.

Therefore, the number of boys who went on the trip is 4.

To solve the problem, let's break it down into parts:

1. Let the number of boys on the trip be \( B \).
2. Each girl received 1 egg, so the girls together received \( 7 \) eggs.
3. The adults each received 3 eggs, so the adults together received \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) eggs.
4. The boys each received 1 more egg than each girl, so each boy received 2 eggs.
5. There were 3 dozen eggs prepared, which is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) eggs.

Now, let's set up the equation for the total number of eggs:
\[ 7 \text{ (eggs for girls)} + 9 \text{ (eggs for adults)} + 2B \text{ (eggs for boys)} = 36 \]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):

Let's denote the number of boys as \( b \).

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs distributed to the adults. Since each of the three adults received 3 eggs, the total number of eggs given to the adults is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that each of the 7 girls received 1 egg. Therefore, the total number of eggs given to the girls is:
\[ 7 \times 1 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Each boy received 1 more egg than each girl, so each boy received 1 + 1 = 2 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs given to the boys is:
\[ 2b \text{ eggs} \]

The total number of eggs prepared for the trip was 3 dozen, which is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we can sum the eggs given to the adults, the girls, and the boys to set up the equation:
\[ 9 + 7 + 2b = 36 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 16 + 2b = 36 \]

Subtract 16 from both sides to isolate the term with \( b \):
\[ 2b = 20 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( b \):
\[ b = 10 \]

So, the number of boys who went on the trip is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]
