28
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's calculate the weight lost by the second person:
The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person, who lost 27 kilograms. So the second person lost:
27 kilograms - 7 kilograms = 20 kilograms

Now, let's subtract the total weight loss of these two people from the overall total to find out how much the other two people lost together:
103 kilograms (total weight lost) - 27 kilograms (lost by first person) - 20 kilograms (lost by second person) = 56 kilograms (the amount lost by the last two people)

Since the last two people lost the same amount, we divide the 56 kilograms by 2:
56 kilograms รท 2 = 28 kilograms

Each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms of weight.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Four people lost a total of 103 kilograms of weight.
2. The first person lost 27 kilograms.
3. The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person.
4. The two remaining people lost the same amount.

First, we can determine how much weight the second person lost:
- The second person lost 27 kg - 7 kg = 19 kg.

Now, we subtract the weight lost by the first and second people from the total to find how much was lost by the remaining two people:
- 103 kg (total weight) - 27 kg (first person) - 19 kg (second person) = 57 kg.

Since the two remaining people lost the same amount of weight, we divide the remaining weight by 2:
- 57 kg รท 2 = 28.5 kg.

Therefore, the two remaining people each lost 28.5 kilograms.

system
Let's break down the problem:

1. We know the total weight lost by all four people is 103 kilograms.
2. The first person lost 27 kilograms.
3. The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person, which means the second person lost \( 27 - 7 = 20 \) kilograms.
4. Now we know the total weight loss for the first two people is \( 27 + 20 = 47 \) kilograms.
5. The remaining weight lost by the two last people is \( 103 - 47 = 56 \) kilograms.
6. Since these two people lost the same amount of weight, we divide the remaining weight by 2, which gives us \( 56 / 2 = 28 \) kilograms each.

Therefore, each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.

The second person lost 27 - 7 = 20 kilograms.
The total weight lost by the first and second persons is 27 + 20 = 47 kilograms.
The two last people must have lost 103 - 47 = 56 kilograms which is split between two people. Each must have lost 56/2 = 28 kilograms.

Let's denote the weight loss of the first person as \(W_1\) and the weight loss of the second person as \(W_2\). We know that:

\[W_1 = 27 \text{ kg}\]

The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person:

\[W_2 = W_1 - 7 = 27 - 7 = 20 \text{ kg}\]

The total weight loss by the first two people is:

\[W_1 + W_2 = 27 + 20 = 47 \text{ kg}\]

The rest of the weight loss (\(103 - 47 = 56 \text{ kg}\)) was lost by the last two people (who lost the same amount of weight) because:

\[W_{\text{total}} - W_1 - W_2 = 103 - (27 + 20) = 103 - 47 = 56 \text{ kg}\]

So, the last two people lost 28 kilograms each.

To find out how much each of the last two people lost, we need to determine how much the second person lost first.

1. **First Person** : The first person lost 27 kilograms of weight.

2. **Second Person** : The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person. 
   To find the second person's weight loss, we subtract 7 kilograms from the first person's weight loss:
   \[ 27 \, \text{kg} - 7 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

3. **Total Weight Loss** : We know that the total weight loss is 103 kilograms.
   We already have the weight losses of the first and second people, so we subtract these from the total:
   \[ 103 \, \text{kg} - 27 \, \text{kg} - 20 \, \text{kg} = 56 \, \text{kg} \]

4. **Remaining Weight Loss** : The remaining weight loss by the last two people is 56 kilograms. Since the remaining people lost the same amount of weight, each person lost half of this remaining weight.
   \[ \frac{56 \, \text{kg}}{2} = 28 \, \text{kg} \]

5. **Each Last Person** : Therefore, each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.

To summarize:
- The first person lost 27 kilograms.
- The second person lost 20 kilograms.
- Each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.

To find out how many kilograms each of the last two people lost, we first need to calculate the total weight lost by the first two people.

The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person, so they lost:
\[27 - 7 = 20 \text{ kilograms}\]

Now we add the weights lost by the first two people:
\[27 + 20 = 47 \text{ kilograms}\]

Since the four people lost a total of 103 kilograms, the last two people must have lost:
\[103 - 47 = 56 \text{ kilograms}\]

Since the two remaining people lost the same amount, each of them lost:
\[56 \div 2 = 28 \text{ kilograms}\]

So, each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.

To determine how many kilograms each of the last two people lost, we start by finding out how much weight the second person lost. The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person, so:

First person: 27 kilograms
Second person: 27 - 7 = 20 kilograms

Now we know the total weight lost by the first and second person is 27 + 20 = 47 kilograms. The total weight lost by all four people is 103 kilograms. Therefore, the weight lost by the last two people is:

Total weight lost - Weight lost by the first and second person = 103 - 47 = 56 kilograms

Since the last two people lost the same amount of weight, we divide the remaining weight by 2:

56 kilograms / 2 = 28 kilograms

Each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.

We can set up an equation to solve this problem. Let's denote the amount of weight the last two people lost as \( x \) kilograms each. We know that the first person lost 27 kilograms, and the second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person, which means the second person lost \( 27 - 7 = 20 \) kilograms.

The total weight lost by all four people is 103 kilograms. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 27 + 20 + 2x = 103 \]

Now let's solve this equation to find \( x \).

\[ 27 + 20 + 2x = 103 \]
\[ 47 + 2x = 103 \]
\[ 2x = 103 - 47 \]
\[ 2x = 56 \]
\[ x = \frac{56}{2} \]
\[ x = 28 \]

So, to find how much each of the last two people lost, we multiply \( x \) by 2: \( 28 \times 2 = 56 \) kilograms for each person.

Let's start by finding out how much weight the second person lost. The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person, so they lost \(27 - 7 = 20\) kilograms.

Now, we know the first person lost 27 kilograms and the second person 20 kilograms, so together they have \(27 + 20 = 47\) kilograms of weight loss.

Since the total weight loss among all four people was 103 kilograms, we can find out how much the remaining two people had to lose by subtracting 47 from 103. This gives us \(103 - 47 = 56\) kilograms of weight loss.

Since the two remaining people lost the same amount of weight, we can divide 56 by 2 to find out how much each person lost. So, each of the last two people lost \(56 \div 2 = 28\) kilograms.

Therefore, each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms of weight.

To determine how many kilograms each of the last two people lost, we start by calculating the weight lost by the second person. According to the problem, the second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person. Since the first person lost 27 kilograms, we can find the weight lost by the second person by performing the following subtraction:

\[ 27 - 7 = 20 \]

So, the second person lost 20 kilograms.

Next, we need to find out how much weight was lost by the first two people together. The total weight lost by the first two people is the sum of the weight lost by the first and second person:

\[ 27 + 20 = 47 \]

The remaining weight lost by the last two people is the total weight lost minus the weight lost by the first two people:

\[ 103 - 47 = 56 \]

Since the last two people lost the same amount of weight, we divide the remaining weight by 2:

\[ \frac{56}{2} = 28 \]

Therefore, each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.

The answer is: \(\boxed{28}\)
