system
Reasoning: 
To find out how many coins Elsa and Amalie have, we need to divide the total number of coins (440) by the sum of the ratio parts (10+45=55). 

Elsa's share = 440 * (10/55) = 80 coins
Amalie's share = 440 * (45/55) = 360 coins

Then, to find out how many coins Amalie will remain with, we need to calculate 3/4 of her total coins and subtract it from her initial total.

Amalie's remaining coins = 360 * (1 - 3/4) = 45 coins

Answer: Amalie will remain with 45 coins.

Given the ratio of coins Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of coins. Let's call the number of coins Elsa has "E" and the number of coins Amalie has "A". The total number of coins is the sum of these two, which is given as 440. Therefore, we have:

\[ E + A = 440 \]

The ratio 10:45 can be simplified to 2:9 by dividing both numbers by 5. This means that for every 2 coins Elsa has, Amalie has 9. Let's find out how many coins each of them has using the total number of coins and the ratio. Since the ratio is 2:9, we can write:

\[ E = 2x \]
\[ A = 9x \]

where \(x\) is a common multiplier. The sum of these coins is 440, so:

\[ (2x) + (9x) = 440 \]
\[ 11x = 440 \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Now we can find out how many coins each have:

\[ E = 2x = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]
\[ A = 9x = 9 \times 40 = 360 \]

Amalie spends \(\frac{3}{4}\) of her coins on toys. So, the amount she spends is:

\[ \text{Amount spent} = \frac{3}{4} \times 360 = 270 \]

Therefore, the number of coins she remains with is:

\[ \text{Coins remaining} = 360 - 270 = 90 \]

So, Amalie will remain with 90 coins.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of coins Elsa has as \( 10x \) and the number of coins Amalie has as \( 45x \). According to the given information, the ratio of coins they have together is 10:45, and the total number of coins they have is 440.

First, we set up the equation for the total number of coins:
\[
10x + 45x = 440
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives:
\[
55x = 440
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 55:
\[
x = \frac{440}{55} = 8
\]

Now, we can find the number of coins each person has. For Elsa, since \( x = 8 \):
\[
10x = 10 \times 8 = 80
\]
And for Amalie, since \( x = 8 \):
\[
45x = 45 \times 8 = 360
\]

Amalie spends \(\frac{3}{4}\) of her coins on toys, so she spends:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 360 = 270
\]

To find out how many coins she has left, we subtract the amount she spends from her initial number of coins:
\[
360 - 270 = 90
\]

Therefore, Amalie will remain with 90 coins.

To determine how many coins Amalie will have left after spending 3/4 of her coins on toys, we first need to find out how many coins each of them has.

Given that the ratio of coins Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45, we can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. Simplifying the ratio gives us 2:9.

Let's denote the number of coins Elsa has as \(2x\). Therefore, the number of coins Amalie has is \((45/2)x\).

The total number of coins they have together is given as 440. So, we can write the equation:
\[2x + (45/2)x = 440\]

First, we find a common denominator and add the terms:
\[2x + (45/2)x = (4x + 45x)/2 = 49x/2 = 440\]

Next, we solve for \(x\):
\[49x/2 = 440\]
\[49x = 440 \times 2\]
\[49x = 880\]
\[x = 880/49\]

The total number of coins Amalie has is:
\[(45/2)x = \frac{45}{2} \times \frac{880}{49} = \frac{45 \times 880}{2 \times 49} = \frac{45 \times 440}{49} = \frac{19800}{49} = 403.0606\]

Since the number of coins must be a whole number, we verify that \(x = 8\) fits the ratio and total coins:
Elsa has \(2x = 2 \times 8 = 16\) coins.
Amalie has \(45/2 \times 8 = 180/2 = 90\) coins.
Total number of coins is \(16 + 90 = 106\), which is not 440, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Given the error, let's correctly find \(x\) that fits the total coins:
\[2x + (45/2)x = 440\]
\[49x = 880\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Elsa has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) coins.
Amalie has \(45/2 \times 20 = 90\) coins.
Total coins are \(40 + 90 = 130\), which is not 440, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Correctly, we have \(x = 16\):
Elsa has \(2 \times 16 = 32\) coins.
Amalie has \(45/2 \times 16 = 360/2 = 180\) coins.
Total coins are \(32 + 180 = 440\).

If Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys:
\[3/4 \times 180 = 135\]

So, Amalie remains with:
\[180 - 135 = 45\]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[45\]

To determine how many coins Amalie will remain with, we first need to find out how many coins both Elsa and Amalie have. Given the ratio of their coins (Elsa:Amalie) is 10:45 and the total number of coins is 440, we can set up the following equation to find out how many coins each has:

Let the number of coins Elsa has be \(10x\) and the number of coins Amalie has be \(45x\). The total number of coins is given by \(10x + 45x = 440\).

Simplifying the equation:
\[55x = 440\]
\[x = \frac{440}{55}\]
\[x = 8\]

Now, substituting \(x = 8\) back into the expressions for the number of coins each has:
Elsa's coins: \(10x = 10 \times 8 = 80\)
Amalie's coins: \(45x = 45 \times 8 = 360\)

Next, we are told that Amalie spends \(\frac{3}{4}\) of her coins on toys. Therefore, the number of coins she spends is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 360 = 270\).

Subtracting the number of coins spent from the original number of coins Amalie had gives us the number of coins she remains with:
\[360 - 270 = 90\]

So, Amalie will remain with 90 coins.

Let's denote the number of coins Elsa has as E and the number of coins Amalie has as A.

Given the ratio of the coins they have, we have:
\[ \frac{E}{A} = \frac{10}{45} = \frac{2}{9} \]

This implies:
\[ E = \frac{2}{9}A \]

We are also told that the total number of coins they have is 440, so:
\[ E + A = 440 \]

Substituting the expression for E from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}A + A = 440 \]
\[ \frac{11}{9}A = 440 \]
\[ A = \frac{440 \times 9}{11} = 360 \]

So, Amalie has 360 coins. 

Now, Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys. Therefore, the number of coins she remains with is 1/4 of her total coins:
\[ \text{Coins Amalie remains with} = \frac{1}{4} \times 360 = 90 \]

So, Amalie will remain with 90 coins.

The ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45. This can be simplified to 2:9 by dividing both numbers by 5. 

Let's say the number of coins Elsa has is \(2x\) and the number of coins Amalie has is \(9x\). Together they have \(2x + 9x = 11x\). We know they have a total of 440 coins, so \(11x = 440\), which means \(x = 40\).

Therefore, Amalie has \(9x = 9 \times 40 = 360\) coins, and Elsa has \(2x = 2 \times 40 = 80\) coins.

Amalie spends \(3/4\) of what she has on toys, so she spends \(3/4 \times 360 = 270\) coins. 

Thus, she will remain with \(360 - 270 = \boxed{90}\) coins.

Given the ratio of coins that Elsa has to Amalie is 10:45, we can represent the number of coins Elsa has as \(10x\) and the number Amalie has as \(45x\).

Adding these together gives us the total number of coins:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of coins each person has and then calculate how many coins Amalie will have left after spending 3/4 of them on toys.

1. **Determine the number of coins each has initially:**

   Given the ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45, and their total number of coins is 440.

   Let:
   - \( E \) be the number of coins Elsa has.
   - \( A \) be the number of coins Amalie has.

   The ratio forms a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{E}{A} = \frac{10}{45}
   \]

   Simplify the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{E}{A} = \frac{2}{9}
   \]

   This means:
   \[
   E = \frac{2}{9}A
   \]

2. **Set up the total coins equation:**

   The sum of their coins is 440:
   \[
   E + A = 440
   \]

   Substitute \( E = \frac{2}{9}A \) into the total equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{9}A + A = 440
   \]

3. **Solve for \( A \):**

   Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   \frac{2}{9}A + \frac{9}{9}A = 440
   \]
   \[
   \frac{11}{9}A = 440
   \]

   Multiply both sides by 9 to isolate \( A \):
   \[
   11A = 440 \times 9
   \]
   \[
   11A = 3960
   \]

   Divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   A = \frac{3960}{11}
   \]
   \[
   A = 360
   \]

   So, Amalie initially has 360 coins.

4. **Calculate how many coins Amalie spends on toys:**

   Amalie spends \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her coins:
   \[
   \text{Coins spent} = \frac{3}{4} \times 360
   \]
   \[
   \text{Coins spent} = 270
   \]

5. **Calculate how many coins Amalie has left:**

   Subtract the coins spent from her total:
   \[
   \text{Coins left} = 360 - 270
   \]
   \[
   \text{Coins left} = 90
   \]

**Answer:**
Amalie will remain with 90 coins after spending \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what she has on toys.

Given the ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45, we can represent this as \( \frac{Elsa's \ coins}{Amalie's \ coins} = \frac{10}{45} \), simplifying to \( \frac{2}{9} \). Since the total number of coins they have together is 440, let's denote Amalie's coins as \( 45x \) and Elsa's coins as \( 10x \). Since these add up to 440, we can find \( x \) by solving \( 10x + 45x = 440 \), which simplifies to \( 55x = 440 \), dividing both sides by 55 we get \( x = 8 \). Therefore, Amalie has \( 45x = 360 \) coins, and Elsa has \( 10x = 80 \) coins.

Amalie spends \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what she has, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 360 = 270 \). The number of coins she remains with is \( 360 - 270 = 90 \) coins.

Reasoning:
To solve this, we first need to understand the ratio given and what it means for the total number of coins they have together. The ratio of coins that Elsa has to Amalie has is given as 10:45. This can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. Hence, the simplified ratio is 2:9, indicating that for every 11 parts of coins (10 + 45), Elsa has 2 parts while Amalie has 9 parts.

Given that together they have 440 coins, we can work out the value of one part. The total parts in the ratio represent the total number of coins, so if the ratio is 10 parts to 45 parts totaling 55 parts, each part represents \( \frac{440}{55} = 8 \) coins.

Elsa's share (2 parts) is thus \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) coins.
Amalie's share (9 parts) is \( 9 \times 8 = 72 \) coins.

Amalie spends \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what she has, which means she spends on toys \( \frac{3}{4} \times 72 = 54 \) coins.

Therefore, the number of coins Amalie remains with after spending is \( 72 - 54 = 18 \) coins.

Answer:
Amalie will have 18 coins remaining.

The given ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45. First, we can simplify this ratio to 2:9 by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. This means that for every 9 coins Amalie has, Elsa has 2 coins. Together, they have 2 + 9 = 11 parts of their coins.

Given that the total number of coins they have is 440, we can determine how many coins are in each part. This is done by dividing the total number of coins by the total number of parts, 440 = 11 x n. So n = 40, which means there are 11 parts in every unit.

The total number of coins that Amalie has is 9 parts. To find out how many Amalie will have left after spending 3/4 of her coins, we first calculate 3/4 of her coins: 3/4 x 9 = 27/4. Now, we subtract this amount from Amalie's total number of coins: 9 - 27/4 = 36/4. Therefore, after spending 3/4 of her coins on toys, Amalie will remain with 36/4 = 9 coins.

The answer is 9.

Let's reason through this step by step:

1) First, we can simplify the ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has. The ratio 10:45 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 5:
   10 ÷ 5 : 45 ÷ 5 = 2:9

2) This means that for every 2 coins Elsa has, Amalie has 9 coins. The total number of coins is 11 parts (2 + 9).

3) Since the total number of coins is 440, we can calculate the number of coins per part:
   440 ÷ 11 = 40 coins

4) Now we can find out how many coins each person has:
   - Elsa: 2 coins per part × 2 parts = 40 coins
   - Amalie: 9 coins per part × 9 parts = 81 coins

5) Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys, so she spends:
   3/4 × 81 = 60.75 coins

6) After spending 60.75 coins, Amalie will have:
   81 - 60.75 = 20.25 coins

7) Since we're dealing with whole coins, let's round this to 20 coins.

Therefore, Amalie will remain with 20 coins.

Given the ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45, we can simplify this ratio to 2:9 by dividing both numbers by 5. This means for every 2 coins Elsa has, Amalie has 9 coins.

Let's denote the number of coins Elsa has as \( E \) and the number of coins Amalie has as \( A \). The total number of coins can be expressed as \( E + A = 440 \). From the ratio, we know \( A = \frac{9}{2}E \).

Substituting \( A \) in the total number of coins equation, we get:
\[ 2E + \frac{9}{2}E = 440 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ \frac{4E + 9E}{2} = 440 \]
\[ \frac{13E}{2} = 440 \]
\[ 13E = 880 \]
\[ E = \frac{880}{13} \]
\[ E = 68 \]

So, Elsa has 68 coins. Since \( A = \frac{9}{2} \times 68 = 306 \), Amalie has 306 coins.

Amalie spends \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her coins on toys, so the number of coins she has left is:
\[ 306 - \frac{3}{4} \times 306 = 306 \times \left(1 - \frac{3}{4}\right) = 306 \times \frac{1}{4} = 76.5 \]

Since the number of coins must be a whole number, and typically in such problems, we assume the smallest whole number part, we can infer that the problem might be intended to have a result that fits whole coins. The closest possible interpretation would be as an integer, thus:

\[ 76.5 \approx 76 \]

So, Amalie remains with \boxed{76} coins.
