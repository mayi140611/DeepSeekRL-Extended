First, we need to find out the total number of bags of potatoes sold for the whole day. We do this by adding the number of bags sold in the morning to the number of bags sold in the afternoon:

Morning bags: 29
Afternoon bags: 17

Total bags sold = 29 + 17 = 46

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of potatoes sold. We do this by multiplying the total number of bags by the weight of each bag:

Weight per bag: 7 kg
Total bags sold: 46

Total weight of potatoes sold = 46 * 7 = 322 kg

Therefore, the shop sold 322 kilograms of potatoes for the whole day.

To find out the total kilograms of potatoes sold, we first need to determine the total number of bags sold during the whole day and then multiply that by the weight of each bag.

In the morning, the shop sold 29 bags of potatoes.
In the afternoon, the shop sold 17 bags of potatoes.

So, the total number of bags sold in a day is:
\[ 29 \text{ bags} + 17 \text{ bags} = 46 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag weighs 7kg, so the total kilograms of potatoes sold is:
\[ 46 \text{ bags} \times 7 \text{ kg/bag} = 322 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the shop sold a total of 322 kilograms of potatoes for the whole day.

To determine the total weight of potatoes sold in the whole day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bags sold in the whole day.
2. Multiply the total number of bags by the weight of each bag.

The shop sold 29 bags in the morning and 17 bags in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of bags sold is:

29 + 17 = 46 bags

Each bag weighs 7 kg. So, the total weight of potatoes sold in the whole day is:

46 bags * 7 kg/bag = 322 kg

To find out the total kilograms of potatoes sold for the whole day, we first need to calculate the total number of bags sold, which is the sum of the bags sold in the morning and the afternoon. Then, we multiply this total by the weight of each bag to get the total weight in kilograms.

The total number of bags sold = morning bags + afternoon bags = 29 + 17 = 46 bags

Each bag weighs 7kg, so the total weight = total number of bags × weight per bag
Total weight = 46 bags × 7kg/bag

Now, we perform the multiplication to get the total weight:
Total weight = 46 × 7 = 322 kg

Therefore, the shop sold a total of 322 kilograms of potatoes for the whole day.

To find out the total kilograms of potatoes sold by the shop, we need to first determine the total number of bags sold during the day. Then, we'll multiply that by the weight of each bag.

In the morning, the shop sold 29 bags of potatoes.
In the afternoon, the shop sold 17 bags of potatoes.

So, the total number of bags sold during the day is \(29 + 17 = 46\).

Each bag weighs 7 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the potatoes sold is \(46 \times 7 = 322\) kg.

To find out how many kilograms of potatoes the shop sold for the whole day, we need to calculate the total number of bags sold and then multiply by the weight of each bag.

First, let's determine the total number of bags sold:
- In the morning, the shop sold 29 bags.
- In the afternoon, the shop sold 17 bags.
$$
\text{Total bags sold} = 29 + 17 = 46
$$

Next, we multiply the total number of bags by the weight of each bag to find the total weight:
$$
\text{Total kg of potatoes sold} = 46 \text{ bags} \times 7 \text{ kg/bag}
$$

Now we perform the multiplication:
$$
46 \times 7 = 322 \text{ kg}
$$

Therefore, the shop sold a total of 322 kilograms of potatoes for the whole day.
