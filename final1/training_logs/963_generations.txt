To determine how many shirts Mary has left after giving some away, we'll first calculate how many shirts she gives away and then subtract that from the total she originally had.

Mary originally has:
- 26 blue shirts
- 36 brown shirts

She gives away half of her blue shirts. Half of 26 is:
\[ 26 / 2 = 13 \text{ blue shirts} \]

She also gives away a third of her brown shirts. A third of 36 is:
\[ 36 / 3 = 12 \text{ brown shirts} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining number of shirts she has left:
- Blue shirts left: \( 26 - 13 = 13 \)
- Brown shirts left: \( 36 - 12 = 24 \)

Total shirts left:
\[ 13 + 24 = 37 \]

Therefore, after giving away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, Mary has 37 shirts left.

Mary initially has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. She gives away half of her blue shirts, which is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) blue shirts. She also gives away a third of her brown shirts, which is \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) brown shirts.

After giving away these shirts, she has \( 26 - 13 = 13 \) blue shirts left and \( 36 - 12 = 24 \) brown shirts left.

To find the total number of shirts she has left, we add the remaining blue shirts and brown shirts: \( 13 + 24 = 37 \) shirts.

Therefore, Mary has 37 shirts left.

First, we need to determine how many shirts Mary gives away. She gives away half of her 26 blue shirts, which is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) shirts. She also gives away a third of her 36 brown shirts, which is \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) shirts. 

Next, we need to calculate how many shirts she has left. She originally had 26 blue shirts left after giving away half, so she has \( 26 - 13 = 13 \) blue shirts left. She originally had 36 brown shirts left after giving away a third, so she has \( 36 - 12 = 24 \) brown shirts left.

Finally, we add the remaining blue shirts and brown shirts to get the total number of shirts she has left. So, Mary has \( 13 + 24 = 37 \) shirts left in total.

To find out how many shirts Mary has left, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. Calculate the number of blue shirts Mary gives away: 
   26 blue shirts / 2 = 13 blue shirts

2. Calculate the number of brown shirts Mary gives away: 
   36 brown shirts / 3 = 12 brown shirts

3. Subtract the given shirts from the original amounts:
   - Blue shirts left: 26 - 13 = 13
   - Brown shirts left: 36 - 12 = 24

4. Add the remaining blue and brown shirts to find the total:
   13 blue shirts + 24 brown shirts = 37 shirts

Therefore, Mary has 37 shirts left.

First, let's calculate the number of shirts Mary gives away:

- She gives away half of her 26 blue shirts: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \) blue shirts.
- She gives away a third of her 36 brown shirts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) brown shirts.

Now, subtract the shirts given away from the original totals:

- Blue shirts left: \( 26 - 13 = 13 \) blue shirts.
- Brown shirts left: \( 36 - 12 = 24 \) brown shirts.

Finally, add the remaining blue and brown shirts to get the total:

- Total shirts left: \( 13 + 24 = 37 \) shirts.

Therefore, Mary has 37 shirts left.

First, we calculate the number of blue shirts Mary gives away. She has 26 blue shirts and gives away half of them, which is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) blue shirts. So, she has \( 26 - 13 = 13 \) blue shirts left.

Next, we calculate the number of brown shirts Mary gives away. She has 36 brown shirts and gives away a third of them, which is \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) brown shirts. So, she has \( 36 - 12 = 24 \) brown shirts left.

In total, the number of shirts Mary has left is the sum of the blue shirts and brown shirts she has left, which is \( 13 + 24 = 37 \).

Mary starts with 26 blue shirts and gives away half, which is 26 / 2 = 13 blue shirts. She gives away 13 blue shirts.

She starts with 36 brown shirts and gives away a third, which is 36 / 3 = 12 brown shirts.

In total, she gives away 13 + 12 = 25 shirts.

Subtracting the donated shirts from the original shirts leaves her with 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts, and 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts.

Therefore, she has 24 + 13 = 37 shirts left.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of blue shirts Mary gives away.
2. Subtract the given blue shirts from her total to find how many blue shirts she has left.
3. Calculate the number of brown shirts Mary gives away.
4. Subtract the given brown shirts from her total to find how many brown shirts she has left.
5. Add the remaining blue and brown shirts to find the total number of shirts left.

Let's start with the blue shirts:

- Mary has 26 blue shirts initially.
- She gives away half of her blue shirts, which is \( 26 \div 2 = 13 \) shirts.

Now, let's calculate the brown shirts:

- Mary has 36 brown shirts initially.
- She gives away a third of her brown shirts, which is \( 36 \div 3 = 12 \) shirts.

Now, we'll calculate the number of blue and brown shirts remaining:

- Blue shirts left: \( 26 - 13 = 13 \) shirts.
- Brown shirts left: \( 36 - 12 = 24 \) shirts.

Finally, we add the remaining blue and brown shirts to find the total number of shirts left:

- Total shirts left: \( 13 + 24 = 37 \) shirts.

So, Mary has 37 shirts left.
