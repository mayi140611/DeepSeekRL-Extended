system
To find out how many muffins each person will have, we need to divide the total number of muffins by the total number of people. So, we divide 20 muffins by 5 people.

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

So, each person will have 4 muffins.

To find out how many muffins each person will have, we need to divide the total number of muffins by the total number of people. Jessie invited 4 friends, making it 5 people in total (Jessie + 4 friends).

Total number of muffins = 20
Total number of people = 5

Number of muffins per person = 20 ÷ 5 = 4

So, each person will have 4 muffins.

To divide the muffins equally among Jessie and her 4 friends, we need to find out how many muffins each person gets. 
Let's start by calculating the total number of people: 1 (Jessie) + 4 (friends) = 5 people.

Now we need to divide the total number of muffins (20) by the total number of people (5). 
20 ÷ 5 = 4

So, each person will get 4 muffins.

Reasoning:

To determine how many muffins each person will have, we need to divide the total number of muffins by the total number of people. There are 5 people in total (Jesse and her 4 friends).

Total muffins = 20
Total people = 5

Each person will get muffins divided by the total number of people:

20 muffins ÷ 5 people = 4 muffins per person

Therefore, each person will have 4 muffins.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of people. Jessie is inviting 4 friends over, including herself. So, the total number of people is:
   \[
   1 + 4 = 5
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many muffins each person will get when they are divided equally. We have 20 muffins to divide among 5 people. We will perform the division:
   \[
   20 \div 5 = 4
   \]

3. Each person will get 4 muffins.

To find out how many muffins each person will have, we need to divide the total number of muffins by the total number of people. 

Total muffins = 20
Total people = Jessie + 4 friends = 1 + 4 = 5

Now, we divide the total number of muffins by the total number of people:

20 ÷ 5 = 4

Each person, including Jesse, will have 4 muffins.

<reasoning>
To find out how many muffins each person will have, we need to divide the total number of muffins by the number of people. In this case, Jessie is one person and her 4 friends add up to 5 people, making a total of 6 people. 

So, we have:

\[ \text{Total muffins} = 20 \]
\[ \text{Number of people} = 6 \]

Each person will have:

\[ \frac{\text{Total muffins}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{20}{6} \]

To calculate that, we divide 20 by 6, which gives us approximately 3.33 muffins per person.

Since you can't have a fraction of a muffin, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So each person will have 3 muffins.

First, we need to determine the total number of people who will be sharing the muffins. Jessie invited 4 friends over, and she herself is included, making a total of 5 people (Jessie + 4 friends).

Next, we need to divide the 20 muffins equally among these 5 people. To find out how many muffins each person will have, we divide the total number of muffins by the total number of people:
\[ \text{Number of muffins per person} = \frac{20 \text{ muffins}}{5 \text{ people}} \]
