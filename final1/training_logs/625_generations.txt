system
To find the cost of 4 chairs, we first need to calculate the cost of a single chair. Given that a chair costs \( \frac{1}{7} \) of the cost of a table, and knowing the table costs $140, we can calculate the cost of a chair as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a chair} = \frac{1}{7} \times 140 = \frac{140}{7} = 20 \]

So, each chair costs $20.

Now, to find the total cost of buying one table and four chairs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the table} + \text{Cost of 4 chairs} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 140 + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 140 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 220 \]

Therefore, the total cost to buy a table and 4 chairs is $220.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one chair. We know that a chair costs 1/7 of the cost of a table.

Given that a table costs $140, the cost of one chair would be:

\[ \text{Cost of one chair} = \frac{1}{7} \times 140 = 20 \]

So, one chair costs $20.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 chairs:

\[ \text{Total cost of 4 chairs} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Now, since we need to find the total cost to buy one table and 4 chairs, we add the cost of the table and the cost of the 4 chairs together:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of one table} + \text{Total cost of 4 chairs} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 140 + 80 = 220 \]

So, the total cost to buy a table and 4 chairs is $220.

To find the total cost of the table and 4 chairs, we first need to determine the cost of one chair.

Given:
- The cost of the table = $140
- The cost of a chair is 1/7 of the cost of a table

Calculate the cost of one chair:
\[ \text{Cost of one chair} = \frac{1}{7} \times 140 = 20 \]

Now, calculate the cost of 4 chairs:
\[ \text{Cost of 4 chairs} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Finally, calculate the total cost for the table and 4 chairs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of table} + \text{Cost of 4 chairs} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 140 + 80 = 220 \]

Thus, the total cost to buy a table and 4 chairs will be $220.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know the cost of a table is $140.

2. The cost of a chair is 1/7 of the cost of a table. So, the cost of a chair is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a chair} = \frac{1}{7} \times 140 = 20
   \]

3. We need to find the total cost for a table and 4 chairs:
   - Cost of 4 chairs:
     \[
     4 \times 20 = 80
     \]
   - Cost of a table:
     \[
     140
     \]

4. Adding these together gives the total cost:
   \[
   80 + 140 = 220
   \]

So, the total cost to buy a table and 4 chairs is $220.

To find the cost per chair, we take one seventh of the cost of a table. Since the table costs $140, the cost per chair is:

\[ \frac{140}{7} = \$20 \text{ per chair} \]

Next, to find the total cost for 4 chairs, we multiply the cost per chair by 4:

\[ 4 \times 20 = \$80 \]

Adding the cost of the table to the total cost of the chairs gives us the final amount:

\[ \text{Cost of table} + \text{Total cost of chairs} = \$140 + \$80 = \$220 \]

Therefore, the total cost to buy a table and 4 chairs is \$220.

Let's break this down:

1. The cost of a chair is 1/7 of the cost of a table. 
   - So, the cost of one chair = 1/7 * $140
   - This equals $20

2. The table costs $140, and we have to buy 1 table.
   - So, the total cost for the table = $140

3. For 4 chairs, we'll add the cost of the table to the cost of 4 chairs.
   - The cost of 4 chairs = 4 * $20
   - This equals $80

4. Adding the table and chairs together:
   - Total cost = $140 (table) + $80 (4 chairs)
   - This equals $220

To find the cost of one chair, we divide the cost of the table by 7: $140 รท 7 = $20.

To find the cost of 4 chairs, we multiply the cost of one chair by 4: $20 ร 4 = $80.

To find the total cost of a table and 4 chairs, we add the cost of the table to the cost of the chairs: $140 + $80 = $220.

Let's denote the cost of a table by \( T \) and the cost of a chair by \( C \). We are given that \( T = \$140 \) and \( C = \frac{1}{7}T \).

First, we calculate the cost of a chair:
\[ C = \frac{1}{7} \times 140 = 20 \]

So, each chair costs $20. Now, we need to find the total cost to buy one table and four chairs.

The total cost for one table and four chairs is:
\[ T + 4C = 140 + 4 \times 20 = 140 + 80 = 220 \]

Therefore, the total cost to buy one table and four chairs is \$220.
