To determine the total cost of Hilary's meal at Delicious Delhi, we first calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs, including the tip.

1. **Samosas Cost**:
   - Hilary bought 3 samosas at $2 each.
   - Total cost of samosas = 3 samosas * $2/samosa = $6.

2. **Pakoras Cost**:
   - Hilary bought 4 orders of pakoras at $3 each.
   - Total cost of pakoras = 4 pakoras * $3/pakora = $12.

3. **Mango Lassi Cost**:
   - Hilary bought 1 mango lassi at $2.
   - Total cost of mango lassi = 1 mango lassi * $2/mango lassi = $2.

Next, we sum the individual costs to find the total cost before the tip:
   - Total cost before tip = $6 (samosas) + $12 (pakoras) + $2 (mango lassi) = $20.

Then, we calculate the tip. The tip is 25% of the total cost before tip:
   - Tip amount = 0.25 * $20 = $5.

Finally, we add the tip to the total cost before the tip to find the total cost of the meal:
   - Total cost of the meal with tip = $20 + $5 = $25.

Therefore, the total cost of Hilary's meal with tax is $25.

To calculate the total cost of Hilary's meal, we need to consider the cost of each item she bought and then apply the 25% tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the samosas:
- Each samosa costs $2
- Hilary bought 3 samosas
- Total cost for samosas = 3 samosas * $2/samosa = $6

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pakoras:
- Each pakora costs $3
- Hilary bought 4 pakoras
- Total cost for pakoras = 4 pakoras * $3/pakora = $12

Now, the mango lassi costs $2.

Adding it all up before the tip:
- Total food cost = $6 (samosas) + $12 (pakoras) + $2 (mango lassi) = $20

Now, to calculate the tip:
- Tip = 25% of $20 = 0.25 * $20 = $5

Finally, to calculate the total cost of the meal including the tip:
- Total cost = $20 (food cost) + $5 (tip) = $25

Therefore, the total cost of Hilary's meal, including tax, is $25.

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total cost of the meal before tax and tip.

1. Calculate the cost of the samosas:
\[ \text{Cost of samosas} = 3 \times \$2 = \$6 \]

2. Calculate the cost of the pakoras:
\[ \text{Cost of pakoras} = 4 \times \$3 = \$12 \]

3. Add the cost of the mango lassi:
\[ \text{Cost of mango lassi} = \$2 \]

Now, sum these amounts to get the total cost before tax and tip:
\[ \text{Total cost before tax and tip} = \$6 + \$12 + \$2 = \$20 \]

Next, we calculate the tip, which is 25% of the total cost before tax and tip:
\[ \text{Tip} = 0.25 \times \$20 = \$5 \]

Finally, add the tip to the total cost before tax and tip to get the final amount Hilary paid:
\[ \text{Final amount} = \$20 + \$5 = \$25 \]

To calculate the total cost of Hilary's meal, we first need to calculate the cost of the food items she bought. The samosas cost $2 each, and she bought three, so the total cost for the samosas is 2 * 3 = $6. The pakoras cost $3 each, and she bought four, so the total cost for the pakoras is 3 * 4 = $12. The mango lassi costs $2. 

Adding these amounts together, the total cost of the food items is 6 + 12 + 2 = $20. 

Next, we calculate the tip, which is 25% of the total food cost. The tip amount is 0.25 * 20 = $5. 

Finally, to find the total cost of Hilary's meal, we add the total cost of the food items and the tip, giving a total of 20 + 5 = $25. We must also add the tax, which was not specified in the question, so it is not included in the calculation.

To determine the total cost of Hilary's meal at Delicious Delhi, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost of the samosas: 3 samosas at $2 each will cost 3 * $2 = $6.
2. The cost of the pakoras: 4 orders of pakoras at $3 each will cost 4 * $3 = $12.
3. The cost of the mango lassi: $2.

Adding these amounts together gives us the subtotal before tip.
Subtotal = $6 + $12 + $2 = $20.

To calculate the tip, we need to find 25% of the subtotal.
Tip = 0.25 * $20 = $5.

The total cost before tax is the subtotal plus the tip.
Total before tax = $20 + $5 = $25.

Since there is no mention of tax, we assume that the total cost of the meal is $25.

To determine the total cost of Hilary's meal at Delicious Delhi restaurant, we need to calculate the cost of each item, then sum these costs, and finally add a 25% tip.

1. **Cost of samosas:**
   Hilary bought 3 samosas at $2 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of samosas} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of pakoras:**
   Hilary bought 4 orders of pakoras at $3 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pakoras} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of mango lassi:**
   Hilary bought 1 mango lassi for $2.
   \[
   \text{Cost of mango lassi} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total cost before tip:**
   Sum the costs of the items.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before tip} = 6 + 12 + 2 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the tip:**
   Hilary left a 25% tip on the total cost before tip.
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 0.25 \times 20 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total cost including tip:**
   Add the tip to the total cost before tip.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of the meal Hilary paid, including a 25% tip, is $25.

- Hilary bought 3 samosas at $2 each, so the cost is \( 3 \times 2 = \$6 \).
- She bought 4 orders of pakoras at $3 each, so the cost is \( 4 \times 3 = \$12 \).

Next, calculate the cost of the mango lassi:
- The mango lassi costs $2.

Now, sum up the costs of all items:
- Samosas: $6
- Pakoras: $12
- Mango lassi: $2

Add these costs to find the total meal cost before the tip:
- Total cost before tip = $6 (samosas) + $12 (pakoras) + $2 (mango lassi) = $20.

To calculate the tip, which is 25% of the total cost:
- Tip = 0.25 \times 20 = $5.

Now, add the tip to the total cost before the tip to find the final cost:
- Final cost = Total cost before tip + Tip = $20 + $5 = $25.

First, we calculate the cost of the samosas and pakoras:
- Hilary bought three samosas at $2 each, so the cost for the samosas is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
- She bought four orders of pakoras at $3 each, so the cost for the pakoras is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) dollars.
- She also bought a mango lassi for $2.

Next, we sum up the costs of all these items:
- Total cost of samosas and pakoras: \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
- Adding the cost of the mango lassi: \(18 + 2 = 20\) dollars.

Hilary wanted to leave a 25% tip on her total bill. To find the tip amount, we calculate 25% of $20:
- Tip: \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

The total cost of the meal, including the tip, is the sum of the total bill and the tip:
- Total cost including tip: \(20 + 5 = 25\) dollars.
