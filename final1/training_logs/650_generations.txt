<reasoning>
To calculate the total number of pennies Roshesmina has, we need to first determine the initial number of pennies in the piggy bank. Since there are two pennies in each of the twelve compartments, the initial number of pennies is 2 * 12 = 24 pennies. After adding 6 more pennies to each compartment, the new number of pennies in each compartment becomes 2 + 6 = 8 pennies. Therefore, the total number of pennies in the piggy bank is now 8 * 12. 

To find the total number of pennies, we can calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Total pennies} = 24 + (12 \times 6) \]

<reasoning>
Initially, in each compartment, there are 2 pennies. There are 12 compartments. So, the total pennies in the compartments without any addition is $2 \times 12 = 24$ pennies. Roshesmina adds 6 more pennies to each compartment, which means for each compartment, the total pennies become $2 + 6 = 8$ pennies. Since there are 12 compartments, the total additional pennies added to the piggy bank is $8 \times 12$. Therefore, the total number of pennies she has is the sum of the initial pennies and the additional pennies.

So, the total number of pennies is $24 + 8 \times 12$.
</reasoning>
<answer>
24 + 8 \times 12 = 24 + 96 = 120
</answer>
The answer is 120.

To determine the total number of pennies Roshesmina has, we start by calculating the initial number of pennies in her piggy bank. Since there are two pennies in each of the twelve compartments, the initial number of pennies is given by:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, she adds 6 more pennies to each of the twelve compartments. Therefore, the additional number of pennies added is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \]

To find the total number of pennies after adding the new ones, we add the initial number of pennies to the additional pennies:
\[ 24 + 72 = 96 \]

So, the total number of pennies Roshesmina has is 96.

To calculate the total number of pennies, we need to consider both the initial amount and the additional pennies added.

Step 1: Calculate the initial total number of pennies.
There are 12 compartments, and each compartment contains 2 pennies.
\[ 12 \text{ compartments} \times 2 \text{ pennies per compartment} = 24 \text{ pennies} \]

Step 2: Calculate the additional total number of pennies.
There are 6 more pennies added to each compartment.
\[ 12 \text{ compartments} \times 6 \text{ pennies per compartment} = 72 \text{ pennies} \]

Step 3: Add the initial number of pennies to the additional number of pennies.
\[ 24 \text{ pennies} + 72 \text{ pennies} = 96 \text{ pennies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pennies Roshesmina has is 96.

To determine the total number of pennies Roshesmina has after adding more to each compartment, we can break this down into a few steps:

1. First, calculate the number of pennies in the original compartments.
2. Next, calculate the number of additional pennies added.
3. Finally, sum the original pennies and the added pennies to get the total.

From the information given:
- There are 12 compartments.
- Each compartment originally has 2 pennies.
- She adds 6 more pennies to each compartment.

First, we find the total number of original pennies:
\[ 12 \text{ compartments} \times 2 \text{ pennies per compartment} = 24 \text{ original pennies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of additional pennies added:
\[ 12 \text{ compartments} \times 6 \text{ additional pennies per compartment} = 72 \text{ additional pennies} \]

Now, we sum the original pennies and the additional pennies to get the total:
\[ 24 \text{ original pennies} + 72 \text{ additional pennies} = 96 \text{ pennies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pennies Roshesmina has is 96.

To calculate the total number of pennies Roshesmina has, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pennies in one compartment before adding more:
   There are 2 pennies in each compartment.

2. Add the additional pennies to each compartment:
   She adds 6 more pennies to each of the 12 compartments, but since the question asks for the total after adding, we do not need to calculate this.

3. Calculate the total number of pennies in all compartments after adding:
   Each of the 12 compartments now contains (2 + 6) pennies.
   So, the total number of pennies in all compartments is:
   \( 12 \text{ compartments} \times 8 \text{ pennies per compartment} = 96 \text{ pennies} \).

Therefore, the total number of pennies she has is 96.

Roshesmina starts with 2 pennies in each of the 12 compartments. This means she initially has \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pennies. If she adds 6 more pennies to each compartment, then each compartment receives \(2 + 6 = 8\) pennies. With 12 compartments, the total addition is \(8 \times 12 = 96\) pennies. Therefore, the total number of pennies she has now is \(24 + 96 = 120\).

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial number of pennies in the piggy bank. Since there are two pennies in each of the twelve compartments, we can calculate the initial number of pennies as follows:

\[ \text{Total initial pennies} = 2 \times 12 \]

After adding 6 more pennies to each compartment, we multiply the new number of pennies in each compartment by the number of compartments:

\[ \text{New total pennies per compartment} = 2 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total new pennies} = (\text{New total pennies per compartment}) \times 12 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pennies after the addition.

Initially, Roshesmina has 2 pennies in each of the 12 compartments, so the initial number of pennies is \(2 \times 12 = 24\).

If she adds 6 more pennies to each compartment, then each compartment will have \(2 + 6 = 8\) pennies.

The total number of pennies in all compartments after adding the extra pennies is \(8 \times 12 = 96\).

Thus, the total number of pennies she has is 96.

Initially, Roshesmina has two pennies in each of the twelve compartments. This means she has a total of \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pennies. After adding 6 more pennies to each compartment, the number of pennies in each compartment becomes \(2 + 6 = 8\). Therefore, the total number of pennies in the piggy bank now is \(12 \times 8 = 96\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pennies if she adds 6 more pennies to each compartment, but this time let's account for the initial addition correctly: Initially, \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pennies. After adding 6 more pennies to each compartment from the new total, the number of pennies in each compartment becomes \(2 + 6 = 8\). So, the total now is \(12 \times 8 = 96\).

Since the problem does not specify a different addition, we will use the initial calculation which assumes no further additions are made.
