#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
<reasoning>
Winston started with 14 quarters, which is equivalent to $3.50 (since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 14 quarters would be 350 cents, and 350 cents divided by 100 cents per dollar gives $3.50).

He then spends half a dollar on candy, which is 50 cents. To find out how many cents he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the original amount in cents: \(350 - 50 = 300\) cents.

Therefore, Winston has 300 cents left.

<reasoning>
To determine how many cents Winston has left after spending half a dollar on candy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total value of the quarters in cents. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of 14 quarters is:
   \[
   14 \times 25 = 350 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. Determine the cost of the candy. Half a dollar is equivalent to 50 cents.

3. Subtract the cost of the candy from the total value of the quarters to find out how much money Winston has left:
   \[
   350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, Winston has 300 cents left.

First, we need to determine how much money Winston has in cents. Since there are 25 cents in a quarter, Winston has \(14 \times 25 = 350\) cents.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Winston spends on candy. Since he spends half a dollar, we convert half a dollar to cents: \(0.5 \times 100 = 50\) cents.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on candy from the total amount of money Winston had initially: \(350 - 50 = 300\) cents.

Therefore, Winston has 300 cents left.

First, we need to determine how many cents Winston has initially. Since he has 14 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, we calculate the total number of cents as follows:
\[ 14 \times 25 = 350 \text{ cents} \]

Next, Winston spends half a dollar on candy. Since half a dollar equals 50 cents (as 1 dollar is 100 cents), we subtract this amount from the initial total:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, Winston has 300 cents left.

Winston starts with 14 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so with 14 quarters, he has \( 14 \times 25 = 350 \) cents.

He spends half a dollar on candy. Since half a dollar is equivalent to 50 cents, he spends 50 cents on candy.

To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent on candy from the initial amount:
\( 350 - 50 = 300 \)

So, Winston has 300 cents left.

<reasoning>
To determine how many cents Winston has left, we first need to convert all his currency into cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, half a dollar is 50 cents.

Next, we calculate the value of 14 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 14 quarters amount to \( 14 \times 25 = 350 \) cents.

Subtracting the 50 cents spent on candy from the 350 cents he had initially gives us \( 350 - 50 = 300 \) cents.

Therefore, Winston has 300 cents left.

To determine how many cents Winston has left after spending half a dollar on candy, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total value of Winston's quarters in cents. Since there are 4 quarters in a dollar and each quarter is worth 25 cents, 14 quarters are worth \( 14 \times 25 = 350 \) cents.
2. Next, calculate the value of half a dollar in cents. Since half a dollar is worth 50 cents, the value in cents is 50 cents.
3. To find out how much money Winston has left after spending half a dollar on candy, subtract the 50 cents spent from the initial 350 cents:
   \[
   350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, Winston has 300 cents left.

To determine how many cents Winston has left, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount in cents:** 
   - Winston has 14 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - Therefore, 14 quarters * 25 cents per quarter = 350 cents.

2. **Determine the cost of the candy:**
   - Winston spends half a dollar, which is equivalent to 50 cents.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount:**
   - Subtract the cost of the candy from the total amount.
   - 350 cents - 50 cents = 300 cents.

Therefore, Winston has 300 cents left.

To solve this problem, we need to know the value of a quarter and half a dollar in cents.

1 quarter is equal to \(25\) cents.
1 dollar is equal to \(100\) cents, so half a dollar is \(50\) cents.

Winston starts with \(14 \times 25 = 350\) cents.
He spends \(50\) cents on candy.

So, the amount of money he has left will be \(350 - 50 = 300\) cents.

Therefore, Winston has \(300\) cents left.

<reasoning>
Winston has 14 quarters, each worth 25 cents. So, the total value of his quarters is \( 14 \times 25 = 350 \) cents. He spends half a dollar on candy, which is \( 50 \times \frac{1}{2} = 25 \) cents. To find out how many cents he has left, we subtract the cost of the candy from the total value of his quarters: \( 350 - 25 = 325 \) cents.

However, the problem specifies "half a dollar" for candy, which is indeed \( 50 \) cents, not half of a dollar. Therefore, the calculation remains the same if we correct the confusion about what "half a dollar" refers to. 

So, the correct calculation should be:
\( 350 \) cents (total value of quarters) - \( 50 \) cents (value of candy) = \( 300 \) cents.

This aligns with the logic of the problem, but the interpretation of "half a dollar" directly should be \( 50 \) cents. Thus, the correct total value of quarters is \( 300 \) cents.

Winston has 14 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value in cents of the quarters is:
\[ 14 \times 25 = 350 \text{ cents} \]

He spends half a dollar on candy. Since half a dollar is equal to 50 cents, the amount spent on candy is:
\[ 50 \text{ cents} \]

The amount of cents he has left is the total value of the quarters minus the amount spent on candy:
\[ 350 \text{ cents} - 50 \text{ cents} = 300 \text{ cents} \]

So, the number of cents he has left is 300.

First, we need to determine how many cents Winston has in his 14 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 14 quarters will give Winston \(14 \times 25 = 350\) cents.

Next, we calculate how much money Winston spends on candy. Since he spends half a dollar on candy, \(0.50\) dollars is equal to \(50\) cents. 

To find out how much money Winston has left, we subtract the amount he spent on candy from the amount he had initially. So, \(350 - 50 = 300\) cents.

Therefore, Winston has 300 cents left.
