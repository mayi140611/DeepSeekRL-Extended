To calculate the total distance covered, we need to break down the problem into two parts and calculate the distance travelled in each part.

1. Swimming:

For swimming, we know the time and speed. So, we can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time, which gives:

\(Distance_{swim} = 2 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours}\)

\(Distance_{swim} = 4 \text{ miles}\)

2. Running:

For running, the time is half of the swimming time, which is \(1 \text{ hour}\). The speed is \(4\) times the swimming speed, which is \(4 \times 2 \text{ miles/hour} = 8 \text{ miles/hour}\). So, running distance is calculated by:

\(Distance_{run} = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour}\)

\(Distance_{run} = 8 \text{ miles}\)

Now, summing up the distances from both the swimming and running parts:

\(Total \text{ distance} = Distance_{swim} + Distance_{run}\)

\(Total \text{ distance} = 4 \text{ miles} + 8 \text{ miles}\)

\(Total \text{ distance} = 12 \text{ miles}\)

First, we need to calculate the distance Tom swims. The formula for distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the swimming portion:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{swim}} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ miles per hour} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time Tom runs. Since he runs for half the time he swims:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{run}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

And since he runs at 4 times his swimming speed:
\[ \text{Speed}_{\text{run}} = 4 \times 2 \text{ miles per hour} = 8 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now we calculate the distance Tom runs:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{run}} = 1 \text{ hour} \times 8 \text{ miles per hour} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{swim}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{run}} = 4 \text{ miles} + 8 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom covers is 12 miles.

First, we calculate the distance Tom swims. He swims for 2 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour. So, the distance he covers while swimming is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ miles/hour} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time he runs. The problem states that he runs for half the time he swims. Therefore, the time he runs is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Then, we calculate his running speed, which is 4 times the speed at which he swims. So:
\[ 4 \times 2 \text{ miles/hour} = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Finally, we calculate the distance he covers while running. Since he runs for 1 hour at a speed of 8 miles per hour, the distance he covers while running is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} \times 8 \text{ miles/hour} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Adding up the distances from swimming and running, we get:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} + 8 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom covers is 12 miles.

First, let's calculate the distance covered by Tom while swimming. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For swimming:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{swim}} = 2 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance covered while running. Tom runs for half the time he swam, which is 1 hour, and at a speed that is 4 times his swimming speed. 

\[ \text{Speed}_{\text{run}} = 2 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \]

The distance covered while running:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{run}} = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance covered is the sum of the distances covered while swimming and running:

1. First, calculate the distance Tom swims. He swims for 2 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour, so the distance he swims is \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ miles/hour} = 4 \text{ miles} \).

2. Next, calculate the distance Tom runs. He runs for half the time he swims, which is \( 2 \text{ hours} / 2 = 1 \text{ hour} \), and the speed at which he runs is 4 times the speed he swims. So, his running speed is \( 2 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \). Therefore, the distance he runs is \( 1 \text{ hour} \times 8 \text{ miles/hour} = 8 \text{ miles} \).

3. The total distance Tom covers is the sum of the distance he swims and the distance he runs, which is \( 4 \text{ miles} + 8 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

To determine the total distance Tom covered, we need to calculate the distance he swam and the distance he ran separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Distance Swam:**
   - Tom swims for 2 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time

   Therefore, the distance covered while swimming is:
   \[ \text{Distance Swam} = 2 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

2. **Distance Ran:**
   - Tom runs for half the time he swims, which is:
   \[ \frac{2 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

   - The speed while running is 4 times the swimming speed, which is:
   \[ 4 \text{ mph} \]

   - The distance covered while running is:
   \[ \text{Distance Ran} = 4 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Adding the distances covered while swimming and running:
   \[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance Swam} + \text{Distance Ran} = 4 \text{ miles} + 4 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To calculate the total distance Tom covered, we'll need to calculate the distance he swam and then the distance he ran.

First, we'll calculate the distance Tom swam:
Distance = Speed * Time
Tom swam for 2 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour, so:
Distance_Swum = 2 miles/hour * 2 hours = 4 miles

Next, we'll calculate the distance Tom ran:
- The time he ran is half the time he swam, so:
   Time_Running = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour
- He ran at 4 times the speed, so his speed was:
   Speed_Running = 4 * 2 miles/hour = 8 miles per hour

Distance_Run = Speed_Running * Time_Running
          = 8 miles/hour * 1 hour
          = 8 miles

Now, we add the distance he swam and the distance he ran to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance_Swum + Distance_Run
              = 4 miles + 8 miles
              = 12 miles

So, Tom's total distance covered is 12 miles.

First, let's calculate the distance he swam. The formula to calculate distance is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
Tom swims for 2 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he swam is:
\[
\text{Distance Swam} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ miles/hour} = 4 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the time Tom runs. He runs for half the time he swam, so he runs for:
\[
\text{Time Running} = \frac{2 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Now, let's calculate the speed Tom runs at. His running speed is 4 times the swimming speed, so:
\[
\text{Speed Running} = 4 \times 2 \text{ miles/hour} = 8 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Using the distance formula again, we can find the distance Tom runs:
\[
\text{Distance Running} = \text{Speed Running} \times \text{Time Running} = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 8 \text{ miles}
\]

Finally, to find the total distance Tom covered, we sum the distance he swam and the distance he ran:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance Swam} + \text{Distance Running} = 4 \text{ miles} + 8 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total distance Tom covered is:
\[
12 \text{ miles}

- The speed for running is 4 times the speed of swimming, so:
\[ \text{Speed running} = 4 \times 2 \text{ miles per hour} = 8 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The distance covered running is:

\[ \text{Distance running} = 8 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance running} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Total distance} = 4 \text{ miles} + 8 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom covered is 12 miles.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom swims. Since he swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour for 2 hours, the distance he swims is given by:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_swimming = 2 miles/hour × 2 hours = 4 miles

Next, we calculate the time Tom spends running. Since he runs for half the time he swam, he runs for:

Time_running = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour

The speed of running is 4 times the speed of swimming, so:

Speed_running = 4 × 2 miles/hour = 8 miles/hour

Now, we calculate the distance Tom runs using the running speed and time:

Distance_running = Speed_running × Time_running
Distance_running = 8 miles/hour × 1 hour = 8 miles

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance Tom covers:

Total_distance = Distance_swimming + Distance_running
Total_distance = 4 miles + 8 miles = 12 miles

To determine the total distance Tom covers, we need to calculate the distance he swims and the distance he runs separately, and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance Tom swims:
- He swims for 2 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
- The distance covered by swimming is given by the formula: Distance = Speed × Time.
- Therefore, the distance covered by swimming is \(2 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we calculate the time Tom runs:
- He runs for half the time he swims, so he runs for \( \frac{2 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1 \text{ hour}\).

Now, we calculate the distance Tom runs:
- The speed at which he runs is 4 times his swimming speed, so the speed during running is \(4 \times 2 \text{ mph} = 8 \text{ mph}\).
- The distance covered by running is given by the formula: Distance = Speed × Time.
- Therefore, the distance covered by running is \(8 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 8 \text{ miles}\).

Finally, we sum the distances covered by swimming and running:
- The total distance covered is \(4 \text{ miles} + 8 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}\).
