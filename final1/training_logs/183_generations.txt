###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A small poultry farm has 300 chickens, 200 turkeys and 80 guinea fowls. A strange, incurable disease hit the farm and every day the farmer lost 20 chickens, 8 turkeys and 5 guinea fowls. After a week, how many birds will be left in the poultry?

system
Let's calculate the reduction in each type of bird:

- Chickens: 300 - (20 * 7) = 300 - 140 = 160
- Turkeys: 200 - (8 * 7) = 200 - 56 = 144
- Guinea fowls: 80 - (5 * 7) = 80 - 35 = 45

Now we add them up:

160 (chickens) + 144 (turkeys) + 45 (guinea fowls) = 349

The total number of birds left is 349.

The number of chickens lost in a week is 20 x 7 = 140.
Thus, the remaining number of chickens is 300 - 140 = 160.
The number of turkeys lost in a week is 8 x 7 = 56.
Thus, the remaining number of turkeys is 200 - 56 = 144.
The number of guinea fowls lost in a week is 5 x 7 = 35.
Thus, the remaining number of guinea fowls is 80 - 35 = 45.

Therefore, the answer is 160 birds.

In a single day, the farm lost \( 20 + 8 + 5 = 33 \) birds.
After a week, the farmers will have lost \( 33 \times 7 = 231 \) birds in total. Thus, there will be a total of \( 300 + 200 + 80 - 231 = 249 \) birds left in the poultry.

In one day, the farmer loses a total of 20 + 8 + 5 = 33 birds.
After a week, a total of 33 x 7 = 231 birds will be lost.
The poultry will have 300 + 200 + 80 â€“ 231 = 249 birds left.

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####

system
The farmer loses: 20 chickens per day * 7 days = 140 chickens
The farmer loses: 8 turkeys per day * 7 days = 56 turkeys
The farmer loses: 5 guinea fowls per day * 7 days = 35 guinea fowls
The total amount of birds left is: 300 chickens - 140 chickens = 160 chickens
The total amount of birds left is: 200 turkeys - 56 turkeys = 144 turkeys
The total amount of birds left is: 80 guinea fowls - 35 guinea fowls = 45 guinea fowls.
Therefore, there will be: 160 chickens + 144 turkeys + 45 guinea fowls = 349 birds.

Every day, the number of chickens, turkeys and guinea fowls decrease by 20, 8 and 5 respectively.

So after 7 days, the number of chickens left will be: 300-20*7 = 140
The number of turkeys left will be: 200 - 8*7 = 96 
And the number of guinea fowls left will be: 80 - 5*7 = 40

So the total number of birds left will be 140+96+40 = 276

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####

system
The farmer loses 300 chickens in a week, 20/7 = 2 chickens per day.
So, the total number of chickens lost in a week is 2*7 = 14.

The farmer loses 80 turkeys in a week, 8/7 = 1 turkey per day.
So, the total number of turkeys lost in a week is 1*7 = 7.

The farmer loses 5 guinea fowls in a week, 5/7 = 5/7.

300-7 = 293 are left.
200-5 = 195 are left.
80-2 = 78 are left.

Total number of birds left = 293+195+78= 566.

Every day, the chicken population decreases by 20 * 300 = 600. The turkey population decreases by 8 * 200 = 1600. The guinea fowl population decreases by 5 * 80 = 400. After a week, the number of the chickens left will be 300 - 600 = -300. The number of the turkeys left will be 200 - 1600 = -1400. And the number of the guinea fowl left will be 80 - 400 = -320. Therefore, the total number of the birds left is -300 + (-1400) + (-320) = -2020.

Every day, the farmer loses:
20 chickens - 8 turkeys - 5 guinea fowls = 7 birds
In a week (7 days), the total birds lost will be:
7 birds/day * 7 days/week = 49 birds
Now let's calculate how many birds remain:
Chickens:   300 - 49 = 251
Turkeys:     200 - 49 = 151
Guinea fowls: 80 - 49 = 31

Total remaining birds = 251 + 151 + 31 = 433
