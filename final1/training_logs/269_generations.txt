system
On Saturday, John earned $18.
On Sunday, he earned half of that, which is $18/2 = $9.
So, for the current weekend, he earned a total of $18 + $9 = $27.
The previous weekend, he had already earned $20, so in total, he had earned $20 + $27 = $47.
He needs $60 to buy a new pogo stick, so he still needs $60 - $47 = $13 more.

John's earnings are as follows:
- Saturday: $18
- Sunday: half of Saturday's earnings, which is $18/2 = $9
- Previous weekend: $20

His total earnings so far: $18 (Saturday) + $9 (Sunday) + $20 (previous weekend) = $47

He needs $60 to buy a new pogo stick, so the additional amount he needs to earn is: $60 - $47 = $13

On Sunday, John earned half of what he earned on Saturday, which is \(18 / 2 = 9\) dollars. Adding the earnings from both weekends, he earned \(18 + 9 + 20 = 47\) dollars in total. To find out how much more money he needs to earn to buy a new pogo stick priced at $60, we calculate the difference between $60 and his total earnings: \(60 - 47 = 13\) dollars.
