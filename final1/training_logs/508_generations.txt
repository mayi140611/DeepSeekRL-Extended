#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To calculate the electricity cost, we first need to determine the total energy consumption of the oven, which is given in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

Total consumption = Consumption rate × Usage time
Total consumption = 2.4 kWh/kw × 25 hours
Total consumption = 60 kWh

Now, we can calculate the cost of this energy consumption at the given price of $0.10 per kWh.

Cost = Total consumption × Price per kWh
Cost = 60 kWh × $0.10/kWh
Cost = $6.00

Therefore, Coco will pay $6.00 for using his oven for 25 hours last month.

To determine how much Coco will pay for using his oven, we need to calculate the total energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and then multiply it by the electricity price per kilowatt-hour.

1. Calculate the total energy consumption in kWh:
\[ \text{Total Energy Consumption} = \text{Energy Consumption Rate} \times \text{Use Time} \]
\[ \text{Total Energy Consumption} = 2.4 \, \text{kWh} \times 25 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Total Energy Consumption} = 60 \, \text{kWh} \]

2. Calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Energy Consumption} \times \text{Electricity Price} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 60 \, \text{kWh} \times $0.10 \, \text{per kWh} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = $6.00 \]

To determine how much Coco will pay for using his oven, we first need to calculate the total energy consumption of the oven over the period it was used.

The oven has a consumption rate of 2.4 kWh per hour. If it was used for a total of 25 hours last month, the total energy consumption can be calculated as follows:
\[ 2.4 \text{ kWh/hour} \times 25 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ kWh} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of using 60 kWh at the rate of $0.10 per kWh:
\[ 60 \text{ kWh} \times \$0.10/\text{kWh} = \$6.00 \]

Therefore, Coco will pay $6.00 for using his oven for 25 hours.

To calculate the cost of Coco's oven usage, we first need to determine the total energy consumption.

Given that the oven consumes 2.4 kWh per hour and Coco used it for 25 hours, the total energy consumption can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Total Energy Consumption} = \text{Hourly Consumption} \times \text{Number of Hours} = 2.4 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 25 \, \text{hours} \]

\[ \text{Total Energy Consumption} = 60 \, \text{kWh} \]

Now, to find the total cost, we multiply the total energy consumption by the cost per kWh:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Energy Consumption} \times \text{Cost per kWh} = 60 \, \text{kWh} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/kWh} \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]
