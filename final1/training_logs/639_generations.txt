###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Veronica's flashlight was bright enough to be seen at night from a distance of 1000 feet.  Freddie's flashlight could be seen at night for a distance three times farther than Veronica's flashlight, and Velma's flashlight could be seen at night from a distance 2000 feet less than 5 times farther than Freddie's flashlight.  If Veronica's and Velma's flashlight were placed next to one another and turned on at night, how much farther, in feet, could Velma's flashlight be seen compared to Veronica's?

Let's start by calculating the distance that Freddie's flashlight could be seen. Since Freddie's flashlight can be seen for a distance three times farther than Veronica's flashlight, which is 1000 feet, we have:

\[
\text{Distance Freddie's flashlight can be seen} = 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance that Velma's flashlight can be seen. Velma's flashlight can be seen from a distance that is 2000 feet less than 5 times the distance Freddie's flashlight can be seen. So, we have:

\[
\text{Distance Velma's flashlight can be seen} = 5 \times 3000 - 2000 = 15000 - 2000 = 13000 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Velma's flashlight can be seen compared to Veronica's. Therefore, we subtract the distance Veronica's flashlight can be seen from the distance Velma's flashlight can be seen:

\[
13000 - 1000 = 12000 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Velma's flashlight can be seen 12000 feet farther than Veronica's flashlight.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the visibility range for each person's flashlight:

1. **Veronica's flashlight**: Its range is given as 1000 feet.
2. **Freddie's flashlight**: Its range is 3 times that of Veronica's, so \(3 \times 1000 = 3000\) feet.
3. **Velma's flashlight**: Its range is 2000 feet less than 5 times the distance Freddie's flashlight can see, so \(5 \times 3000 = 15000\) feet, and then \(15000 - 2000 = 13000\) feet.

Now we have the visible ranges for each person's flashlight:
- Veronica's flashlight: 1000 feet.
- Velma's flashlight: 13000 feet.

We need to find how much farther Velma's flashlight can be seen compared to Veronica's:
\[ 13000 - 1000 = 12000 \]

Therefore, Velma's flashlight can be seen 12000 feet farther than Veronica's flashlight.

Let's start by determining the visibility distance for each person's flashlight:

1. Veronica's flashlight: 1000 feet.

2. Freddie's flashlight: Three times farther than Veronica's, so \( 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \) feet.

3. Velma's flashlight: Two thousand feet less than five times the distance Freddie's flashlight can be seen. So, five times the distance Freddie's flashlight can be seen is \( 5 \times 3000 = 15000 \) feet, and two thousand feet less than that is \( 15000 - 2000 = 13000 \) feet.

Now, we can compare the visibility distances:

- Veronica's flashlight can be seen up to 1000 feet.
- Velma's flashlight can be seen up to 13000 feet.

To find out how much farther Velma's flashlight can be seen compared to Veronica's:

\( 13000 - 1000 = 12000 \) feet.

So, Velma's flashlight can be seen 12000 feet farther than Veronica's.

To solve this problem, let's break it into steps:

1. Veronica's flashlight can be seen at 1000 feet.
2. Freddie's flashlight can be seen from three times the distance of Veronica's, so it can be seen at \(3 \times 1000 = 3000\) feet.
3. Velma's flashlight can be seen from a distance 2000 feet less than 5 times the distance of Freddie's flashlight. First, we calculate 5 times the distance of Freddie's flashlight: \(5 \times 3000 = 15000\) feet. Then subtract 2000 feet: \(15000 - 2000 = 13000\) feet. So Velma's flashlight can be seen at 13000 feet.
4. Now, to find out how much farther Velma's flashlight can be seen compared to Veronica's, we subtract Veronica's distance from Velma's distance: \(13000 - 1000 = 12000\) feet.

So according to the information provided, Velma's flashlight can be seen 12000 feet farther compared to Veronica's flashlight.

1. Veronica's flashlight can be seen from a distance of 1000 feet.

2. Freddie's flashlight can be seen for a distance three times farther than Veronica's, so:
   \[ \text{Distance for Freddie’s flashlight} = 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \text{ feet} \]

3. Velma’s flashlight can be seen from a distance 2000 feet less than 5 times farther than Freddie’s flashlight. Therefore:
   \[ 5 \times (\text{distance for Freddie’s flashlight}) = 5 \times 3000 = 15000 \text{ feet} \]
   \[ \text{Distance for Velma’s flashlight} = 15000 - 2000 = 13000 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find out how much farther Velma's flashlight could be seen compared to Veronica's, we subtract Veronica's distance from Velma's distance:

Let's denote the distance at which Veronica's flashlight can be seen as \( V \). According to the problem, \( V = 1000 \) feet.

Freddie's flashlight can be seen at a distance three times farther than Veronica's, so the distance Freddie's flashlight can be seen is \( 3V \).

Velma's flashlight can be seen from a distance 2000 feet less than 5 times the distance Freddie's flashlight can be seen. So, the distance Velma's flashlight can be seen is \( 5 \times 3V - 2000 \).

Now, let's substitute \( V = 1000 \) into the distance Velma's flashlight can be seen:
\( 5 \times 3V - 2000 = 5 \times 3 \times 1000 - 2000 = 15000 - 2000 = 13000 \) feet.

To find out how much farther Velma's flashlight can be seen compared to Veronica's, we calculate the difference in distances:
\( 13000 - 1000 = 12000 \) feet.

So, Velma's flashlight can be seen 12000 feet farther than Veronica's.

2. Freddie's flashlight can be seen at night from a distance three times farther than Veronica's flashlight, which is \(3 \times 1000 = 3000\) feet.
3. Velma's flashlight can be seen at night for a distance 2000 feet less than 5 times farther than Freddie's flashlight. First, we calculate 5 times the distance Freddie's flashlight can be seen:

\[ 5 \times 3000 = 15000 \text{ feet} \]

Then, we subtract 2000 feet from this distance to find the distance Velma's flashlight can be seen:

\[ 15000 - 2000 = 13000 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the distances each flashlight can be seen from, we can compare them:

- Veronica's flashlight can be seen from 1000 feet.
- Velma's flashlight can be seen from 13000 feet.

To find out how much farther Velma's flashlight can be seen compared to Veronica's, we subtract the distance of Veronica's flashlight from the distance of Velma's flashlight:

\[ 13000 - 1000 = 12000 \text{ feet} \]

<reasoning>
Let's denote the distance that Veronica's flashlight can be seen as \( V \).
Given \( V = 1000 \) feet.

Freddie's flashlight can be seen for a distance that is three times farther than Veronica's, so we can express Freddie's flashlight visibility as \( 3V \).
This becomes \( 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \) feet.

Velma's flashlight can be seen for a distance that is 2000 feet less than 5 times farther than Freddie's flashlight. So, we calculate the visibility of Velma's flashlight as follows: \( 5 \times 3000 - 2000 \).

Calculating the above expression, we get \( 15000 - 2000 = 13000 \) feet.

To find how much farther Velma's flashlight can be seen compared to Veronica's, subtract the visibility of Veronica's flashlight from Velma's:
\[ 13000 - 1000 = 12000 \text{ feet} \]

Now, let's substitute the value of \( V \) into this to confirm \( V \):
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \text{ feet} \]

So, the difference in distance becomes \( 12000 - 6000 = 1000 \) feet, confirming our reasoning.

2. Freddie's flashlight can be seen for a distance three times farther than Veronica's, so we calculate:
   \( 1000 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 3000 \text{ feet} \)

3. Velma's flashlight can be seen for a distance 2000 feet less than 5 times farther than Freddie's flashlight. First, we calculate 5 times the distance Freddie's flashlight can be seen:
   \( 3000 \text{ feet} \times 5 = 15000 \text{ feet} \)
   Then, we subtract 2000 feet from this distance:
   \( 15000 \text{ feet} - 2000 \text{ feet} = 13000 \text{ feet} \)

Now, since Veronica's flashlight can be seen for 1000 feet and Velma's flashlight for 13,000 feet, the difference is:
\( 13000 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 12000 \text{ feet}\)

\[ \text{Distance}\_Freddie\_\text{flashlight} = 3 \times \text{Distance}\_Veronica\_\text{flashlight} = 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \text{ feet} \]
