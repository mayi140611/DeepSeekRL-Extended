There are 32 / 2 = 16 tables with 2 chairs each. So there are 16 * 2 = 32 chairs in total from the tables that accommodate 2 chairs. There is a total of 5 * 3 = 15 chairs from tables that accommodate 3 chairs. So there are 32 + 15 = 47 chairs from tables that accommodate 4 chairs. Therefore, there are a total of 47 + 16 = 63 chairs in the hall.

First, find the number of tables with 2 chairs: 32 tables / 2 = 16 tables. Then find the total chairs from the 16 tables: 16 tables * 2 chairs/tables = 32 chairs. There are 5 tables * 3 chairs/tables = 15 chairs from the 5 tables. The rest of the tables are 32 tables - 16 tables - 5 tables = 11 tables. The total chairs from the 11 tables is 11 tables * 4 chairs/tables = 44 chairs. Add up all chairs found, 32 chairs + 15 chairs + 44 chairs = 91 chairs.

Half of the tables have 2 chairs each, so that's 32/2 = 16 tables with 2 chairs each.
5 tables have 3 chairs each.
The rest of the tables have 4 chairs each. Since there are 32 tables in total, that means 32 - 16 - 5 = 11 tables have 4 chairs each.
The total number of chairs from the tables with 2 chairs each is 16 * 2 = 32 chairs.
The total number of chairs from the tables with 3 chairs each is 5 * 3 = 15 chairs.
The total number of chairs from the tables with 4 chairs each is 11 * 4 = 44 chairs.

To find the total number of chairs, add the chairs together: 32 + 15 + 44 = 91 chairs.

There are 32 tables in the hall.
Half of the tables have 2 chairs each, which is (32 / 2) = 16 tables with 2 chairs each.
5 tables have 3 chairs each.
The rest of the tables have 4 chairs each. To find out how many tables that is, we subtract the tables with 2 chairs and the tables with 3 chairs from the total tables: 32 - 16 - 5 = 11 tables with 4 chairs each.
The total number of chairs from the tables with 2 chairs each is 16 tables * 2 chairs/table = 32 chairs.
The total number of chairs from the tables with 3 chairs each is 5 tables * 3 chairs/table = 15 chairs.
The total number of chairs from the tables with 4 chairs each is 11 tables * 4 chairs/table = 44 chairs.
So, the total number of chairs in the hall is 32 + 15 + 44 = 91 chairs.

The hall has 32 tables in total. Half of these tables, which is 32 / 2 = 16 tables, have 2 chairs each. The total number of chairs from these tables is 16 tables * 2 chairs/table = 32 chairs.

There are 5 tables that have 3 chairs each, so the total number of chairs from these tables is 5 tables * 3 chairs/table = 15 chairs.

The remaining tables are 32 tables total minus the 16 tables that have 2 chairs each and the 5 tables that have 3 chairs each, which equals 32 - 16 - 5 = 11 tables. The total number of chairs from these 11 tables is 11 tables * 4 chairs/table = 44 chairs.

Adding them all together, the total number of chairs in the hall is 32 + 15 + 44 = 91 chairs.
