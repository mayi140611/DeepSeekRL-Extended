system
To determine how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of oil in the 10 cans that each hold 8 liters.
   \[
   10 \text{ cans} \times 8 \text{ liters/can} = 80 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. Subtract the total amount of oil in the 10 cans from the total amount of oil in all 24 cans to find out how much oil is in the remaining 14 cans.
   \[
   290 \text{ liters} - 80 \text{ liters} = 210 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. Divide the remaining amount of oil by the number of the remaining cans to find out how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding.
   \[
   \frac{210 \text{ liters}}{14 \text{ cans}} = 15 \text{ liters/can}
   \]

Therefore, each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil.

<reasoning>
First, let's determine the total amount of oil in the 10 cans that are holding 8 liters each. This can be calculated as:

\( 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ liters} \)

Now, let's subtract this amount from the total to find the amount of oil in the remaining 14 cans:

\( 290 - 80 = 210 \text{ liters} \)

So, each of the remaining 14 cans is holding 210 liters of oil.

First, we need to determine how many cans are remaining after accounting for the ones holding 8 liters each. Since there are 24 cans in total and 10 of them are holding 8 liters each, the number of remaining cans is:

\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

The total amount of oil in the remaining cans is the same as the total amount of oil in all the cans combined, which is 290 liters. Therefore, the amount of oil in each of the remaining cans is:

\[ \frac{290}{14} \]

Now, let's calculate that value.

\[ \frac{290}{14} = 20.7142857143 \]

So, each of the remaining cans is holding approximately 20.71 liters of oil.

To find out how much oil is in each of the remaining cans, we first need to calculate the total amount of oil in the 10 cans that are holding 8 liters each. This is done by multiplying 10 by 8:

\(10 \times 8 = 80\) liters of oil

Now we know that there are 290 liters of oil in total and 80 liters are accounted for by the 10 cans. To find out how much oil is in the remaining cans, we subtract the 80 liters from the total:

\(290 - 80 = 210\) liters of oil

Now we need to find out how many cans are left. Since we started with 24 cans and 10 are accounted for (8-liter cans), the number of remaining cans is:

\(24 - 10 = 14\) cans

Finally, to find out how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding, we divide the total amount of oil in the remaining cans by the number of remaining cans:

\(210 \div 14 = 15\) liters

So, each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil.

To find out how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of oil held by the 10 cans that are holding 8 liters each.
2. Subtract the total amount of oil in these 10 cans from the total amount of oil to find out how much oil is left.
3. Divide the remaining amount of oil by the number of remaining cans to find out how much each of the remaining cans is holding.

Let's do this step by step:

1. Total amount of oil in 10 cans = 10 cans * 8 liters/can = 80 liters.
2. Remaining oil = Total oil - Oil in 10 cans = 290 liters - 80 liters = 210 liters.
3. Number of remaining cans = Total cans - 10 cans = 24 cans - 10 cans = 14 cans.
4. Oil per remaining can = Remaining oil / Number of remaining cans = 210 liters / 14 cans = 15 liters/can.

Therefore, each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil.

Reasoning:
First, we need to calculate the total amount of oil in the 10 cans that are holding 8 liters each.
8 liters/can * 10 cans = 80 liters

Next, we subtract this amount from the total amount of oil to find out how much oil is in the remaining 14 cans:
290 liters - 80 liters = 210 liters

Now, we divide this amount by the number of remaining cans to find out how much each of the remaining cans is holding:
210 liters / 14 cans = 15 liters/can

Each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil.

To determine how much oil each of the remaining 14 cans is holding, we first need to calculate the total amount of oil in the 10 cans that are holding 8 liters each.

\[ \text{Total oil in 10 cans} = 10 \text{ cans} \times 8 \text{ liters/can} = 80 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we subtract the oil from these 10 cans from the total amount of oil to find out how much oil is in the remaining 14 cans.

\[ \text{Total oil in remaining 14 cans} = 290 \text{ liters} - 80 \text{ liters} = 210 \text{ liters} \]

To find out how much oil each of the remaining 14 cans is holding, we divide the total oil in these cans by the number of remaining cans.

Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of oil in the 10 cans that are holding 8 liters each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total oil to find out how much is left. Finally, we divide the remaining oil by the number of the remaining cans to find out how much each of the remaining cans is holding.

Calculation:

1. The total oil in 10 cans at 8 liters each is \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) liters.
2. Subtract this amount from the total oil to find out how much is left: \( 290 - 80 = 210 \) liters.
3. Divide the remaining oil by the number of the remaining cans to find out how much each of the remaining cans is holding: \( 210 \div 14 = 15 \) liters.

So, each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil.

To find out how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to calculate the total amount of oil in the 10 cans that are holding 8 liters each. This can be done by multiplying the number of cans holding 8 liters each by the amount of oil each of those cans is holding:

\[ \text{Total oil in 10 cans} = 10 \times 8 \]

\[ \text{Total oil in 10 cans} = 80 \text{ liters} \]

2. Now, we know there are 290 liters of oil in total. To find out how much oil is left for the remaining cans, we subtract the amount of oil in the 10 cans from the total amount of oil:

\[ \text{Total oil in remaining cans} = 290 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Total oil in remaining cans} = 210 \text{ liters} \]

3. There are 24 cans in total, and 10 of them are holding 8 liters each, which means there are \(24 - 10 = 14\) cans left. To find out how much oil each of these remaining cans is holding, we divide the total oil in the remaining cans by the number of remaining cans:

\[ \text{Oil per remaining can} = \frac{\text{Total oil in remaining cans}}{\text{Number of remaining cans}} \]

\[ \text{Oil per remaining can} = \frac{210}{14} \]

\[ \text{Oil per remaining can} = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil.

To solve this, first calculate the total amount of oil in the 10 cans that hold 8 liters each. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of cans by the amount of oil each can holds: 10 * 8 = 80 liters. 

Next, subtract this amount from the total to find the amount of oil in the remaining cans: 290 - 80 = 210 liters. 

Since these remaining cans hold the same amount of oil, divide the total amount by the number of the remaining cans to find the amount each can holds: 210 / 14 = 15 liters.

Therefore, the answer is 15 liters.

Reasoning:

1. We start by calculating the total amount of oil in the 10 cans that hold 8 liters each.

   Total oil in these 10 cans = 10 × 8 = 80 liters.

2. We then subtract the oil in these 10 cans from the total amount of oil to find out how much oil is left for the remaining cans.

   Remaining oil = Total oil - Oil in 10 cans = 290 - 80 = 210 liters.

3. We know there are 24 cans in total, and we've accounted for 10 of them. Therefore, the remaining cans are:

   Remaining cans = Total cans - 10 = 24 - 10 = 14 cans.

4. To find out how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding, we divide the remaining oil by the number of remaining cans.

   Oil per remaining can = Remaining oil ÷ Remaining cans = 210 ÷ 14 = 15 liters.

Answer:

Each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil.
