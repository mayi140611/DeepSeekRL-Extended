###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

An elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class.  She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?

To minimize the cost, the teacher should ensure that as many students as possible receive the cheaper option first. Since individual bags are cheaper than packs, we start by giving individual vampire-themed bags to 11 students. This uses up the 11 vampire-themed bags and leaves 10 students still needing Halloween bags. The remaining 10 students then receive the cheaper pumpkin-themed bags.

Thus, the teacher gives 11 vampire-themed individual bags and 10 pumpkin-themed individual bags. This totals:
\[11 + 10 = 21 \text{ bags}\]

The cost for these bags is:
\[11 \text{ vampire-themed bags} \times \$1 + 10 \text{ pumpkin-themed bags} \times \$1 = \$11 + \$10 = \$21.\]

Therefore, the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags is \$21.

The teacher wants to buy 11 vampire-themed bags and 14 pumpkin-themed bags. The teacher has two options for purchasing these bags: buying packages of 5 bags each at a price of $3 per package, or buying individual bags at a price of $1 each.

To minimize costs, the teacher should buy as many full packages as possible and then buy any remaining individual bags. We calculate the number of full packages:

11 vampire-themed bags divide evenly by 5, giving 2 packages. 
14 pumpkin-themed bags divide evenly by 5, giving 2 packages.
So, the teacher needs 2 packages of vampire-themed bags and 2 packages of pumpkin-themed bags, which will cost \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars in total from packages.

Next, the teacher buys the remaining individual bags:
11 - (2 vampire-themed bags) = 9 vampire-themed bags left to buy individually.
14 - (2 pumpkin-themed bags) = 12 pumpkin-themed bags left to buy individually.
These 12 pumpkin-themed bags cost 12 dollars individually.

In total, the cost is 6 + 12 = 18 dollars.

Therefore, the least amount of money the teacher can spend is $18.

The teacher needs to buy 11 vampire-themed bags and 14 pumpkin-themed bags. Since the store sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, we need to determine how many packages she needs and if there is any shortage of bags.

For the vampire-themed bags:
- She needs 11 bags.
- Each package contains 5 bags, so she needs \( \lceil 11 / 5 \rceil = 3 \) packages.

For the pumpkin-themed bags:
- She needs 14 bags.
- Each package contains 5 bags, so she needs \( \lceil 14 / 5 \rceil = 3 \) packages.

Thus, the total number of packages required is 3 (for vampire bags) + 3 (for pumpkin bags) = 6 packages.

Now let's check the total cost:
- Cost of 6 packages of vampire-themed bags: \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars.
- Cost of 6 packages of pumpkin-themed bags: \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars.

So, the total cost is \( 18 + 18 = 36 \) dollars.

Therefore, the teacher can spend a total of $36 on the gift bags.

First, we need to determine the total number of packs of each theme and the number of individual bags needed for each theme.

There are 11 students who want vampire-themed bags, and each pack contains 5 bags. Therefore, the teacher needs \( \frac{11}{5} = 2.2 \) packs, which means she needs 3 packs (since she can't buy a fraction of a pack).

There are 14 students who want pumpkin-themed bags, and each pack also contains 5 bags. Therefore, the teacher needs \( \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \) packs, which means she needs 3 packs (again, as buying a fraction of a pack isn't practical).

Additionally, there are 11 students who want vampire-themed bags and 14 students who want pumpkin-themed bags, and these numbers already include those who want both, so there is no need for any individual packages in this case.

Next, we calculate the cost for each theme:
- The cost for the packs of vampire-themed bags is \( 3 \times 3 = \$9 \).
- The cost for the packs of pumpkin-themed bags is \( 3 \times 3 = \$9 \).
- The total cost for the packs is \( 9 + 9 = \$18 \).

Then, we calculate the cost for the individual pumpkin-themed bags. There are \( 14 - 3 = 11 \) students who requested pumpkin-themed bags but don't want packs, so the teacher needs \( 11 \times 1 = \$11 \) for these additional bags.

Finally, we sum up the costs. The total amount spent is \( 18 + 11 = \$29 \).

To minimize the cost, the teacher should buy as many packs as possible for each theme, as each pack of 5 bags costs $3 compared to $1 for individual bags.

For the vampire-themed bags:
- 11 students want bags, so the teacher can buy 2 packs (2 \times 5 = 10 bags), which costs 2 \times $3 = $6.
- After buying 2 packs, there are 1 student left who wants a vampire-themed bag, so the teacher buys 1 individual bag for $1.
- The total cost for vampire-themed bags is $6 + $1 = $7.

For the pumpkin-themed bags:
- 14 students want bags, so the teacher buys 2 packs (2 \times 5 = 10 bags), which costs 2 \times $3 = $6.

The total cost for pumpkin-themed bags is $6.

The total cost for all the bags is $7 (for vampire-themed) + $6 (for pumpkin-themed) = $13.

Therefore, the least amount of money the teacher can spend is $13.

To determine the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags, we need to consider the most cost-effective way to fulfill the students' requests. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the total number of each type of bag needed:**
   - 11 students want vampire-themed bags.
   - 14 students want pumpkin-themed bags.

   Therefore, the teacher needs:
   - 11 vampire-themed bags.
   - 14 pumpkin-themed bags.

2. **Calculate the cost of purchasing the vampire-themed bags in bulk:**
   - The store sells packs of 5 vampire-themed bags for $3 per package.
   - Since the teacher needs 11 vampire-themed bags, we need to determine how many packages are required:
     \[
     \frac{11}{5} = 2.2
     \]
   - Since the teacher cannot buy a fraction of a package, she needs to round up to the next whole number:
     \[
     3 \text{ packs}
     \]
   - The cost for 3 packs of vampire-themed bags is:
     \[
     3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of purchasing the pumpkin-themed bags individually:**
   - The store sells individual pumpkin-themed bags for $1 each.
   - The teacher needs 14 pumpkin-themed bags, so the cost is:
     \[
     14 \times 1 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Adding the cost of the vampire-themed bags and the pumpkin-themed bags:
     \[
     9 + 14 = 23 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - The teacher can buy 3 packs of vampire-themed bags, which is sufficient for 11 students, and the remaining 3 students can get individual bags.
   - This approach allows the teacher to buy everything needed while minimizing costs.

Thus, the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]

To minimize the cost, the teacher should buy the smallest packages that can accommodate all the students' requests. Since the store sells packages of 5 for $3 each and individual bags for $1 each, we need to find the optimal combination of packages and individual bags to buy.

First, let's calculate how many packs and individual bags are needed to cover all 25 students:

- For the vampire-themed bags, there are 11 students requesting them. Each pack contains 5 bags, so we need \( \lceil 11/5 \rceil = 3 \) packs (since 3 packs cover 15 students, which is more than enough for 11 students).
- For the pumpkin-themed bags, there are 14 students requesting them. Each pack also contains 5 bags, so we need \( \lceil 14/5 \rceil = 3 \) packs (since 3 packs cover 15 students, which is more than enough for 14 students).
- There are no individual bags required since the packs already provide the needed individual bags.

So, the teacher needs 3 packs of vampire-themed bags and 3 packs of pumpkin-themed bags, which costs \( 3 \times 3 + 3 \times 3 = 9 + 9 = $18 \).

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the individual bags for the students who requested them:

- There are 25 students in total, and 3 packs are needed for 20 students, leaving 5 students' requests unfulfilled. Each pack of individual bags costs $1, so the teacher needs 5 individual bags, which costs \( 5 \times 1 = $5 \).

The total cost is \( 18 + 5 = $23 \).

Therefore, the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags is $23.

First, we need to determine the total number of vampire-themed and pumpkin-themed bags needed. Since 11 students want vampire-themed bags and 14 students want pumpkin-themed bags, the teacher needs to buy 11 vampire-themed bags and 14 pumpkin-themed bags.

Each pack of 5 bags for either theme costs $3, and individual bags of each theme cost $1 each. Therefore, the teacher should buy as many packs as possible for each theme to minimize costs.

For vampire-themed bags:
- The teacher can buy 2 packs (5 bags each), which costs $6.
- After buying 2 packs, the teacher has 1 bag left to buy individually, which costs $1.

For pumpkin-themed bags:
- The teacher can buy 2 packs (5 bags each), which costs $6.
- After buying 2 packs, the teacher has 2 bags left to buy individually, which cost $2.

The total cost is calculated as follows:
- Cost for 2 packs of vampire-themed bags: $6
- Cost for 2 individual vampire-themed bags: $2
- Cost for 2 packs of pumpkin-themed bags: $6
- Cost for 2 individual pumpkin-themed bags: $4

The total cost is:
\[ 6 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 20 \]

Therefore, the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags is $20.

The teacher wants to buy 11 vampire-themed bags and 14 pumpkin-themed bags for her students. The store sells packs of 5 bags of each theme at a price of $3 per package and individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each. Since the teacher needs more than 5 vampire-themed bags, she needs to buy at least one pack. Similarly, since she needs more than 5 pumpkin-themed bags, she also needs to buy at least one pack.

If she buys one pack of 5 vampire-themed bags and one pack of 5 pumpkin-themed bags, she spends $3 for each pack, totaling $3 + $3 = $6. She then needs to buy 11 - 5 = 6 additional vampire-themed bags, which will cost $1 * 6 = $6. She then needs to buy 14 - 5 = 9 additional pumpkin-themed bags, which will cost $1 * 9 = $9. Therefore, the total cost is $6 + $6 + $9 = $21.

However, this is not the least amount of money the teacher can spend. She could buy just the packs of 5 bags (which can cover both themes) and pay $6 to cover both themes. Therefore, the least amount of money she can spend is $6 + $6 = $12.

Thus, the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags is $12.

To minimize the cost, the teacher should buy the least expensive option for each theme. 

For the vampire-themed bags, which were requested by 11 students, the cost would be $1 each, so the teacher will spend $11 * $1 = $11.
For the pumpkin-themed bags, which were requested by 14 students, the cost would be $3 each, so the teacher will spend $14 * $3 = $42.

The total amount the teacher will spend is $11 + $42 = $53.

The teacher needs to buy 11 vampire-themed bags and 14 pumpkin-themed bags. The store sells packs of 5 bags at $3 each or individual bags at $1 each.

First, let's see if it's possible to purchase all the bags for the vampire-themed and pumpkin-themed customers within one pack of 5 and one individual bag:
- For 11 vampire-themed bags, we can buy 2 packs of 5 vampire-themed bags for $3 each, totaling $6, and buy the remaining 1 bag for $1, totaling $7.
- For 14 pumpkin-themed bags, we can buy 2 packs of 5 pumpkin-themed bags for $3 each, totaling $6, and buy the remaining 4 bags for $1 each, totaling $4.

The total cost for the vampire-themed bags is $7 (for 2 packs and 1 individual bag).
The total cost for the pumpkin-themed bags is $4 (for 2 packs and 4 individual bags).

The total cost for all the bags is $7 + $4 = $11. However, there is still a need to buy one more package of vampire-themed bags for the remaining 3 bags. We can buy 1 additional pack for $3, and buy 3 more bags for $3 each, totaling $3 + $9 = $12. 

So we can buy 2 packs of 5 vampire-themed bags (+1 individual bag) for $12.

The total cost for all the bags is $12 (for 2 packs and 1 individual pack).

However, we can save money by buying only 1 more pack of vampire-themed bags and 3 individual bags, which totals to $1 + $1 = $2.

So the minimum amount the teacher can spend on the bags is $11 + $2 = $13.

The minimum amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags is $13.

To determine the least amount of money the teacher can spend, we need to consider the options available for each theme and the cost structure of the store.

1. **Pumpkin-themed bags:** There are 4 students who want pumpkin-themed bags (since 14 out of 25 students want them, and we have to distribute them). 
   - Since packs of 5 are available and each pack costs $3, we need to buy 1 pack to have enough.
   - The cost for the packs is \(1 \times 3 = 3\) dollars.

2. **Vampire-themed bags:** There are 11 students who want vampire-themed bags.
   - The teacher can get 2 packs of 5 vampire-themed bags each, which totals \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vampire-themed bags.
   - The additional vampire-themed bags needed are \(11 - 10 = 1\).
   - Since individual vampire-themed bags cost $1 each, buying 1 additional vampire-themed bag will cost \(1 \times 1 = 1\) dollar.

3. **Total cost calculation:**
   - The cost for pumpkin-themed bags is $3.
   - The cost for vampire-themed bags is \(1 + 1 = 2\) dollars.
   - The total cost is \(3 + 2 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, the least amount of money the teacher can spend to get each student the theme they requested is 5 dollars.

To minimize the cost, we need to buy as many packages as possible and as many individual bags as needed.

The teacher needs to buy:
- 11 vampire-themed bags
- 14 pumpkin-themed bags

Packages of 5 bags each for vampire-themed bags will provide:
$$ \left\lfloor \frac{11}{5} \right\rfloor = 2 $$
packages of 5 bags each, with 1 bag left over.

Packages of 5 bags each for pumpkin-themed bags will provide:
$$ \left\lfloor \frac{14}{5} \right\rfloor = 2 $$
packages of 5 bags each, with 4 bags left over.

The remaining 1 bag and 4 bags are individual bags.

Each package of 5 vampire-themed bags costs $3, so the cost for vampire-themed bags is:
$$ 2 \times \$3 = \$6 $$

Each package of 5 pumpkin-themed bags costs $3, so the cost for pumpkin-themed bags is:
$$ 2 \times \$3 = \$6 $$

The remaining 1 vampire-themed bag and 4 pumpkin-themed bags are individual bags, which cost $1 each, so the cost for individual bags is:
$$ 1 \times \$1 + 4 \times \$1 = \$5 $$

Adding up all the costs, the total cost is:

To minimize the cost of the Halloween goodie bags, the teacher needs to identify the most popular theme and buy only the necessary quantities for that theme. 

1. The total number of students is 25.
2. 11 students want the vampire-themed bag.
3. 14 students want the pumpkin-themed bag.

The vampire-themed bag is cheaper (costing $1) than the pumpkin-themed bag (costing $3 per package).

To buy all the requested bags at minimum cost, the teacher should buy:

- As many vampire-themed bags as possible, since they are cheaper.
- Only buy pumpkin-themed bags for the remaining students if necessary.

Since 11 students want vampire-themed bags, the teacher can buy 11 packs of vampire-themed bags at $3 each, costing:
\[ 11 \times 3 = 33 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, the remaining 14 - 11 = 3 students want pumpkin-themed bags. The teacher will need to buy 3 individual pumpkin-themed bags:
