To determine how much James pays for 2 semesters, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the cost of 20 units for one semester:
   \[
   20 \text{ units/semester} \times \$50 \text{/unit} = \$1000 \text{/semester}
   \]

2. Since we want to find the cost for 2 semesters, we multiply the cost of one semester by 2:
   \[
   \$1000 \text{/semester} \times 2 \text{ semesters} = \$2000
   \]

Therefore, James pays $2000 for 2 semesters.

To determine how much James pays for 2 semesters, we need to calculate the cost for one semester and then multiply by 2.

1. Calculate the cost for one semester:
   - James takes 20 units per semester.
   - Each unit costs $50.
   - Therefore, the cost for one semester = 20 units * $50/unit = $1000.

2. Calculate the cost for 2 semesters:
   - The cost for one semester is $1000.
   - To find the cost for 2 semesters, multiply the cost of one semester by 2: $1000 * 2 = $2000.

So, James pays $2000 for 2 semesters.

To calculate the total cost of units for 2 semesters, we need to first find out how many units James takes in total for the 2 semesters, which is 20 units/semester * 2 semesters = 40 units. Then, we can multiply the total number of units by the cost per unit to get the total cost. Since each unit costs $50, the total cost is 40 units * $50/unit = $2000.

James takes 20 units per semester, and each unit costs $50. So, the cost for one semester is:
20 units/semester * $50/unit = $1000/semester

To find the cost for 2 semesters, we multiply the cost of one semester by 2:
$1000/semester * 2 semesters = $2000

Therefore, James pays $2000 for 2 semesters.

To determine how much James pays for 2 semesters, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per semester.
2. Multiply the cost per semester by the number of semesters.

Step 1: Calculate the cost per semester.
James takes 20 units per semester, and each unit costs $50. Therefore, the cost per semester is:
\[ 20 \text{ units/semester} \times \$50/\text{unit} = \$1000/\text{semester} \]

Step 2: Multiply the cost per semester by the number of semesters.
Since James repeats this process for 2 semesters, the total cost is:
\[ \$1000/\text{semester} \times 2 \text{ semesters} = \$2000 \]

So, the total amount James pays for 2 semesters is $2000.

To find out how much James pays for 2 semesters, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the cost for one unit for both semesters.
2. Then, calculate the total cost for 20 units for one semester.
3. Finally, multiply the cost for 20 units for one semester by 2 to cover the total for 2 semesters.

Let's proceed with the calculations:

1. Cost per unit per semester: $50.
2. Cost for 20 units for one semester: 20 units * $50/unit = $1000.
3. Cost for 2 semesters: $1000 * 2 = $2000.

To calculate the total cost, we first need to determine how many units James takes over the two semesters. Since he takes 20 units per semester, over 2 semesters he takes \(20 \times 2 = 40\) units. Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of units by the cost per unit. So the total cost is \(40 \times 50 = \$2000\).

James takes 20 units per semester, and each unit costs $50. Therefore, the cost per semester is \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) dollars. Since he is taking 2 semesters, the total cost is \( 1000 \times 2 = 2000 \) dollars. 

Adding all the information, the total amount he spends for 2 semesters is:
\[ 20 \text{ units/semester} \times \$50/\text{unit} \times 2 \text{ semesters} = $2000. \]

So, the total cost is $2000.

The total amount James pays for 2 semesters is \( 2000 \) dollars.
