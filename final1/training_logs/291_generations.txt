Mary used 15 gallons of fuel this week. Last week, she used 20% less fuel than this week, which means she used 80% of 15 gallons. To find the total fuel used, we need to calculate 20% of 15 gallons and add it to 15 gallons.
</reasoning>
<answer>
15 gallons * 20% = 3 gallons
15 gallons + 3 gallons = 18 gallons

Mary used 15 gallons of fuel this week. Last week she used 20% less fuel, which means she used 15 gallons - 20% of 15 gallons. 

15 gallons - (0.20 * 15 gallons) = 15 - 3 = 12 gallons.

So, last week she used 12 gallons of fuel.

In total, for the two weeks, she used 15 gallons + 12 gallons = 27 gallons.

Mary used 15 gallons of fuel this week. Last week she used 20% less, which is calculated as:

\( 15 \text{ gallons} \times 20\% = 15 \text{ gallons} \times \frac{20}{100} = 15 \text{ gallons} \times 0.2 = 3 \text{ gallons} \)

So, last week she used 3 gallons of fuel.

For the two weeks, the total fuel usage is the sum of the fuel used this week and last week:

\( 15 \text{ gallons} + 3 \text{ gallons} = 18 \text{ gallons} \)

Last week, Mary used 20% less fuel than she did this week. 

\(20\% \text{ of } 15 \text{ gallons} = 0.20 \times 15 = 3 \text{ gallons}\)

So, Mary used \(15 \text{ gallons} - 3 \text{ gallons} = 12 \text{ gallons}\) last week.

Total fuel used for the two weeks is \(15 \text{ gallons} + 12 \text{ gallons} = 27 \text{ gallons}\).

Last week, Mary used 20% less fuel than the week before. 20% of 15 gallons is 0.4 of 15 gallons, which is 15 * 0.2 = 3 gallons. So she used 15 - 3 = 12 gallons of fuel last week.

In total she had used 15 gallons of fuel last week + 12 gallons of fuel this week, which is 15 + 12 = 27 gallons.

First, calculate the fuel used last week when it is 20% less than this week's fuel usage:
20% of 15 gallons = 0.20 * 15 gallons = 3 gallons

Now, subtract that amount from this week's fuel usage to find last week's fuel usage:
15 gallons - 3 gallons = 12 gallons

Next, add the fuel used this week to the fuel used last week to find the total:
15 gallons + 12 gallons = 27 gallons

So, Mary used a total of 27 gallons of fuel for the two weeks.

15 gallons is 100%-20% = 80% of the fuel used last week.

So last week she used 80% / 100% * 15 gallons = 12 gallons

So the total fuel used is 15 gallons + 12 gallons = 27 gallons.

To find out how much fuel Mary used in total for the two weeks, we need to first calculate how much fuel she used last week.

Last week, she used 20% less fuel than this week, which means she used 80% of this week's fuel. 

So, 80% of 15 gallons is \(15 \times 0.80 = 12\) gallons.

Now we add this to this week's fuel usage:

\(15 + 12 = 27\) gallons.

Therefore, the total fuel used over the two weeks is 27 gallons.
