800
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find the total profit, we first understand the ratio of the shares: Mike : Johnson = 2:5. This means that for every $7 in profit (since 2 + 5 = 7), Mike gets 2 units and Johnson gets 5 units.

Given that Johnson got $2500, which corresponds to 5 units of the ratio, we can calculate the worth of 1 unit:
\[ \text{Worth of 1 unit} = \frac{2500}{5} = \$500 \]

Thus, the worth of Mike's share would be:
\[ \text{Mike's share} = 2 \times \$500 = \$1000 \]

Now, Mike spends $200 on a shirt. So, the remaining amount he would have is:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$1000 - \$200 = \$800 \]

Therefore, Mike will have $800 after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200.

To determine how much Mike will have after spending $200 on a shirt, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the whole ratio:**
   The ratio of the profit shared between Mike and Johnson is 2:5.

2. **Calculate the shares:**
   Since the total ratio parts are:
   \[
   2 + 5 = 7
   \]
   Johnson's share is:
   \[
   \frac{5}{7} \text{ of the total profit}
   \]
   Given Johnson got $2500, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{5}{7} \times \text{Total Profit} = 2500
   \]
   Solving for the Total Profit:
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = 2500 \times \frac{7}{5} = 3500
   \]

3. **Calculate Mike's share:**
   Mike's share corresponds to:
   \[
   \frac{2}{7} \text{ of the total profit}
   \]
   Therefore, Mike's share is:
   \[
   \text{Mike's Share} = 3500 \times \frac{2}{7} = 1000
   \]

4. **Subtract the cost of the shirt:**
   Mike spends $200 on the shirt. Therefore, the amount left after the purchase is:
   \[
   1000 - 200 = 800
   \]

5. **Determine the new share:**
   Mike's new share after the purchase is $800.

**Final answer:**

Mike will have **$800** after spending $200 on the shirt.

To find out how much Mike will have left after spending $200 on a shirt, we first need to determine Mike's original share of the profit.

The profit is shared in the ratio of 2:5 between Mike and Johnson. This means that for every 7 parts of the profit, Mike gets 2 parts and Johnson gets 5 parts.

Given that Johnson gets $2500, we can set up a proportion to find out how much one part is worth:

\[ \frac{2}{7} = \frac{J}{2500} \]

\[ J = \frac{2}{7} \times 2500 \]

\[ J = \frac{5000}{7} \]

\[ J = 714.28... \]

Now, we can find out how much Mike's share is:

\[ Mike's\ share = \frac{2}{7} \times 2500 \]

\[ Mike's\ share = \frac{5000}{7} \]

\[ Mike's\ share = 714.28... \]

So, Mike's share of the profit initially amounts to approximately $714.28.

After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have:

\[ Mike's\ remaining\ amount = Mike's\ share - shirt\ cost \]

\[ Mike's\ remaining\ amount = 714.28... - 200 \]

\[ Mike's\ remaining\ amount = 514.28... \]

Therefore, after spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have approximately $514.28 left.

Let's calculate the total profit first. Johnson received $2500, which represents 5 parts of the total ratio. Therefore, each part represents $2500 / 5 = $500.

Mike's share, being 2 parts, is $500 * 2 = $1000.

After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have $1000 - $200 = $800 left.

However, to directly answer the question, if I'm assuming the total profit is greater than the amount spent on the shirt, after spending $200, Mike will have $800 remaining. If the total profit is less than or equal to $200, then Mike will have exactly $800 left.

system
To solve this problem, let's first determine how much Mike and Johnson each share based on the given ratio.

The ratio of their shares is 2:5, which means for every 2 parts that Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 parts. The total number of parts is 2 + 5 = 7 parts.

Johnson got $2500, which corresponds to 5 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide Johnson's share by 5:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{\$2500}{5} = \$500 \]

Now that we know each part is worth $500, we can calculate Mike's share:
\[ \text{Mike's share} = 2 \times \$500 = \$1000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Mike has left after spending $200 on a shirt. The amount Mike has left is:
\[ \text{Amount left after shirt purchase} = \$1000 - \$200 = \$800 \]

Therefore, after spending on the shirt, Mike will have $800.

Given that the profit is shared between Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5, and Johnson received $2500, we can find out how much Mike received first.

Since the ratio for Johnson (5 parts) is the same as $2500, each part in the ratio represents $2500 / 5 = $500.

Therefore, Mike's share of the profit is 2 parts, which is 2 * $500 = $1000.

After spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200, Mike will have $1000 - $200 = $800.

To find out how much Mike will have after spending on a shirt, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total profit shared between Mike and Johnson:**
   - The profit is divided in the ratio 2:5 between Mike and Johnson. This means that for every 2 parts of profit Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 parts.
   - If Johnson gets $2500, we can set up a proportion to find out how much profit Mike gets.
   - Let \( J \) be the amount of profit Mike gets, and \( T \) be the total profit. Since the ratio is 2:5, we can write:
     \[
     \frac{J}{T} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
   - We know that \( J = 2500 \), so:
     \[
     2500 = \frac{2}{5} \times T
     \]
   - Solving for \( T \):
     \[
     T = \frac{2500 \times 5}{2} = 6250
     \]
   - Therefore, the total profit is $6250.

2. **Calculate Mike's share of the profit:**
   - Since Mike’s share is 2 out of the 7 parts:
     \[
     \text{Mike's share} = \frac{2}{7} \times 6250
     \]
     \[
     \text{Mike's share} = \frac{12500}{7} \approx 1785.71
     \]

3. **Subtract the cost of the shirt from Mike's share:**
   - Mike spends $200 on a shirt:
     \[
     \text{Mike's remaining amount} = 1785.71 - 200 = 1585.71
     \]

Therefore, Mike will have approximately $1585.71 after spending on the shirt.

Reasoning:

1. The ratio given is 2:5, which means for every 2 parts that Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 parts.
2. This total is equal to $2500 + $200 = $2700 (Mike spent $200 on the shirt).
3. To find out Mike's share, we notice that 2 parts are worth $2700.
4. One part, therefore, is worth $2700 / 2 = $1350.
5. Mike's share, which is 2 parts, is worth 2 x $1350 = $2700.
6. After spending $200 on the shirt, Mike's remaining amount is $2700 - $200 = $2500.

Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. We know that the profit is shared between Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5. This means for every 7 parts of the profit (2 parts for Mike + 5 parts for Johnson), Johnson gets 5 parts and Mike gets 2 parts.

2. We are told that Johnson got $2500. Since Johnson's share corresponds to 5 parts of the total profit, we can set up a proportion to find the value of one part:

   \[
   \frac{5 \text{ parts}}{2500} = \frac{1 \text{ part}}{x}
   \]
   
   Solving for \(x\), we get:

   \[
   x = \frac{2500}{5} = 500
   \]

   So, 1 part of the profit is worth $500.

3. Since Mike's share is 2 parts, we can calculate his profit:

   \[
   \text{Mike's profit} = 2 \times 500 = 1000
   \]

4. Now, we need to find out how much Mike has after spending $200 on a shirt:

   \[
   \text{Mike's remaining amount} = 1000 - 200 = 800
   \]

So, after spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have $800.

Given that the profit is shared in the ratio 2:5 and Johnson got $2500, we can first determine the total parts in the ratio. The total parts are 2 + 5 = 7 parts.

Since Johnson's share corresponds to 5 parts, we can set up a simple proportion to find the value of each part. Let the value of each part be \( x \). Then:
\[ 5x = 2500 \]
\[ x = \frac{2500}{5} = 500 \]

Each part is worth $500. Now, Mike's share would be 2 parts:
\[ \text{Mike's share} = 2 \times 500 = 1000 \]

After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike’s remaining amount will be:
