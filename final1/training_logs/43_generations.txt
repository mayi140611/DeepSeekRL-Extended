###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

An earthquake caused four buildings to collapse. Experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, since each one would make the foundations less stable. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake?

system
To determine the total number of buildings that had collapsed after four earthquakes, we need to analyze the pattern of collapse as described: each successive earthquake causes double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one. Let's denote the number of collapsing buildings in the first earthquake as \( B \).

For the first earthquake, we have:
\[ B \text{ buildings collapsed} \]

For the second earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed would be:
\[ 2B \text{ buildings} \]

For the third earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed would be:
\[ 4B \text{ buildings} \]

For the fourth earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed would be:
\[ 8B \text{ buildings} \]

The total number of buildings that collapsed from all four earthquakes is the sum of the buildings that collapsed in each of the four earthquakes:
\[ B + 2B + 4B + 8B = 15B \]

Since we do not know the actual value of \( B \), the total number of buildings that had collapsed is \( 15B \). However, if we assume that the initial count of \( B \) is 1 (since the exact number of buildings collapsed in the first earthquake is not provided), then the total number of buildings that collapsed would be:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, including those from the first earthquake, the total number of buildings that had collapsed is 15.

In the first earthquake, 4 buildings collapsed.

In the second earthquake, the number of collapsed buildings will be double that of the first earthquake, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) buildings.

In the third earthquake, the number of collapsed buildings will be double that of the second earthquake, so \(8 \times 2 = 16\) buildings.

In the fourth earthquake, the number of collapsed buildings will be double that of the third earthquake, so \(16 \times 2 = 32\) buildings.

Including the first earthquake, the total number of collapsed buildings after three more earthquakes is \(4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 50\).

The first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse.

Each subsequent earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, due to the weakened foundations. 

1. First earthquake: 4 buildings collapsed.
2. Second earthquake: 2 * 4 = 8 buildings collapsed.
3. Third earthquake: 2 * 8 = 16 buildings collapsed.
4. Fourth earthquake: 2 * 16 = 32 buildings collapsed.

Adding them up: 4 (first earthquake) + 8 (second earthquake) + 16 (third earthquake) + 32 (fourth earthquake) = 60 buildings in total collapsed.

Answer: 60 buildings collapsed including those from the first earthquake.

The number of collapsing buildings after each earthquake form a geometric sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 4 (the number of buildings that collapsed in the first earthquake) and the common ratio \(r\) is 2 (since each earthquake doubles the number of collapsing buildings).

The number of buildings that collapsed after the first earthquake is \(a_1 = 4\).

After the first earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings is:
\[a_2 = a_1 \times r = 4 \times 2 = 8\]

After the second earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings is:
\[a_3 = a_2 \times r = 8 \times 2 = 16\]

After the third earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings is:
\[a_4 = a_3 \times r = 16 \times 2 = 32\]

After the fourth earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings is:
\[a_5 = a_4 \times r = 32 \times 2 = 64\]

To find the total number of collapsing buildings after four earthquakes, we add the number of buildings that collapsed in each earthquake:
\[4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 124\]

Therefore, the total number of buildings that had collapsed after four earthquakes is 124, including those from the first earthquake.

To find out how many buildings collapsed in total, we need to consider the doubling nature of the number of collapsing buildings after each earthquake. 

1. After the first earthquake, 4 buildings collapsed.
2. The second earthquake saw double the number: 4 * 2 = 8 buildings collapsing.
3. The third earthquake saw double the number of buildings that collapsed in the second earthquake: 8 * 2 = 16 buildings collapsing.
4. For the fourth earthquake, double the number of buildings that collapsed in the third earthquake: 16 * 2 = 32 buildings collapsing.

Adding up all the buildings that collapsed:

4 (first earthquake) + 8 (second earthquake) + 16 (third earthquake) + 32 (fourth earthquake) = 60 buildings collapsed in total.

Therefore, the answer is 60 buildings collapsed including those from the first earthquake.

To determine the total number of buildings that collapsed after three more earthquakes, we start by calculating the number of buildings that collapsed in each earthquake:

1. The first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse.
   
2. The second earthquake, with the predictions of doubling the number of collapsing buildings, saw \(4 \times 2 = 8\) buildings collapsing.
   
3. The third earthquake saw \(8 \times 2 = 16\) buildings collapse.
   
4. The fourth earthquake saw \(16 \times 2 = 32\) buildings collapse.

We now sum up all the buildings that collapsed:

- First earthquake: 4 buildings
- Second earthquake: 8 buildings
- Third earthquake: 16 buildings
- Fourth earthquake: 32 buildings

Total number of buildings collapsed = \(4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60\).

Therefore, the answer is 60.

The number of collapsed buildings for each earthquake forms a geometric sequence where the first term \( a = 4 \) (the number of buildings collapsed in the first earthquake) and the common ratio \( r = 2 \) (each earthquake has double the number of collapses compared to the previous earthquake).

The number of buildings collapsed in the \( n \)-th earthquake can be calculated using the formula for the \( n \)-th term of a geometric sequence:
\[ a_n = a \cdot r^{(n-1)} \]

For the third earthquake:
\[ a_3 = 4 \cdot 2^{(3-1)} = 4 \cdot 2^2 = 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \]

The total number of buildings collapsed is the sum of the first five terms of this geometric sequence:
\[ S_n = a \cdot \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

For \( n = 5 \):
\[ S_5 = 4 \cdot \frac{2^5 - 1}{2 - 1} = 4 \cdot (32 - 1) = 4 \cdot 31 = 124 \]

Therefore, the total number of buildings collapsed including those from the first earthquake is \( \boxed{124} \).

To determine the total number of buildings that had collapsed after three more earthquakes, we start with the initial number of collapsed buildings from the first earthquake, which is 4.

The number of collapsed buildings after each subsequent earthquake is predicted to double the previous count. This can be represented by the following sequence of numbers:

1. After the first earthquake, there are \(4\) buildings collapsed.
2. After the second earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
3. After the third earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
4. After the fourth earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed is \(16 \times 2 = 32\).

Now, we sum up all the buildings that collapsed in each of the four earthquakes:

\[
4 \text{ (first earthquake)} + 8 \text{ (second earthquake)} + 16 \text{ (third earthquake)} + 32 \text{ (fourth earthquake)}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60
\]

Therefore, the total number of buildings that had collapsed after four earthquakes is 60.

Let's examine the situation starting with the first earthquake. We know that the first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse. Each subsequent earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one.

To calculate the number of buildings that collapsed after three more earthquakes, we can follow these steps:

1. **First earthquake:**
   - Buildings collapsed: **4**

2. **Second earthquake:**
   - Buildings collapsed: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)

3. **Third earthquake:**
   - Buildings collapsed: \(8 \times 2 = 16\)

4. **Fourth earthquake:**
   - Buildings collapsed: \(16 \times 2 = 32\)

Now, to find the total number of buildings that collapsed after all four earthquakes, we sum the number of buildings from each earthquake:

- **After the first earthquake:** 4 buildings
- **After the second earthquake:** 8 buildings
- **After the third earthquake:** 16 buildings
- **After the fourth earthquake:** 32 buildings

Adding them together:

\[
4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60
\]

Thus, the total number of buildings that had collapsed after the first four earthquakes is **36**.

The number of collapsing buildings after each earthquake follows a geometric progression where the first term \( a = 4 \) and the common ratio \( r = 2 \). We need to find the total number of collapsing buildings after three more earthquakes.

After the first earthquake, there are 4 buildings collapsed. After the second earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed is \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \). Similarly, after the third earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \). After the fourth earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed is \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \).

To find the total number of collapsing buildings after four earthquakes, we sum the number of buildings collapsed in each earthquake:

\[
4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 50

To determine the total number of collapsed buildings after three more earthquakes, we need to follow a step-by-step reasoning process:

1. **Initial Condition**: 
   - In the first earthquake, 4 buildings collapsed.
   - The number of buildings that collapse in each subsequent earthquake is double the number from the previous earthquake.

2. **First Earthquake**:
   - Buildings collapsed: \(4\)

3. **Second Earthquake** (Double the first earthquake):
   - Buildings collapsed: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)

4. **Third Earthquake** (Double the second earthquake):
   - Buildings collapsed: \(8 \times 2 = 16\)

5. **Fourth Earthquake** (Double the third earthquake):
   - Buildings collapsed: \(16 \times 2 = 32\)

6. **Total Buildings Collapsed**:
   - Buildings collapsed from the first earthquake to the fourth: \(4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 5�

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Including the buildings that collapsed in the first earthquake, the total number of buildings collapsed is \((4 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32) = 58\).

So, the total number of buildings that collapsed after three more earthquakes, including those from the first earthquake, is \(58\).

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of buildings that collapsed after three more earthquakes, given that each subsequent earthquake causes double the number of buildings to collapse as the previous one. Let's break it down:

1. **First Earthquake:** It caused 4 buildings to collapse.
2. **Second Earthquake:** It would cause `4 * 2` (double the number from the first earthquake), i.e., 8 buildings.
3. **Third Earthquake:** It would cause `8 * 2` (double the number from the second earthquake), i.e., 16 buildings.
4. **Fourth Earthquake:** It would cause `16 * 2` (double the number from the third earthquake), i.e., 32 buildings.

Now, let's sum up all the buildings that collapsed:

- First earthquake: 4 buildings
- Second earthquake: 8 buildings
- Third earthquake: 16 buildings
- Fourth earthquake: 32 buildings

Total number of buildings that collapsed = `4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60` buildings.

Therefore, the total number of buildings that collapsed after three more earthquakes is **60**.

To solve this, let's calculate the number of buildings that collapsed in each of the four earthquakes:

- The first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse.
- The second earthquake would cause double the number of the first: 4 * 2 = 8 buildings.
- The third earthquake would cause double the number of the second: 8 * 2 = 16 buildings.
- The fourth earthquake would cause double the number of the third: 16 * 2 = 32 buildings.

Adding them all up: 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60 buildings collapsed in total.

Therefore, the answer is 60 buildings collapsed including those from the first earthquake.

To determine the total number of buildings that had collapsed, we need to follow the pattern of the number of collapsed buildings after each earthquake.

1. **First earthquake**: 4 buildings collapsed.
   \[
   C_1 = 4
   \]

2. **Second earthquake**: Each subsequent earthquake has double the number of collapsed buildings as the previous one.
   \[
   C_2 = 2 \times C_1
   \]
   \[
   C_2 = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Third earthquake**: The pattern continues, so each earthquake will double the number of collapsed buildings from the previous one.
   \[
   C_3 = 2 \times C_2
   \]
   \[
   C_3 = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

4. **Fourth earthquake**: Again, each earthquake will have double the number of collapsed buildings as the previous one.
   \[
   C_4 = 2 \times C_3
   \]
   \[
   C_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of buildings that collapsed in each earthquake to find the total:
\[
C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 = 4 + 8 + 16 + 32
\]

\[
4 + 8 = 12
\]
\[
12 + 16 = 28
\]
\[
28 + 32 = 60
\]

Thus, after four earthquakes, the total number of buildings that collapsed is \( 60 \).

The first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse. The second earthquake would cause \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) buildings to collapse, and so on. Let's calculate the total number of buildings that collapsed after the fourth earthquake.

1. First earthquake: 4 buildings collapsed.
2. Second earthquake: 4 * 2 = 8 buildings collapsed.
3. Third earthquake: 8 * 2 = 16 buildings collapsed.
4. Fourth earthquake: 16 * 2 = 32 buildings collapsed.

To find the total number of buildings that collapsed, we sum the number of buildings from each earthquake:

4 (from the first earthquake) + 8 (from the second earthquake) + 16 (from the third earthquake) + 32 (from the fourth earthquake) = 60 buildings collapsed.
