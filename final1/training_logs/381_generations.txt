On Tuesday, he worked half the number of minutes he worked on Monday, which is \( \frac{450}{2} = 225 \) minutes.
On Wednesday, he worked for 300 minutes.

On Tuesday, Matt worked half the number of minutes he worked on Monday. So on Tuesday, he worked \(450 \text{ minutes} / 2 = 225 \text{ minutes}\).

On Wednesday, he worked for 300 minutes.

To find out how many more minutes he worked on Wednesday than on Tuesday, we subtract the number of minutes he worked on Tuesday from the number of minutes he worked on Wednesday:

\[300 \text{ minutes} - 225 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}\]

So, Matt worked 75 more minutes on Wednesday than on Tuesday.
