To find the total square footage of shingles needed, we need to calculate the area of the house and the area of the porch separately, and then add them together.

The area of the house is given by its length times its width:
\[ \text{Area of the house} = 20.5 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 205 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the porch is given by its length times its width:
\[ \text{Area of the porch} = 6 \text{ feet} \times 4.5 \text{ feet} = 27 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these two areas together gives us the total square footage of shingles needed:
\[ \text{Total area} = 205 \text{ square feet} + 27 \text{ square feet} = 232 \text{ square feet} \]

So, 232 square feet of shingles will be needed to roof the house and the porch.

To determine the total square footage of shingles needed, we need to calculate the area of the house and the porch separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the area of the house:
\[
\text{Area of the house} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 20.5 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet}
\]
\[
\text{Area of the house} = 205 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of the porch:
\[
\text{Area of the porch} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4.5 \, \text{feet}
\]
\[
\text{Area of the porch} = 27 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Now, we add the two areas together to get the total area that needs shingles:
\[
\text{Total square footage} = \text{Area of the house} + \text{Area of the porch}
\]
\[
\text{Total square footage} = 205 \, \text{square feet} + 27 \, \text{square feet}
\]
\[
\text{Total square footage} = 232 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Therefore, 232 square feet of shingles will be needed to roof the house and the porch.

To find the total square footage of shingles needed, we first calculate the area of the house and the porch separately, and then add them together.

The area of the house is calculated by multiplying the length by the width:
\[ \text{House Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 20.5 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 205 \, \text{square feet} \]

The area of the porch is calculated similarly:
\[ \text{Porch Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4.5 \, \text{feet} = 27 \, \text{square feet} \]

To find the total area needing shingles, we add the house area and the porch area:
\[ \text{Total Area} = \text{House Area} + \text{Porch Area} = 205 \, \text{square feet} + 27 \, \text{square feet} = 232 \, \text{square feet} \]

So, 232 square feet of shingles will be needed to roof the house and the porch.

To calculate the total square footage of shingles needed for the house and the porch, we need to find the area of each and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the area of the house. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. For the house, the length is 20.5 feet and the width is 10 feet. So, the area of the house is:
\[ \text{Area of the house} = 20.5 \times 10 = 205 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the area of the porch. The length of the porch is 6 feet and the width is 4.5 feet. So, the area of the porch is:
\[ \text{Area of the porch} = 6 \times 4.5 = 27 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now, to find the total area that needs shingles, we add the area of the house to the area of the porch:
\[ \text{Total area} = \text{Area of the house} + \text{Area of the porch} = 205 + 27 = 232 \, \text{square feet} \]

So, we will need 232 square feet of shingles to roof the house and the porch.

To calculate the total square footage of shingles needed, we need to find the area of the house and the area of the porch separately, and then add them together. 

For the house, the area is calculated by multiplying its length by its width:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{house}} = 20.5 \times 10 = 205 \text{ square feet} \]

For the porch, the area is calculated in the same way:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{porch}} = 6 \times 4.5 = 27 \text{ square feet} \]

To find the total area, we add the two areas together:
\[ \text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_{\text{house}} + \text{Area}_{\text{porch}} = 205 + 27 = 232 \text{ square feet} \]

So, 232 square feet of shingles will be needed to roof the house and the porch.

First, we need to calculate the area of the house and the porch.

For the house, the area is \( 20.5 \times 10 \).

For the porch, the area is \( 6 \times 4.5 \).

After calculating these areas, we can add them together to get the total area of shingles needed.

Let's calculate these values.

The area of the house is \( 20.5 \times 10 = 205 \) square feet.

The area of the porch is \( 6 \times 4.5 = 27 \) square feet.

Adding these areas together, the total area of shingles needed is \( 205 + 27 = 232 \) square feet.

\[ \text{Area of the house} = 20.5 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} \]

\[ \text{Area of the porch} = 27 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now, let's add the two areas to find the total square footage of shingles needed:

To find the total square footage of shingles needed for the house and the porch, we need to calculate the area of each structure separately and then sum them up.

1. For the house:
   - The house is 20.5 feet by 10 feet.
   - Area of the house = 20.5 feet * 10 feet = 205 square feet.

2. For the porch:
   - The porch is 6 feet by 4.5 feet.
   - Area of the porch = 6 feet * 4.5 feet = 27 square feet.

3. Adding the areas:
   - Total area = Area of the house + Area of the porch = 205 square feet + 27 square feet = 232 square feet.

Therefore, 232 square feet of shingles will be needed to roof the house and the porch.
