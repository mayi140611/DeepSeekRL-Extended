40
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out how many bananas Donna has, we first need to determine the number of bananas Dawn has.

Given that Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia, and Lydia has 60 bananas, we calculate the number of bananas Dawn has as follows:
\[ \text{Dawn's bananas} = \text{Lydia's bananas} + 40 \]
\[ \text{Dawn's bananas} = 60 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Dawn's bananas} = 100 \]

Now, for the total number of bananas Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have:
\[ \text{Total bananas} = 200 \]

Given that the total is the sum of the bananas of Dawn, Lydia, and Donna, and we know Dawn and Lydia's bananas add up to 160 (60 + 100), we can find out Donna's bananas by subtracting this sum from the total number of bananas:
\[ \text{Donna's bananas} = \text{Total bananas} - \text{Dawn's bananas} - \text{Lydia's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Donna's bananas} = 200 - 160 \]
\[ \text{Donna's bananas} = 40 \]

Therefore, Donna has 40 bananas.

system
Let's denote the number of bananas Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have as D, L, and Dn respectively.

From the given information, we know:
1) Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia: D = L + 40
2) The total number of bananas they have is 200: D + L + Dn = 200

We also know that Lydia has 60 bananas: L = 60

Now, let's substitute the value of L into the first equation to find D:
D = L + 40
D = 60 + 40
D = 100

Now, let's substitute the values of D and L into the total number of bananas equation:
D + L + Dn = 200
100 + 60 + Dn = 200
160 + Dn = 200

Now we can find the number of bananas Donna has by isolating Dn:
Dn = 200 - 160
Dn = 40

So, Donna has 40 bananas.

The final answer is:
- Dawn has 100 bananas
- Lydia has 60 bananas
- Donna has 40 bananas

To find out how many bananas Donna has, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that Lydia has 60 bananas.
2. Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia, so Dawn has 60 + 40 = 100 bananas.
3. The total number of bananas Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have is 200, so to find out how many bananas Donna has, we subtract the bananas Dawn and Lydia have from the total: 200 - 100 - 60 = 40.

Therefore, Donna has 40 bananas.

system
To find out how many bananas Donna has, let's first determine how many bananas Dawn has. Since Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia and Lydia has 60 bananas, we can calculate the number of bananas Dawn has as follows:

Dawn's bananas = Lydia's bananas + 40
Dawn's bananas = 60 bananas + 40 bananas
Dawn's bananas = 100 bananas

Now, we know the total number of bananas that Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have together is 200. So, we can subtract the number of bananas that Dawn and Lydia have from the total to find out how many bananas Donna has:

Total bananas = 200 bananas
Dawn's bananas + Lydia's bananas = 100 bananas + 60 bananas
Total bananas - (Dawn's bananas + Lydia's bananas) = Donna's bananas
200 bananas - 160 bananas = 40 bananas

Therefore, Donna has 40 bananas.

Let's calculate the number of bananas each person has.

First, we know Lydia has 60 bananas. Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia, so Dawn has:
60 bananas + 40 bananas = 100 bananas.

Now, let's find out how many bananas Lydia and Dawn have together:
60 bananas + 100 bananas = 160 bananas.

Since the total number of bananas is 200, we can find out how many bananas Donna has by subtracting the combined total of Lydia and Dawn's bananas from the total number of bananas:
200 bananas - 160 bananas = 40 bananas.

Therefore, Donna has 40 bananas.

system
Let's denote the number of bananas Lydia has as \( L \), the number of bananas Dawn has as \( D \), and the number of bananas Donna has as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of bananas they have together is 200.
2. Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia.
3. Lydia has 60 bananas.

First, we substitute the known value for Lydia into the equation for the total number of bananas:
\[ L = 60 \]

Next, we use the information that Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia:
\[ D = L + 40 = 60 + 40 = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Donna has by subtracting the number of bananas Lydia and Dawn have from the total number of bananas:
\[ N = 200 - (L + D) = 200 - (60 + 100) = 200 - 160 = 40 \]

So, the number of bananas Donna has is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]

2. Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia, so Dawn has:
   60 bananas (Lydia) + 40 bananas = 100 bananas.

3. Together, Lydia and Dawn have 60 + 100 = 160 bananas.

4. They have a total of 200 bananas.

5. To find out how many bananas Donna has, we subtract the total number of bananas Lydia and Dawn have from the overall total:
   200 bananas (total) - 160 bananas (Lydia and Dawn) = 40 bananas.

Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the total number of bananas Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have is 200.
2. We also know that Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia.
3. We are told that Lydia has 60 bananas.

Now, we need to find out how many bananas Donna has. 

Since Lydia has 60 bananas, and Dawn has 40 more than Lydia, we can calculate Dawn's bananas as:
Dawn's bananas = Lydia's bananas + 40
Dawn's bananas = 60 + 40
Dawn's bananas = 100

Now, if we add up all the bananas they have together, we should get the total of 200 bananas:
Total bananas = Dawn's bananas + Lydia's bananas + Donna's bananas
200 = 100 + 60 + Donna's bananas

Now we can find Donna's bananas by subtracting the total bananas of Dawn and Lydia from the total:
Donna's bananas = Total bananas - (Dawn's bananas + Lydia's bananas)
Donna's bananas = 200 - (100 + 60)
Donna's bananas = 200 - 160
Donna's bananas = 40

So, Donna has 40 bananas.

system
Let's denote the number of bananas that Dawn and Lydia have as we'll denote it as follows:

- Lydia has 60 bananas. This means we write:
  Lydia = 60

- Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia. So, we can write:
  Dawn = Lydia + 40
  Dawn = 60 + 40
  Dawn = 100

- The total number of bananas Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have is 200.

We already know that Lydia has 60 bananas and Dawn has 100 bananas, so let's calculate the number of bananas Donna has by subtracting the number of bananas that Dawn and Lydia have from the total number of bananas they have:

Total bananas = 200
Dawn's bananas = 100
Lydia's bananas = 60

Now, we can find the number of bananas Donna has:
Donna's bananas = Total bananas - (Dawn's bananas + Lydia's bananas)
Donna's bananas = 200 - (100 + 60)
Donna's bananas = 200 - 160
Donna's bananas = 40

Therefore, Donna has 40 bananas.

Let's denote the number of bananas each person has as follows:
- Dawn's bananas: \( D \)
- Lydia's bananas: \( L \)
- Donna's bananas: \( D_n \)

We are given that:
1. Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have a total of 200 bananas.
2. Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia.
3. Lydia has 60 bananas.

From the given information, we can translate the statements into equations.

1. Total bananas: \( D + L + D_n = 200 \)
2. Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia: \( D = L + 40 \)
3. Lydia has 60 bananas: \( L = 60 \)

Substituting \( L = 60 \) into the second equation:
\[ D = 60 + 40 \]

Calculating \( D \):
\[ D = 100 \]

Now, substituting \( D = 100 \) and \( L = 60 \) into the total bananas equation:
\[ 100 + 60 + D_n = 200 \]

Solving for \( D_n \):
\[ 160 + D_n = 200 \]
\[ D_n = 200 - 160 \]
\[ D_n = 40 \]

So, Donna has 40 bananas.

Putting the final answer:
Donna has 40 bananas.

Let's denote the number of bananas each person has as follows:
- Dawn: \( D \)
- Lydia: \( L \)
- Donna: \( N \)

According to the problem, Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia, so we can write this relationship as:
\[ D = L + 40 \]

It is also given that Lydia has 60 bananas:
\[ L = 60 \]

Now, we know the total number of bananas for all three is 200:
\[ D + L + N = 200 \]

Substituting \( L = 60 \) into the equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 60 + 40 = 100 \]

Now, we can substitute \( D = 100 \) and \( L = 60 \) into the total bananas equation:
\[ 100 + 60 + N = 200 \]
\[ 160 + N = 200 \]
\[ N = 200 - 160 \]
\[ N = 40 \]

So, Donna has 40 bananas.
