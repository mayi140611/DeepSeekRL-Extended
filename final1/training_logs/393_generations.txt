system
Let's denote the width of the sandbox as \( w \) and the length as \( l \). According to the problem, the length is twice the width, so we can write:
\[ l = 2w \]

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2l + 2w \]

Given that the perimeter is 30 feet, we can substitute the values:
\[ 30 = 2(2w) + 2w \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 30 = 4w + 2w \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 30 = 6w \]

To find the width \( w \), divide both sides by 6:
\[ w = \frac{30}{6} \]
\[ w = 5 \]

Therefore, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

To solve this problem, let's denote the width of the sandbox as \( w \) feet. Given that the length is twice the width, we can denote the length as \( 2w \) feet.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given perimeter and our expressions for length and width, we have:
\[ 30 = 2 \times (2w + w) \]
\[ 30 = 2 \times 3w \]
\[ 30 = 6w \]

Solving for \( w \):
\[ w = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \]

Therefore, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Let's denote the width of the sandbox as \( w \) and the length as \( l \). According to the given information, the length is twice the width, so we can write:

\[ l = 2w \]

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2l + 2w \]

We are given that the perimeter is 30 feet, so we can substitute the given values:

\[ 30 = 2l + 2w \]

Now we can substitute \( l \) with \( 2w \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 30 = 2(2w) + 2w \]
\[ 30 = 4w + 2w \]
\[ 30 = 6w \]

Now, we solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 6:

\[ w = \frac{30}{6} \]
\[ w = 5 \]

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

To find the width of the sandbox, we start by defining the variables for the length and width. Let's denote the width of the sandbox as \( w \) feet. According to the problem, the length of the sandbox is twice the width, so we can denote the length as \( 2w \) feet.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]
Substituting the given perimeter and the expressions for the length and width, we get:
\[
30 = 2 \times (2w + w)
\]

Let's simplify the equation:
\[
30 = 2 \times 3w
\]

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for \( w \):
\[
w = \frac{30}{6} = 5
\]

Thus, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

We will let the width be \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the length is twice the width, so the length is \( 2x \) feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \( 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).

Setting the perimeter equal to 30 feet, we have:

\[ 2 \times (2x + x) = 30 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2 \times (3x) = 30 \]
\[ 6x = 30 \]

Then, divide by 6:

\[ x = 5 \]
