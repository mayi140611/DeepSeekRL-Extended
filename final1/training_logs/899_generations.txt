Margaux receives $5 from her friend, $8 from her brother, and $4 from her cousin each day. To find out how much money she will collect after 7 days, we need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by 7.

Daily total = $5 (friend) + $8 (brother) + $4 (cousin)
Daily total = $17 per day

Now, to find the total amount after 7 days:

Total amount = Daily total * Number of days
Total amount = $17 * 7
Total amount = $119

To find out how much money Margaux will collect after 7 days, we need to calculate the daily earnings from each person and sum them up for 7 days.

1. Friend: $5/day * 7 days = $35
2. Brother: $8/day * 7 days = $56
3. Cousin: $4/day * 7 days = $28

Now, add these amounts together to get the total:
$35 (from friend) + $56 (from brother) + $28 (from cousin) = $119

So, Margaux will collect $119 after 7 days.

To find out how much money Margaux will collect after 7 days, we can calculate the total amount collected from each person and then sum them up.

1. From her friend:
   - Her friend pays her $5 per day.
   - After 7 days, the total amount from the friend is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) dollars.

2. From her brother:
   - Her brother pays her $8 per day.
   - After 7 days, the total amount from her brother is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. From her cousin:
   - Her cousin pays her $4 per day.
   - After 7 days, the total amount from the cousin is \(4 \times 7 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add up the amounts from each person:
\[35 + 56 + 28 = 119\]

Therefore, Margaux will collect a total of 119 dollars after 7 days.

To calculate how much money Margaux will collect after 7 days, we need to calculate the daily earnings for each person and then multiply by 7.

For Margaux's friend:
Daily earnings for friend = $5
Total earnings after 7 days = $5 \times 7 = $35

For Margaux's brother:
Daily earnings for brother = $8
Total earnings after 7 days = $8 \times 7 = $56

For Margaux's cousin:
Daily earnings for cousin = $4
Total earnings after 7 days = $4 \times 7 = $28

Now, we add up the total earnings for all three:
Total earnings = $35 + $56 + $28 = $119

Therefore, after 7 days, Margaux will have collected a total of $119.

First, we need to determine the daily amount of money Margaux collects from her friends. Her friend pays her $5 per day, her brother $8 per day, and her cousin $4 per day. We can add these amounts together to find the total amount she collects from one friend each day:
\[ $5 + $8 + $4 = $17 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will collect after 7 days. Since she collects $17 each day, we can multiply that by 7 to find the total amount over 7 days:
\[ 17 \times 7 = 119 \]

So, Margaux will collect $119 after 7 days.

Margaux's total earnings from her friend, brother, and cousin over 7 days can be calculated by adding their daily payments and then multiplying by the number of days. Her friend pays $5 per day, so over 7 days we have $5 * 7 = $35 from her friend. Her brother pays $8 per day, so over 7 days we have $8 * 7 = $56 from her brother. Her cousin pays $4 per day, so over 7 days we have $4 * 7 = $28 from her cousin. To find the total amount she collects, we add the earnings from all three sources: $35 + $56 + $28 = $119.

Margaux receives $5 per day from her friend, $8 per day from her brother, and $4 per day from her cousin. To find out how much money she will collect after 7 days, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from each source and then add them together.

The total amount collected from her friend after 7 days is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) dollars.
The total amount collected from her brother after 7 days is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
The total amount collected from her cousin after 7 days is \(4 \times 7 = 28\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total amount of money collected after 7 days is \(35 + 56 + 28 = 119\) dollars.

To determine how much money Margaux will collect after 7 days, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from each person per day and then sum them up.

- For her friend, who pays $5 per day, the total for 7 days will be \(5 \times 7 = 35\) dollars.
- For her brother, who pays $8 per day, the total for 7 days will be \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- For her cousin, who pays $4 per day, the total for 7 days will be \(4 \times 7 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total money collected after 7 days: \(35 + 56 + 28 = 125\) dollars.

Margaux's friend pays her $5 per day, her brother pays her $8 per day, and her cousin pays her $4 per day. To find out how much she collects after 7 days, we need to calculate the daily total of her earnings and then multiply it by 7.

Daily total of earnings:
- Friend: $5/day
- Brother: $8/day
- Cousin: $4/day

Total daily earnings = $5 + $8 + $4 = $17

After 7 days, the total collection will be:

Total collection after 7 days = Daily total earnings * 7 days
Total collection after 7 days = $17/day * 7 days = $119

Therefore, Margaux will collect $119 after 7 days.

To determine how much money Margaux will collect after 7 days, we need to calculate the total amount collected from each of her friends and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the amount from her friend:**
   - Margaux receives $5 per day from her friend.
   - Over 7 days, the total amount from her friend is:
     \[
     5 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 35 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount from her brother:**
   - Margaux receives $8 per day from her brother.
   - Over 7 days, the total amount from her brother is:
     \[
     8 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 56 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount from her cousin:**
   - Margaux receives $4 per day from her cousin.
   - Over 7 days, the total amount from her cousin is:
     \[
     4 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 28 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Sum the amounts from all her friends:**
   - The total amount collected after 7 days is:
     \[
     35 \, \text{dollars} + 56 \, \text{dollars} + 28 \, \text{dollars} = 129 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

So, Margaux will collect $129 after 7 days.

Margaux's friend pays her $5 per day, which means she will collect \(5 \times 7\) dollars in total after 7 days from her friend.

Margaux's brother pays her $8 per day, which means she will collect \(8 \times 7\) dollars in total after 7 days from her brother.

Margaux's cousin pays her $4 per day, which means she will collect \(4 \times 7\) dollars in total after 7 days from her cousin.

The total amount of money Margaux will collect after 7 days is the sum of the amounts from her friend, brother, and cousin.

\[ \text{Total money} = (5 \times 7) + (8 \times 7) + (4 \times 7) \]

Now we can calculate this sum.
</reasoning>
<answer>
</answer>
<reasoning>
Now let's calculate the total amount of money Margaux will collect from her friend, brother, and cousin. Each person contributes $5, $8, and $4 per day respectively, and she lends money to each for 7 days.

For her friend: 
\[ 5 \times 7 = 35 \]

For her brother: 
\[ 8 \times 7 = 56 \]

For her cousin: 
\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

Now we add these amounts to find the total collection:
\[ 35 + 56 + 28 = 129 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Margaux will collect after 7 days is 129 dollars.

To find out how much money Margaux collects after 7 days, we need to calculate the total amount collected from each of her friends for 7 days.

From her friend:
- Friend pays $5 per day.
- Over 7 days, the friend will pay $5 x 7 = $35.

From her brother:
- Brother pays $8 per day.
- Over 7 days, the brother will pay $8 x 7 = $56.

From her cousin:
- Cousin pays $4 per day.
- Over 7 days, the cousin will pay $4 x 7 = $28.

Now, we add up the amounts from all her friends:
- Total amount from friends = $35 (from her friend) + $56 (from her brother) + $28 (from her cousin) = $119.

Therefore, Margaux will collect a total of $119 after 7 days.

To find out how much money Margaux will collect after 7 days, we need to calculate the total amount collected from her friend, brother, and cousin separately, and then sum them up.

From her friend, she collects $5 per day. So, in 7 days, she will collect:

From her brother, she collects $8 per day. So, in 7 days, she will collect:

From her cousin, she collects $4 per day. So, in 7 days, she will collect:
\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add up the amounts collected from each:
