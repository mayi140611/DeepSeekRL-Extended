To find the combined amount of water leaked from all three holes over a 2-hour time period, we first need to determine the leak rates for each hole:

1. The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.
2. The medium-sized hole leaks at one-half the rate of the largest hole, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \) ounces per minute = 1.5 ounces per minute.
3. The smallest hole leaks at one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 1.5 \) ounces per minute = 0.5 ounces per minute.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water leaked from each hole over a 2-hour period:

1. The largest hole contributes \( 3 \) ounces per minute for 2 hours (which is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) minutes). The total is \( 120 \times 3 = 360 \) ounces.
2. The medium-sized hole contributes \( 1.5 \) ounces per minute for 2 hours (which is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) minutes). The total is \( 120 \times 1.5 = 180 \) ounces.
3. The smallest hole contributes \( 0.5 \) ounces per minute for 2 hours (which is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) minutes). The total is \( 120 \times 0.5 = 60 \) ounces.

The combined amount of water leaked from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is the sum of the water leaked by each hole:
\[ 360 + 180 + 60 = 600 \] ounces.

Therefore, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is \( 600 \) ounces.

To find the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period, we need to calculate the water leakage rate for each hole and then sum them up.

1. **Largest hole**: The rate of water leakage is given as 3 ounces per minute.
   - Over a 2-hour period (120 minutes), the total leakage is \(3 \text{ ounces/minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ ounces}\).

2. **Medium-sized hole**: The rate of water leakage is half the rate of the largest hole.
   - Therefore, the rate is \(3 \text{ ounces/minute} / 2 = 1.5 \text{ ounces/minute}\).
   - Over a 2-hour period, the total leakage is \(1.5 \text{ ounces/minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ ounces}\).

3. **Smallest hole**: The rate of water leakage is one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.
   - Therefore, the rate is \(1.5 \text{ ounces/minute} / 3 = 0.5 \text{ ounces/minute}\).
   - Over a 2-hour period, the total leakage is \(0.5 \text{ ounces/minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ ounces}\).

4. **Combined total leakage**:
   - Adding up the leakage from all three holes, the total amount of water leaked over a 2-hour period is \(360 \text{ ounces} + 180 \text{ ounces} + 60 \text{ ounces} = 600 \text{ ounces}\).

Therefore, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 600 ounces.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the leak rates for each hole.

1. The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces per minute. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the speed of water per minute is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) ounces per hour.
2. The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole. So its rate is \(180 / 2 = 90\) ounces per hour.
3. The smallest hole leaks water at one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole. So its rate is \(90 / 3 = 30\) ounces per hour.

Next, we combine the total leaching over a 2-hour period for each hole:

- For the largest hole, the 2-hour period's total leaking is \(180 \times 2 = 360\) ounces.
- For the medium-sized hole, the 2-hour period's total leaking is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) ounces.
- For the smallest hole, the 2-hour period's total leaking is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) ounces.

Finally, to find the combined amount of water leaking over the 2-hour period, we add the amounts:
\[ 360 + 180 + 60 = 600 \]

Therefore, when it rains, the total amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 600 ounces.

To determine the total amount of water leaked over the 2-hour period, we first need to calculate the water leakage rate for each hole.

1. **Largest hole:**
   - Leaks at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.

2. **Medium-sized hole:**
   - Leaks at one-half the rate of the largest hole.
   - Rate: \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) ounces per minute.

3. **Smallest hole:**
   - Leaks at one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.
   - Rate: \( \frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5 \) ounces per minute.

Next, we find the total amount of water leaked from each hole over the 2-hour period. 

1. **Largest hole:**
   - Rate: 3 ounces per minute
   - Time: 2 hours = 120 minutes
   - Total water leaked: \( 3 \times 120 = 360 \) ounces

2. **Medium-sized hole:**

3. **Smallest hole:**
   - Rate: 0.5 ounces per minute
   - Time: 120 minutes
   - Total water leaked: \( 0.5 \times 120 = 60 \) ounces

Finally, we sum the water leaked from all three holes over the 2-hour period:

\]

\[
\boxed{600}
\]

Thus, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 600 ounces.

First, let's determine the leak rates for each hole in ounces per minute.

The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.

The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole, so this is:
\[ 3 \, \text{ounces/min} \times \frac{1}{2} = 1.5 \, \text{ounces/min} \]

The smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, so this is:
\[ 1.5 \, \text{ounces/min} \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.5 \, \text{ounces/min} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of water leaked from each hole over the 2-hour period. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 2 hours, there are:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} \times 60 \, \text{minutes/hour} = 120 \, \text{minutes} \]

For the largest hole:
\[ 120 \, \text{minutes} \times 3 \, \text{ounces/min} = 360 \, \text{ounces} \]

For the medium-sized hole:
\[ 120 \, \text{minutes} \times 1.5 \, \text{ounces/min} = 180 \, \text{ounces} \]

For the smallest hole:
\[ 120 \, \text{minutes} \times 0.5 \, \text{ounces/min} = 60 \, \text{ounces} \]

The total amount of water leaked from all three holes over the 2-hour period is:
\[ 360 \, \text{ounces} + 180 \, \text{ounces} + 60 \, \text{ounces} = 600 \, \text{ounces} \]

So, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 600 ounces.

To find the combined amount of water leaking from all three holes over a 2-hour time period, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rate of water leakage from each hole.
2. Add the rates to find the total rate of water leakage.
3. Multiply the total rate by the number of minutes in the 2-hour period to get the total amount of water leaked.

**Step 1: Calculate the rate of water leakage from each hole.**

- The largest hole leaks water at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.
- The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole, so its rate is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) ounces per minute.
- The smallest hole leaks water at one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, so its rate is \( \frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5 \) ounces per minute.

**Step 2: Add the rates to find the total rate of water leakage.**

The total rate of water leakage is the sum of the rates from all three holes:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 5 \text{ ounces per minute} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total rate by the number of minutes in the 2-hour period to get the total amount of water leaked.**

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, a 2-hour period is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes. Therefore, the total amount of water leaked is:
\[ 5 \text{ ounces per minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 600 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is \(\boxed{600}\) ounces.

4. **Largest hole total**: 
   \[

Finally, we sum the total amounts from all three holes:

\[
\text{Total combined amount} = 360 \, \text{ounces} + 180 \, \text{ounces} + 60 \, \text{ounces} = 600 \, \text{ounces}
\]

Thus, the combined amount of water leaked from all three holes over a 2-hour period is:

To find the combined amount of water leaked from all three holes over a 2-hour time period, we first need to determine the leak rate for each hole, then calculate the total amount leaked for each hole in one hour, and finally multiply by 2.

1. **Determine the leak rate for each hole:**
   - The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water per minute.
   - The medium-sized hole leaks at one-half the rate of the largest hole. Therefore, the medium-sized hole's leak rate is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ ounces per minute}
     \]
   - The smallest hole leaks at one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole. Therefore, the smallest hole's leak rate is:
     \[
     \frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5 \text{ ounces per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water leaked from each hole in one hour:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the rate of each hole by 60 to find the amount of water leaked in one hour.
   - Largest hole: 
     \[
     3 \text{ ounces/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ ounces}
     \]
   - Medium-sized hole: 
     \[
     1.5 \text{ ounces/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ ounces}
     \]
   - Smallest hole:
     \[
     0.5 \text{ ounces/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Add the amounts leaked from all three holes to find the total amount of water leaked in one hour:**
   \[
   180 \text{ ounces} + 90 \text{ ounces} + 30 \text{ ounces} = 300 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Multiply the total amount leaked in one hour by 2 to find the total amount leaked over a 2-hour period:**
   \[
   300 \text{ ounces/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Therefore, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is \(\boxed{600}\) ounces.

Let's calculate the leak rates for each hole:

1. The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.

2. The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole, which means it leaks at $\frac{1}{2} \times 3 = 1.5$ ounces per minute.

3. The smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, which means it leaks at $\frac{1}{3} \times 1.5 = 0.5$ ounces per minute.

Now, let's find out the total leaks per minute by adding the rates together:
\[3 \text{ ounces (largest hole)} + 1.5 \text{ ounces (medium hole)} + 0.5 \text{ ounces (smallest hole)} = 5 \text{ ounces per minute}.\]

Next, we need to find the total leak over a 2-hour period. First, convert 2 hours into minutes:
\[2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}.\]

Finally, calculate the total leak by multiplying the leak rate per minute by the number of minutes:
\[\text{Total leak} = 5 \text{ ounces per minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 600 \text{ ounces}.\]

So, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 600 ounces.

To find the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour period, let's first calculate the leak rates for each hole.

1. **Largest hole**: 3 ounces per minute
2. **Medium-sized hole**: Half the rate of the largest hole, which is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ ounces per minute}
   \]
3. **Smallest hole**: One-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, which is:
   \[

   \]

Next, we need to convert the 2-hour time period into minutes:
\[
2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, calculate the total amount of water that each hole leaks in 120 minutes:
- Largest hole: \(3 \text{ ounces per minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ ounces}\)
- Medium-sized hole: \(1.5 \text{ ounces per minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ ounces}\)
- Smallest hole: \(1 \text{ ounce per minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ ounces}\)

Finally, sum the amounts leaked by all three holes:
\[
360 \text{ ounces} + 180 \text{ ounces} + 120 \text{ ounces} = 660 \text{ ounces}

To find out the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period, we need to first determine the rate at which each hole leaks water. 

Given:
1. The largest hole leaks water at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.
2. The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole. Therefore, the medium-sized hole leaks at a rate of \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) ounces per minute.
3. The smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole. Therefore, the smallest hole leaks at a rate of \( \frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5 \) ounces per minute.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water leaked from each hole over a 2-hour period.

For the largest hole:
\[ 3 \text{ ounces/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 360 \text{ ounces} \]

For the medium-sized hole:

The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.
The medium-sized hole leaks at one-half the rate of the largest hole, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3 = 1.5 \) ounces per minute.

Now, we sum these leak rates to find the combined amount of water leaked per minute:
\[
3 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 5 \text{ ounces per minute}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of water leaked over a 2-hour period. Since 2 hours is equal to \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes, we multiply the combined leak rate by the total number of minutes:
\[
5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is:
\[
\boxed{600}
\]

To find the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period, we first need to determine the rate of water leakage for each hole.

1. The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.
2. The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole. Therefore, the medium-sized hole leaks at a rate of:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ ounces per minute}
   \]
3. The smallest hole leaks water at one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole. Therefore, the smallest hole leaks at a rate of:
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5 \text{ ounces per minute}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of water leaked from each hole over a 2-hour period. Since 2 hours is equivalent to 120 minutes, we perform the following calculations:

1. For the largest hole:
   \[
   3 \text{ ounces per minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. For the medium-sized hole:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ ounces per minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. For the smallest hole:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ ounces per minute} \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Now, we sum the amounts of water leaked from all three holes:
\[
360 \text{ ounces} + 180 \text{ ounces} + 60 \text{ ounces} = 600 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is \(\boxed{600}\) ounces.
