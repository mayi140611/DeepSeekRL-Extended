Tim buys 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, he buys \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Each egg costs $0.50, so for 36 eggs, the total cost is \(36 \times 0.50 = 18\).

Thus, Tim paid $18 for the eggs.

To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dozens by the number of eggs in each dozen and the cost of each egg.

First, Tim buys 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, Tim buys \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Next, each egg costs $.50. Therefore, the total cost is \(36 \times 0.50 = 18\).

So, Tim paid $18 for the eggs.
