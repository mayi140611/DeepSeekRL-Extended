#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the total number of jelly beans in the jar as \( x \).

According to the information provided, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the jelly beans are red, and \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. This means \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{16} \) of the total jelly beans are coconut flavored.

We are given that 750 jelly beans are coconut flavored. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{3}{16}x = 750 \]

To find the total number of jelly beans, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{750 \times 16}{3} \]
\[ x = \frac{12000}{3} \]
\[ x = 4000 \]

So, there are 4000 jelly beans in the jar.

Let the total number of jelly beans in the jar be denoted as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Three fourths of the jelly beans are red. Hence, the number of red jelly beans is \( \frac{3}{4}x \).
- One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. Thus, the number of coconut flavored red jelly beans is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{3}{16}x \).

We are given that there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans:
\[ \frac{3}{16}x = 750 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{750 \times 16}{3} \]

Calculating the value:
\[ x = \frac{12000}{3} \]
\[ x = 4000 \]

Thus, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is \( 4000 \).

Let's denote the total number of jelly beans in the jar as \( x \). According to the problem, three fourths of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is \( \frac{3}{4}x \).

Next, we know that one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. So, the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{3}{16}x \).

We are given that the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is 750. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{16}x = 750. \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by isolating \( x \):
\[ x = 750 \times \frac{16}{3} = 750 \times \frac{16}{3} = 1000 \times 16 = 16000. \]

So, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is \( \boxed{16000} \).

Let's denote the total number of jelly beans in the jar as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Three fourths of the jelly beans are red.
- One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored.

Given that 750 jelly beans are coconut flavored, we can establish the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \left(\frac{3}{4} \times x\right) = 750
\]

Solving for \( x \):

1. First, simplify the fraction \(\frac{1}{4} \times \left(\frac{3}{4} \times x\right)\):
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} \times x = 750
\]

2. Multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} \):
\[
\frac{3}{16} \times x = 750
\]

3. To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{16}\):
\[
x = 750 \times \frac{16}{3}
\]

4. Simplifying this equation:
\[
x = 750 \times \frac{16}{3} = 1000 \times 16 = 16000
\]

Therefore, there are 16,000 jelly beans in the jar.

Let's denote the total number of jelly beans in the jar as \( J \).

According to the problem, three fourths of the jelly beans are red. This means that the number of red jelly beans is \( \frac{3}{4} J \).

One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. Since there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans, we can write the equation for the number of coconut flavored jelly beans as:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} J = 750 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3}{16} J = 750 \]

To find \( J \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{16} \), which is \( \frac{16}{3} \):
\[ J = 750 \times \frac{16}{3} \]

Calculating the right side, we get:
\[ J = 4000 \]

So, there are 4000 jelly beans in the jar.

Let's denote the total number of jelly beans in the jar by \( N \).

First, we know that three fourths of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is:
\[
\frac{3}{4}N
\]

Next, we are informed that one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. Therefore, the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4}N = \frac{3}{16}N
\]

We are also given that there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans. Thus, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{3}{16}N = 750
\]

To solve for \( N \), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{16} \), which is \( \frac{16}{3} \):
\[
N = 750 \times \frac{16}{3}
\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[
N = 750 \times \frac{16}{3} = 250 \times 16 = 4000
\]

Therefore, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is:
\[

Let's denote the total number of jelly beans in the jar as \( x \).

Since three fourths of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is \( \frac{3}{4}x \).

Out of these red jelly beans, one quarter are coconut flavored. Therefore, the number of coconut flavored red jelly beans is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{3}{16}x \).

We are given that there are 750 coconut flavored red jelly beans. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{3}{16}x = 750 \]

To find \( x \), we can solve this equation:

\[ x = 750 \times \frac{16}{3} \]
\[ x = 200 \times 16 \]
\[ x = 3200 \]

So, there are 3200 jelly beans in the jar.

To determine the total number of jelly beans in the jar, let's follow the reasoning step by step:

1. Let \( T \) be the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
2. According to the problem, three fourths of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is \( \frac{3}{4}T \).
3. One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. Therefore, the number of coconut flavored jelly beans among the red jelly beans is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4}T = \frac{3}{16}T \).
4. We are given that there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans. So, we can set up the equation \( \frac{3}{16}T = 750 \).

Now, let's solve for \( T \):

\[ \frac{3}{16}T = 750 \]

Multiply both sides by \( \frac{16}{3} \):

\[ T = 750 \times \frac{16}{3} \]

\[ T = 250 \times 16 \]

\[ T = 4000 \]

So, there are 4000 jelly beans in the jar.

If one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored and there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans, then the total number of red jelly beans is 750 * 4 = 3000.
If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, then there are 3000 / 3 = 1000 red jelly beans in the jar.
Therefore, there are 1000 + 750 = 1750 jelly beans in the jar.

system
We first set up the equation for the number of coconut flavored jelly beans, expressing it as a fraction of the total number of jelly beans in the jar:
\[ \text{coconut flavored jelly beans} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{jelly beans} \]

Substitute given value and solve:
\[ 750 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{jelly beans} \]
\[ 750 \times 4 = \text{jelly beans} \]
\[ \text{jelly beans} = 3000 \]

Now that we have the quantity of total jelly beans, we can determine the quantity of the red jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans is 3/4 times the total number of the red jelly beans:
\[ \text{jelly beans} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{red jelly beans} \]

Substitute the value of the jelly beans and solve for the number of the red jelly beans:
\[ 3000 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{red jelly beans} \]
\[ 3000 \times \frac{4}{3} = \text{red jelly beans} \]
\[ \text{red jelly beans} = 4000 \]

Now we know the total number of the red jelly beans - 4000 are there, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar. The total number of the jelly beans is given by:
\[ \text{jelly beans} = \text{red jelly beans} + \text{coconut flavored jelly beans} \]

Substitute the value of the red jelly beans and solve:
\[ \text{jelly beans} = 4000 + 750 \]
\[ \text{jelly beans} = 4750 \]

Therefore, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4750.
