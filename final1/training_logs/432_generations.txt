To find out how much Michael earned, we need to calculate the total earnings from large paintings and small paintings separately, and then add them together.

1. Calculate the earnings from large paintings:
\[ \text{Earnings from large paintings} = \text{Price per large painting} \times \text{Number of large paintings sold} \]
\[ \text{Earnings from large paintings} = \$100 \times 5 = \$500 \]

2. Calculate the earnings from small paintings:
\[ \text{Earnings from small paintings} = \text{Price per small painting} \times \text{Number of small paintings sold} \]
\[ \text{Earnings from small paintings} = \$80 \times 8 = \$640 \]

3. Add the earnings from large and small paintings to get the total:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from large paintings} + \text{Earnings from small paintings} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$500 + \$640 = \$1140 \]

To determine how much Michael earned in total, we need to calculate the earnings from the large paintings and the small paintings separately, and then sum them up.

First, calculate the earnings from the large paintings:
\[ \text{Earnings from large paintings} = 5 \text{ paintings} \times \$100/\text{painting} = \$500 \]

Next, calculate the earnings from the small paintings:
\[ \text{Earnings from small paintings} = 8 \text{ paintings} \times \$80/\text{painting} = \$640 \]

Now, add the earnings from both types of paintings to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$500 + \$640 = \$1140 \]

Therefore, Michael earned a total of \$1140.

To find out how much Michael earned in total, we can calculate the earnings from large paintings and small paintings separately and then add them together.

Earnings from large paintings = Number of large paintings × Price per large painting
Earnings from large paintings = 5 × $100
Earnings from large paintings = $500

Earnings from small paintings = Number of small paintings × Price per small painting
Earnings from small paintings = 8 × $80
Earnings from small paintings = $640

Total earnings = Earnings from large paintings + Earnings from small paintings
Total earnings = $500 + $640
Total earnings = $1,140

Let's break it down:
- Michael sells 5 large paintings for $100 each, so that's 5 * $100 = $500 from large paintings.
- He also sells 8 small paintings for $80 each, so that's 8 * $80 = $640 from small paintings.
- To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from large and small paintings together: $500 + $640 = $1140.
