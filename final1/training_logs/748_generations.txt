Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) meters. According to the problem, the length of the rectangle \( l \) is four times its width, so we can express the length as \( l = 4w \).

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula \( A = l \times w \). Substituting the expressions for length and area, we get:

\[ 100 = 4w \times w \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 100 = 4w^2 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:

\[ 25 = w^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[ w = \sqrt{25} \]

\[ w = 5 \]

So, the width of the rectangle is 5 meters. Now, since the length is four times the width:

\[ l = 4 \times 5 \]

\[ l = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 20 meters.

Let the width of the rectangle be denoted by \( w \) meters. According to the information given, the length \( l \) is four times the width, so we can express it as \( l = 4w \).

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula \( A = l \times w \). We are given that the area is 100 square meters, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 100 = 4w \times w \]

Solving further, we get:
\[ 100 = 4w^2 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ 25 = w^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ w = 5 \]

Thus, the width is 5 meters.

Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) and the length as \( l \).

According to the problem, the length is four times the width, so we can write:
\[ l = 4w \]

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = l \times w \]

Given that the area \( A \) is 100 m², we have:
\[ 100 = l \times w \]

Substituting \( l \) with \( 4w \) from the first equation, we get:
\[ 100 = 4w \times w \]
\[ 100 = 4w^2 \]

Now, we can solve for \( w \):
\[ w^2 = \frac{100}{4} \]
\[ w^2 = 25 \]
\[ w = \sqrt{25} \]
\[ w = 5 \] (we take the positive square root because width cannot be negative)

Now that we have the width, we can find the length:
\[ l = 4w \]
\[ l = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ l = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 20 meters.

Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) meters. According to the given information, the length of the rectangle is four times its width, which can be expressed as \( 4w \).

The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Substituting the given values, we have:
\[ 100 = 4w \times w \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 100 = 4w^2 \]

To find \( w \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ w^2 = \frac{100}{4} \]
\[ w^2 = 25 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ w = \sqrt{25} \]
\[ w = 5 \]

Since the length is four times the width:
\[ \text{length} = 4 \times w = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 20 meters.

The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. So, the area is \( 4w \times w = 4w^2 \) square meters.

Given that the area is 100 m², we can set up the equation:

Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) meters. According to the problem, the length of the rectangle is four times its width, which can be expressed as \( 4w \) meters.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is \( 100 \, \text{m}^2 \), we can write:

\[ 100 = 4w \times w \]
\[ 100 = 4w^2 \]

Now, we solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ w^2 = \frac{100}{4} \]
\[ w^2 = 25 \]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[ w = \sqrt{25} \]
\[ w = 5 \, \text{m} \]

Since the length is four times the width, the length is:

\[ \text{Length} = 4 \times w = 4 \times 5 = 20 \, \text{m} \]

Therefore, the length of the rectangle is \( 20 \, \text{m} \).
