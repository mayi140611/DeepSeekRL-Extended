<reasoning>
First, let's calculate the cost of the half of the bricks that are at a discount. The discounted price is $0.50 / 2 = $0.25 per brick. Tom needs half of the 1000 bricks, which is 500 bricks. The cost for these discounted bricks is 500 * $0.25 = $125.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the other half of the bricks that are full price. Since Tom needs the other half of the 1000 bricks, he needs 500 bricks again. The price for each of these full-price bricks is $0.50. Therefore, the cost for these bricks is 500 * $0.50 = $250.

Adding both amounts will give us the total cost:
$125 for the discounted bricks + $250 for the full-price bricks = $375 in total.

Tom needs a total of 1000 bricks. He can buy half of the bricks at a discounted price and the other half at full price.

For the discounted half:
- The price of one brick at 50% off is $0.50 * 0.5 = $0.25
- The number of discounted bricks is 1000 / 2 = 500
- The total cost for the discounted bricks is 500 * $0.25 = $125

For the full-price half:
- The number of full-price bricks is also 500
- The total cost for the full-price bricks is 500 * $0.50 = $250

The total amount spent by Tom is $125 + $250 = $375.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the cost of the bricks Tom needs for his shed. He can buy half of the 1000 bricks at 50% off, and the other half at full price. 

First, calculate the number of bricks Tom can buy at 50% off:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ bricks} \]

Since the price is 50% off, each of these 500 bricks costs half of the original price. The original price for one brick is $0.50, so the discounted price is:
\[ 0.50 \times \frac{1}{2} = $0.25 \]

Next, calculate the cost of these 500 discounted bricks:
\[ 500 \times 0.25 = $125 \]

Now, calculate the number of bricks Tom needs to pay full price for:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ bricks} \]

Since each brick costs $0.50, the cost for these 500 full-price bricks is:
\[ 500 \times 0.50 = $250 \]

Finally, add the costs together to find the total amount Tom spends:
\[ 125 + 250 = $375 \]

Thus, Tom spends $375 in total.

To determine how much Tom spends on the bricks, we need to calculate the cost of the bricks he buys at a discounted price and the cost of the bricks he buys at full price.

1. Calculate the number of bricks Tom buys at half price:
\[ \text{Number of half-price bricks} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

2. Calculate the cost of the half-price bricks:
\[ \text{Cost of half-price bricks} = 500 \times \$0.50 = \$250 \]

3. Calculate the number of bricks Tom buys at full price:
\[ \text{Number of full-price bricks} = 1000 - 500 = 500 \]

4. Calculate the cost of the full-price bricks:
\[ \text{Cost of full-price bricks} = 500 \times \$1.00 = \$500 \]

5. Calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$250 + \$500 = \$750 \]

So, Tom spends a total of \$750.

First, we need to calculate the cost for the half of the bricks that are sold at a discount. They are $0.50 each, but there's a 50% discount, so the price after the discount is $0.50 * 0.5 = $0.25 each. Since half the number of bricks is 1000/2 = 500, the total cost is $0.25 * 500 = $125.
Next, we calculate the cost for the other half of the bricks. They are $0.50 each, so the total cost is $0.50 * 500 = $250.
Adding the two amounts together, Tom spends $125 + $250 = $375. Therefore, Tom spends $375 on the bricks.

To determine how much Tom spends on the bricks, we need to calculate the cost of each half of the bricks and then sum them up.

1. Tom buys half of the bricks for 50% off.
   - Cost per brick: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 0.50 = 0.25 \) dollars.
   - Cost for half of the bricks: \( 0.25 \times 0.5 = 0.125 \) dollars.

2. He pays full price for the other half.
   - Cost per brick: \( 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cost for the other half of the bricks: \( 0.50 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \) dollars.

3. Total cost for all bricks:
   - \( 0.125 + 0.25 = 0.375 \) dollars.

Therefore, Tom spends a total of 0.375 dollars on the bricks.

To determine how many dollars Tom spends, let's break down the problem as follows:

1. **Cost Calculation for 50% Off Bricks:**
   - Tom needs 1000 bricks in total.
   - Half of the bricks (500 bricks) are bought at a 50% discount.
   - The original price per brick is $0.50.
   - Since there's a 50% discount, each brick costs 50% off of $0.50.
   - The discounted price per brick is $0.50 \times 0.50 = $0.25.
   - Therefore, for 500 bricks, the cost is $0.25 \times 500 = $125.

2. **Cost Calculation for Full Price Bricks:**
   - The other half of the bricks (500 bricks) are bought at full price.
   - The full price per brick is $0.50.
   - Therefore, for 500 bricks, the cost is $0.50 \times 500 = $250.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the two parts: $125 (50% off) + $250 (full price) = $375.

So, Tom spends a total of $375.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Tom spends on the bricks. 

First, we calculate the number of bricks he gets at 50% off. Half of the total bricks (1000) is 500. At 50% off, these 500 bricks cost 50% of $0.50, which is $0.50 * 50% = $0.25 each. So, 500 bricks cost 500 * $0.25 = $125.

Next, we calculate the number of bricks he needs to pay full price. The other half of the total bricks is also 500, and each of these bricks costs $0.50. So, 500 bricks cost 500 * $0.50 = $250.

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find out how much Tom spends: $125 + $250 = $375.

Therefore, Tom spends $375 on the bricks.

To determine how much Tommy spends on the bricks, we need to break down the cost of the bricks into two groups: the first group at a discount and the second group at full price.

1. First, calculate the number of bricks at full price and the discount:
   - Half the bricks are at a 50% discount price, so 50% of 1000 bricks are at a discounted price. That's 1000/2 = 500 bricks.
   - The other half (500 bricks) are full price.

2. Calculate the cost for each:
   - At full price, the cost for 500 bricks = 500 * $0.50 = $250.
   - At 50% off, the cost for 500 bricks = 500 * $0.50 * 0.50 = $125.

3. Add the two costs together to get the total:
   - Total cost = full price $250 + 50% off $125 = $250 + $62.50 = $312.50.

So, the total amount spent on the bricks is $312.50.

To determine how many dollars Tom spends, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the bricks bought at a discount and the bricks bought at full price.

1. Calculate the number of half-priced bricks:
   Tom needs 1000 bricks in total, and he can buy half of them, which is 1000 / 2 = 500 bricks.

2. Calculate the cost of the half-priced bricks:
   Each half-priced brick costs 0.50 * 0.50 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 500 half-priced bricks is 500 * $0.25 = $125.

3. Calculate the cost of the full-priced bricks:
   The other half, which is also 500 bricks, must be bought at the full price. Each full-priced brick costs $0.50. Therefore, the cost for 500 full-priced bricks is 500 * $0.50 = $250.

4. Calculate the total cost:
   The total cost is the sum of the cost of the half-priced bricks and the full-priced bricks, which is $125 + $250 = $375.

5. Add up all the costs:
   We need to add the cost of the half-priced bricks and the full-priced bricks, which is $375 + $0.25 (for the first half priced brick that isn't included in the full priced part).

Now let's do the calculation to find the exact total cost.

Tom needs 1000 bricks in total. He can buy 500 bricks at a discounted price and 500 bricks at the full price. 

For the 500 bricks bought at a 50% discount, the discount is $0.50 * 50% = $0.25. So each brick costs $0.50 - $0.25 = $0.25.

For the full price bricks, each costs $0.50.

The cost for the 500 discounted bricks is 500 * $0.25 = $125. 
The cost for the full price bricks is 500 * $0.50 = $250.

Total cost is 125 + 250 = $375.

Thus, Tom spends $375 in total.

To determine how much Tom spends on bricks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, calculate the cost of the bricks for half of the shed:
- Tom needs 1000 bricks in total.
- Half of the bricks is \( \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \) bricks.
- For these 500 bricks, Tom gets 50% off.
- The original price per brick is $0.50.

The cost for the discounted half is:
\[ 500 \times 0.50 \times 0.50 = 125 \times 0.50 = 62.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the cost of the bricks for the other half of the shed:
- Tom only needs 500 bricks because he bought half of the bricks at a discount.
- The full price per brick is $0.50.
- The cost for the full-price half is:
\[ 500 \times 0.50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the costs from both halves to find the total amount Tom spends:
\[ 62.50 + 250 = 312.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Tom spends a total of $312.50.

To determine how much Tom spends on bricks, we need to calculate the cost of half of the bricks at discounted price and the other half at full price.

1. **Calculate the cost of half the bricks at 50% discount:**
   - The discount is on half of the 1000 bricks, which is 100 bricks.
   - The original price for each brick is $0.50.
   - The price after a 50% discount is \(0.50 \times 0.50 = 0.25\) dollars per brick.
   - Cost for 100 bricks is \(100 \times 0.25 = 25\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost for the other half the bricks at full price:**
   - After the first 100 bricks, Tom needs a full price of $0.50 per brick.
   - The remaining half is 500 bricks.
   - Cost for 500 bricks is \(500 \times 0.50 = 250\) dollars.

3. **Add the costs from both parts to find the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 100 bricks + Cost for the remaining 500 bricks.
   - Total cost = \(25\) dollars + \(250\) dollars = \(275\) dollars.

Therefore, Tom spends a total of 275 dollars on bricks.

First, we need to determine how many bricks Tom buys at half price and how many he buys at full price.

- Half the bricks (500) Tom buys at a 50% discount on $0.50. The discount amount is 50% of $0.50, which is $0.25. So the price per brick at the discount is $0.50 - $0.25 = $0.25.
- The other half (500) Tom buys at full price, which is $0.50 each.

The total cost for the discounted half is \( 500 \times \$0.25 \), and the total cost for the full price half is \( 500 \times \$0.50 \).

Let's calculate the total amount spent.

\[
\text{Total cost} = (500 \times 0.25) + (500 \times 0.50)
\]

Next, we calculate the value for the total cost.
</reasoning>
<answer>
\[
\text{Total cost} = (500 \times 0.25) + (500 \times 0.50) = (125 + 250) = 375 \text{ dollars}

Now, summing up the total cost paid for both halves:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 * 375 = 750

Therefore, the total amount Tom spends is 750 dollars.

To determine how much Tom spends on the bricks, we need to break down the cost calculation.

First, calculate the cost of the half of the bricks that are 50% off:
- He needs 1000 bricks in total.
- Half of 1000 is 500 bricks.

The original price of each brick is $0.50. With a 50% discount, the price is \( 0.50 \times 0.5 = $0.25 \).

The cost for 500 bricks at the discounted price is \( 500 \times 0.25 = $125 \).

Next, calculate the cost of the other half of the bricks at full price:
- The other half of 1000 bricks is also 500 bricks.
- At full price, each brick costs $0.50.

The cost for 500 bricks at the full price is \( 500 \times 0.5 = $250 \).

Now, add the two costs together to find the total amount Tom spends:
- Total cost = Cost for 50% off bricks + Cost for full price bricks
- Total cost = $125 + $250 = $375.

Therefore, Tom spends $375 on the bricks.
