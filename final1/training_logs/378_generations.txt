To determine Uki's total earnings for five days, we need to calculate her daily earnings from cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits, and then multiply by five. 

First, calculate her daily earnings:
- Earnings from cupcakes: \(20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$1.50/\text{cupcake} = \$30\)
- Earnings from cookies: \(10 \text{ packets} \times \$2/\text{packet} = \$20\)
- Earnings from biscuits: \(20 \text{ packets} \times \$1/\text{packet} = \$20\)

Total earnings per day:
\[ \$30 + \$20 + \$20 = \$70 \]

Now, calculate her earnings for five days:
\[ \$70 \times 5 = \$350 \]

Therefore, Uki's total earnings for five days will be \(\$350\).

To calculate Uki's total earnings for five days, we need to first calculate her daily earnings from one day's production for cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits.

Daily earnings from cupcakes = Number of cupcakes * Price per cupcake
= 20 * $1.50
= $30

Daily earnings from cookies = Number of packets of cookies * Price per packet
= 10 * $2.00
= $20

Daily earnings from biscuits = Number of packets of biscuits * Price per packet
= 20 * $1.00
= $20

Now, for 5 days, Uki's total earnings will be:

5 * (Earnings from cupcakes + Earnings from cookies + Earnings from biscuits)
= 5 * ($30 + $20 + $20)
= 5 * $70
= $350

Therefore, Uki's total earnings for five days will be $350.

To determine Uki's total earnings for five days, we first need to calculate her daily earnings from selling cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits.

1. **Cupcakes:**
   - Price per cupcake: $1.50
   - Average number of cupcakes baked per day: 20
   - Daily earnings from cupcakes: \( 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$1.50 = \$30 \)

2. **Cookies:**
   - Price per packet of cookies: $2
   - Number of packets of cookies baked per day: 10
   - Daily earnings from cookies: \( 10 \text{ packets} \times \$2 = \$20 \)

3. **Biscuits:**
   - Price per packet of biscuits: $1
   - Number of packets of biscuits baked per day: 20
   - Daily earnings from biscuits: \( 20 \text{ packets} \times \$1 = \$20 \)

Next, we sum up the daily earnings from all items:
   - Total daily earnings: \( \$30 + \$20 + \$20 = \$70 \)

Finally, to find the total earnings for five days:
   - Total earnings for five days: \( 5 \times \$70 = \$350 \)

Therefore, Uki's total earnings for five days will be \( \boxed{350} \) dollars.

To calculate the total earnings per day, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and sum them up. 

For cupcakes: 
\(20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$1.50 = \$30\)

For cookies: 
\(10 \text{ packets} \times \$2 = \$20\)

For biscuits: 
\(20 \text{ packets} \times \$1 = \$20\)

Now, we sum up all earnings: 
\(\$30 + \$20 + \$20 = \$70\)

For five days, the total earnings will be:
\(5 \times \$70 = \$350\)

To calculate Uki's total earnings for five days, we need to first calculate her daily earnings from each type of baked good, and then multiply those by 5 because she earns for 5 days.

1. **Cupcakes**:
   - Price per cupcake: $1.50
   - Number of cupcakes baked per day: 20
   - Daily earnings from cupcakes: \(20 \times \$1.50 = \$30\)

2. **Cookies**:
   - Price per packet of cookies: $2
   - Number of packets of cookies baked per day: 10
   - Daily earnings from cookies: \(10 \times \$2 = \$20\)

3. **Biscuits**:
   - Price per packet of biscuits: $1
   - Number of packets of biscuits baked per day: 20
   - Daily earnings from biscuits: \(20 \times \$1 = \$20\)

Now, letâ€™s sum these earnings:
- Total earnings per day: \(\$30 + \$20 + \$20 = \$70\)

Finally, to find her weekly earnings (for 5 days), we multiply the daily earnings by 5:
- Weekly earnings: \(5 \times \$70 = \$350\)

Therefore, Uki's total earnings for five days are \$350.
