<reasoning>
Let's denote the cost of the magnet as \( M \), the cost of the large sticker as \( S \), and the cost of each stuffed animal as \( T \). We are given that \( M = 3 \) and the relationship between the costs of these items are given as \( M = 3S \), \( M = \frac{1}{4}(T + T) \), and \( M = 3S \).

From \( M = 3S \), substituting the value of \( M \), we get:
\[ 3 = 3S \]
Thus, \( S = 1 \).

Now, using \( M = \frac{1}{4}(T + T) \), we have:
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2T \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}T \]
Solving for \( T \), we find:
\[ T = 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \]

So, a single stuffed animal cost $6.

Let's denote the cost of the sticker ($) as S, the cost of one stuffed animal (S1) as S1, and the cost of the magnet ($3) as $M.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The magnet costs three times more than the sticker: \( M = 3S \)
2. The magnet costs one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined: \( M = \frac{1}{4}(S1 + S1) = \frac{1}{4} \times 2 \times S1 \)

Since we know that \( M = 3 \) dollars, we can plug this into our equations:
\[
3 = 3S \\
3 = \frac{1}{4} \times 2 \times S1
\]

Let's solve the first equation for \( S \):
\[
3 = 3S \\
S = 1
\]

Now, let's solve the second equation for \( S1 \):
\[
3 = \frac{1}{4} \times 2 \times S1 \\
3 = \frac{1}{2}S1 \\
2 \times 3 = S1 \\
S1 = 6
\]

Therefore, a single stuffed animal cost \( \$6 \).

Let's define the cost of the magnet as \( M \), the cost of the sticker as \( S \), and the cost of a single stuffed animal as \( A \). According to the problem, we know \( M = 3 \) dollars. The relationship between the magnet, the sticker, and the two stuffed animals combined is given by:

\[ M = 3S \]
\[ M = \frac{1}{4}(2A) \]

From the first equation, we can substitute \( M = 3 \) into the second equation:

\[ 3 = \frac{1}{4}(2A) \]

Solving for \( A \):

\[ 3 = \frac{2A}{4} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{A}{2} \]

To find the cost of a single stuffed animal, we need to break down the given information and solve the equations step by step.

First, let's denote:
- The cost of the magnet as \( m \)
- The cost of one stuffed animal as \( x \)
- The cost of the sticker as \( s \)

From the problem, we know:
1. \( m = 3 \) (the cost of the magnet)
2. The magnet cost three times more than the sticker: \( m = 3s \)
3. The magnet cost one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined: \( m = \frac{1}{4}(x + x) = \frac{1}{2}x \)

Using these equations, we can solve the system step by step:

1. From \( m = 3s \), we can substitute \( m \) with 3:
\[ 3 = 3s \]
Solving for \( s \):
\[ s = 1 \]

2. Now we know the cost of the magnet \( m = 3 \) and the cost of the sticker \( s = 1 \). Using the second and third equations:
\[ m = \frac{1}{2}x \]
Since \( m = 3 \):
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}x \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Thus, the cost of a single stuffed animal is \( 6 \) dollars.

Let's denote the cost of the magnet as \(M\), the cost of the red horseshoe magnet as \(M_M\), the cost of the first stuffed animal as \(S\), the cost of the second stuffed animal as \(S'\), and the cost of the sticker as \(K\).

Given that the magnet cost \(M_M\) which costs three times the sticker's value, we can write the equation:
\[M = 3K \tag{1}\]

It is also given that the magnet cost one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined, so:
\[M = \frac{1}{4}(S + S') \tag{2}\]

From equation (1), we have:
\[3K = M\]

Given that the magnet cost \(M = 3\) dollars, it follows that:
\[K = \frac{M}{3} = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \text{ dollar}\]

We substitute \(K = 1\) into equation (1) to get:
\[3(1) = M = 3 \text{ dollars}\]

Since the magnet costs $3 dollars, and the magnets cost is three times the sticker's price, we have:
\[M = 3K\]
\[3 = 3(1) \]
\[M = 3\]

Now, substituting \(M = 3\) into equation (2), we find \(S + S'\):
\[3 = \frac{1}{4}(S + S')\]
\[12 = S + S'\]

Thus, the combined value of the two stuffed animals is $12. 

Given that these two stuffed animals are equal in cost (\(S = S'\)), we can denote this cost as \(S\). Therefore:
\[2S = 12\]
\[S = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ dollars}\]

Hence, the cost of a single stuffed animal is \(6\) dollars.

Let's denote the cost of the magnet as \( M \), the cost of the sticker as \( S \), the cost of one stuffed animal as \( A \), and the cost of two stuffed animals as \( 2A \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The magnet cost three times more than the sticker, so \( M = 3S \).
2. The magnet cost one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined, so \( M = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2A \).

Since we know the magnet cost $3, we can substitute \( M \) in both equations:
\[ 3 = 3S \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2A \]

First, solve for \( S \):
\[ 3 = 3S \]
\[ S = 1 \]

Next, solve for \( A \):
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2A \]
\[ 3 = \frac{2A}{4} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{A}{2} \]
\[ 6 = A \]

So, the cost of a single stuffed animal is \( \$6 \).

Now we will reason that in answering the question, we need to find the cost of a single stuffed animal considering the information provided.

Let's summarize this reasoning:

1. Let \( S = 1 \) (from the magnet sticker comparison).
2. Then \( A = 6 \) (from double stuffed animals together).

So, a single stuffed animal costs \$6.

To determine the cost of a single stuffed animal, we first need to establish the prices of the other items based on the information given.

1. The magnet costs $3. The magnet costs three times more than the sticker. Therefore, if the magnet costs $3, the sticker costs $1 (because $3 / 3 = $1).

2. The magnet also costs one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined. Therefore, the combined cost of the two stuffed animals is $12 (because $3 * 4 = $12).

3. Since the magnet and the sticker total $4 (because $3 + $1 = $4), the cost of the two stuffed animals must be $4. Therefore, each stuffed animal costs $2 (because $4 / 2 = $2).

So, a single stuffed animal cost $2.

2. \(M = 3T\) (The magnet cost three times more than the sticker)
3. \(M = \frac{S}{4}\) (The magnet cost one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined)

Let's start solving the equations step by step.

First, from the second equation \(M = 3T\), we can express \(T\) in terms of \(M\):
\[T = \frac{M}{3}\]

Given that \(M = 3\), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[T = \frac{3}{3} = 1\]

Next, we use the third equation \(\frac{S}{4} = M\):
\[S = 4M\]

Given that \(M = 3\), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[S = 4 \times 3 = 12\]

Therefore, the cost of a single stuffed animal is \(12\) dollars.

2. \( M = 3S \) (The magnet cost is three times more than the sticker)
3. \( M = \frac{1}{4}(2A) \) (The magnet's cost is one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined)

To find the cost of a single stuffed animal, let's use the given information and set up the equations.

Let \( x \) represent the cost of the large sticker, which is $3.

The magnet cost is three times more than the sticker, so the equation for the magnet's cost is:
\[
\text{Magnet cost} = 3 \times \text{Sticker cost} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]
But the magnet actually cost $3, so we need to reverse this relationship to find the sticker cost:
\[
\text{Sticker cost} = \frac{\text{Magnet cost}}{3} = \frac{3}{3} = 1
\]

Next, the magnet costs one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined. Let \( y \) represent the cost of one stuffed animal. Then the combined cost of two stuffed animals is \( 2y \). The equation is:
\[
\text{Magnet cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Combined cost of two stuffed animals}
\]
Substituting the known magnet cost:
\[
3 = \frac{1}{4} \times 2y
\]
Simplifying for \( y \):
\[
3 = \frac{1}{2}y
\]
\[
y = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]
So, a single stuffed animal cost $6.

Now, let's consider the second item, the large sticker: \( x = 1 \) dollar.

Therefore, the cost of a single stuffed animal is:
\[
\boxed{6}

To determine the cost of a single stuffed animal, we start by understanding the relationships between the prices of the items.

Given:
1. The magnet costs $3.
2. The magnet costs three times more than the sticker.
3. The magnet costs one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined.

Let's set up the equations based on the information provided.

First, since the magnet costs three times more than the sticker:
\[ \text{Sticker Price} = \frac{\text{Magnet Price}}{3} = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, let's determine the combined price of the two stuffed animals:
\[ \text{Price of two stuffed animals} = 4 \times \text{Sticker Price} = 4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the magnet costs one quarter of the price of the two stuffed animals combined:
\[ \text{Magnet Price} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Price of two stuffed animals} = \frac{1}{4} \times 4 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

This confirms that the magnet's price (already calculated as $3) aligns with the given relationship to the sticker and the combined price of the two stuffed animals.

Now, we need to find the price of a single stuffed animal:
\[ \text{Price of one stuffed animal} = \frac{\text{Price of two stuffed animals}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the price of a single stuffed animal is \(\boxed{2}\) dollars.
