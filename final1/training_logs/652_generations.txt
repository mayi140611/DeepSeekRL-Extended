system
<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of books Flo wrote as \( F \). According to the problem, Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo. Therefore, Zig wrote \( 4F \) books.

We are given that Zig wrote 60 books. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4F = 60 \]

To find the number of books Flo wrote, we solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Now, to find the total number of books they wrote together, we add the number of books Zig wrote to the number of books Flo wrote:
\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \]

So, Zig and Flo wrote a total of 75 books.

Let's denote the number of books Flo wrote as \( F \).

According to the problem, Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Zig's books} = 4 \times \text{Flo's books} \]

We are given that Zig wrote 60 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4F = 60 \]

To find the number of books Flo wrote, we solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

So, Flo wrote 15 books.

The total number of books written by both Zig and Flo is:
\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Zig's books} + \text{Flo's books} \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 60 + 15 = 75 \]

Thus, they wrote a total of 75 books.

If Zig wrote 60 books and this is four times as many as Flo wrote, we can find out how many books Flo wrote by dividing Zig's number of books by 4. So, Flo wrote \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) books.

To find the total number of books Zig and Flo wrote altogether, we add Zig's books to Flo's books: \( 60 + 15 = 75 \).

Therefore, Zig and Flo wrote 75 books altogether.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####

<reasoning>
To determine the total number of books written by Zig and Flo, we start by identifying the number of books Flo wrote. We know that Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo. If Zig wrote 60 books, then the number of books Flo wrote is:

\[ \text{Number of books Flo wrote} = \frac{\text{Number of books Zig wrote}}{4} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books written by both Zig and Flo by adding the number of books Zig wrote to the number of books Flo wrote:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \text{Number of books Zig wrote} + \text{Number of books Flo wrote} = 60 + 15 = 75 \]

So, Zig and Flo wrote a total of 75 books.

To find out how many books Flo wrote, we first need to determine the number of books Zig wrote, which is given as 60. 

Given that Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo, we can set up the following equation:  
\[ 4 \times \text{Flo's books} = 60 \]
\[ \text{Flo's books} = \frac{60}{4} \]

Next, we calculate the number of books Flo wrote:
\[ \text{Flo's books} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

So, Flo wrote 15 books. To find the total number of books they wrote together, we add Zig's and Flo's books:

\[ \text{Total books} = Zig's books + Flo's books = 60 + 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they wrote together is:
\[ \text{Total books} = 75 \]

Let's begin by defining the quantities involved in the problem:

1. Let \( F \) represent the number of books Flo wrote.
2. Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo, which can be expressed as \( 4F \).

Given that Zig wrote 60 books, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 4F = 60 \]

To find out how many books Flo wrote, we solve for \( F \):

\[ F = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Now that we know Frieda wrote 15 books, we can find out how many books they wrote altogether by adding the number of books each of them wrote:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Zig's books} + \text{Flo's books} = 60 + 15 = 75 \]

So, Zig and Flo wrote a total of 75 books.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of books Flo wrote as \( F \). According to the problem, Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo. We know Zig wrote 60 books.

From the information provided, we can write the equation:
\[ 4F = 60 \]

To find \( F \), we solve for \( F \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{60}{4} \]
\[ F = 15 \]

So, Flo wrote 15 books.

Now, to find the total number of books written by both Zig and Flo, we add the number of books Zig wrote to the number Flo wrote:
\[ \text{Total} = 60 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 75 \]

Therefore, Zig and Flo wrote 75 books altogether.

If Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo, then if we let Flo's number of books be represented by \( F \), then Zig's number of books can be represented as \( 4F \). 

According to the problem, Zig wrote 60 books, so \( 4F = 60 \). We can solve this equation to find the number of books Flo wrote.

\[ 4F = 60 \]
\[ F = \frac{60}{4} \]
\[ F = 15 \]

So Flo wrote 15 books. To find out how many books Zig and Flo wrote altogether, we add their numbers of books:

\[ Zig's \ books + Flo's \ books = 60 + 15 \]

\[ = 60 + 15 \]
\[ = 75 \]

Therefore, Zig and Flo wrote 75 books altogether.

Let's break down the steps to find out the total number of books written by Zig and Flo:

1. We are told that Zig wrote 60 books.
2. Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo, so Flo must have written \( \frac{60}{4} \) books.
3. Calculating the number of books Flo wrote: \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) books.

Now we have the number of books each of them wrote:
- Zig: 60 books
- Flo: 15 books

To find the total number of books they wrote altogether, we add the number of books each wrote:
- Total books \( = Zig's\ number\ of\ books + Flo's\ number\ of\ books \)
- Total books \( = 60 + 15 \)
- Total books \( = 75 \)

Therefore, the total number of books they wrote together is 75.

To find out how many books Flo wrote, we'll start by dividing the number of books Zig wrote by 4, since Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo.

Given that Zig wrote 60 books, we have:
Flo's books = Zig's books / 4
Flo's books = 60 / 4
Flo's books = 15

Now, to find the total number of books written by Zig and Flo together, we add Zig's books to Flo's books:

Total books = Zig's books + Flo's books
Total books = 60 + 15
Total books = 75

So, Zig and Flo wrote a total of 75 books together.

To find out how many books Flo wrote, we can start with the fact that Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo. If Zig wrote 60 books, then the number of books Flo wrote can be calculated by dividing Zig's total by 4.

So, if Zig wrote 60 books and that is four times Flo's total, we can calculate Flo's total as:
\[ \text{Flo's total} = \frac{\text{Zig's total}}{4} \]

Once we have Flo's total, we can then find the combined total number of books written by both Zig and Flo by adding their individual totals together.

Let's denote the number of books Flo wrote as \( F \).

According to the information given, Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo. So, we can write this relationship as:
\[ \text{Zig's books} = 4 \times \text{Flo's books} \]
\[ 60 = 4 \times F \]

We need to find the value of \( F \) and then add it to the number of books Zig wrote to get the total.

\[ F = \frac{60}{4} \]
\[ F = 15 \]

Thus, Flo wrote 15 books. To find the total number of books written by both, we add Zig's and Flo's books together:
\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Zig's books} + \text{Flo's books} \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 60 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 75 \]

Therefore, the total number of books written by Zig and Flo is 75.
