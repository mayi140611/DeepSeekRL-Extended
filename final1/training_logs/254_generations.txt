###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Nate got lost looking for his car in the airport parking lot. He had to walk through every row in Section G and Section H to find it. Section G has 15 rows that each hold 10 cars. Section H has 20 rows that each hold 9 cars. If Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, how many minutes did he spend searching the parking lot?

system
To find out how many minutes Nate spent searching the parking lot, we first need to calculate the total number of cars in each section.

For Section G:
\( 15 \, \text{rows} \times 10 \, \text{cars/row} = 150 \, \text{cars} \)

For Section H:
\( 20 \, \text{rows} \times 9 \, \text{cars/row} = 180 \, \text{cars} \)

Now, Add the numbers of cars in both sections to get the total number of cars:
\( 150 \, \text{cars} + 180 \, \text{cars} = 330 \, \text{cars} \)

Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute. To find the total time he spent searching:
\( \frac{330 \, \text{cars}}{11 \, \text{cars/minute}} = 30 \, \text{minutes} \)

The number of cars in Section G is 15 rows * 10 cars/row = 150 cars. The number of cars in Section H is 20 rows * 9 cars/row = 180 cars. The total number of cars in both sections is 150 cars + 180 cars = 330 cars. Nate walks past 11 cars per minute, so it takes him 330 cars / 11 cars/minute = 30 minutes to search the parking lot.

Nate walked through Section G: 15 rows * 10 cars/row = 150 cars.
He walked through Section H: 20 rows * 9 cars/row = 180 cars.
Total cars Nate walked past: 150 cars + 180 cars = 330 cars.

To find the total time Nate spent searching, we use:
330 cars / 11 cars/minute = 30 minutes.

Nate has to walk through 15 rows in Section G, which is 15 * 10 = 150 cars in total. In Section H, he has to walk 20 rows * 9 cars = 180 cars. Adding both sections, the total cars Nate walked past are 150 + 180 = 330 cars. Since he can walk past 11 cars per minute, he spent 330 / 11 = 30 minutes searching the parking lot.

To calculate the total number of cars Nate has to walk past, we multiply the number of rows by the number of cars in each row for both sections:
For Section G: 15 rows * 10 cars/row = 150 cars
For Section H: 20 rows * 9 cars/row = 180 cars

The total number of cars is 150 cars + 180 cars = 330 cars.

Since Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, the total time spent searching the parking lot is 330 cars / 11 cars/minute = 30 minutes.

Nate walked through Section G, which had 15 rows with 10 cars each, resulting in the total number of cars in Section G being 150. Similarly, Nate walked through Section H, which had 20 rows with 9 cars each, resulting in the total number of cars in Section H being 180. Thus the total number of cars Nate had to walk past in the two sections was 150+180 = 330 cars.

Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, so if he had to walk past 330 cars, he spent 330/11=30 minutes searching the parking lot.

First, we calculate the total number of cars in Section G:

Next, we calculate the total number of cars in Section H:
\[ 20 \text{ rows} \times 9 \text{ cars/row} = 180 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we find the total number of cars in both sections:
\[ 150 \text{ cars} + 180 \text{ cars} = 330 \text{ cars} \]

Since Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, we calculate the total time spent walking:
\[ \frac{330 \text{ cars}}{11 \text{ cars/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cars in Section H. Section H has 20 rows with 9 cars each, so the total number of cars in Section H is:
\[ 20 \times 9 = 180 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the cars from both sections gives the total number of cars Nate needed to check:
\[ 150 + 180 = 330 \text{ cars} \]

Since Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, the time he spent searching the parking lot is:
