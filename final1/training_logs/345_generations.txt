#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To calculate how much Adam will have earned after taxes after 30 days of work, we first calculate his initial earnings for those days and then subtract 10% for taxes.

Adam's daily earnings = $40
Number of days = 30

Total initial earnings = Daily earnings × Number of days
Total initial earnings = $40 × 30 = $1,200

10% of his initial earnings is deducted as taxes
10% of $1,200 = 0.10 × $1,200 = $120

So, the amount deducted as taxes is $120, and the amount after deductions is:
Total initial earnings - Taxes = $1,200 - $120 = $1,080

Therefore, after taxes, Adam will have earned $1,080 after 30 days of work.

First, we need to calculate Adam's daily earnings after taxes are deducted.
10% of $40 is $40 * 0.10 = $4
So his daily earnings after taxes is $40 - $4 = $36
Now we can calculate his total earnings after 30 days of work.
$36 * 30 days = $1,080

Adam earns $40 daily, so after 30 days, he will earn 30 * $40 = $1200.
10% of his money is deducted as taxes, so Adam will have to pay $1200 * 0.1 = $120.
Therefore, Adam will have $1200 - $120 = $1080 after taxes after 30 days of work.

First, calculate Adam's earnings before taxes for 30 days: $40/daily * 30 days = $1200 total earnings. Then find 10% of his earnings: 10/100 * $1200 = $120. Subtract this from his total earnings: $1200 - $120 = $1080 after taxes.

To calculate how much money Adam will have earned after taxes after 30 days of work, we first need to calculate how much money is deducted as taxes in one day, and then multiply that by 30. We do this by 10% of $40, and then we multiply that product by 30.
$40 * 10% = $4
$4 * 30 = $120
So, Adam will have earned $120 after taxes after 30 days of work.

First, calculate Adam's earnings before taxes for one day, which is $40. Then, calculate the amount of money deducted as taxes, which is 10% of $40, i.e., $40 * 10/100 = $4. Subtract the taxes from Adam's earnings for one day to get the net amount earned after taxes, i.e., $40 - $4 = $36.

Now multiply Adam's net earnings after taxes per day by the number of days worked to get his total earnings for 30 days, i.e., $36 * 30 = $1080.

<answer>
1080
</answer>
<reasoning>
Adam's earnings before taxes for 30 days is calculated as the daily earnings, $40, multiplied by the number of days worked, which is 30. So his total earnings before taxes for 30 days is $40 * 30 = $1200.

Adam then pays 10% in taxes. Therefore, the amount deducted as taxes from his total earnings is 10% of $1200, or $1200 * 10/100 = $120.

Finally, subtract the taxes from his total earnings to get his earnings after taxes, which is $1200 - $120 = $1080.

To calculate the exact amount Adam will earn after taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money deducted as taxes in one day:
\[ \text{Taxes per day} = 10\% \times 40 = 0.10 \times 40 \]

2. Calculate the amount deducted as taxes over a 30-day period:
\[ \text{Taxes for 30 days} = 0.10 \times 40 \times 30 \]

3. Subtract the total taxes from Adam's daily earnings to find his net earnings after taxes:
\[ \text{Net earnings after 30 days} = 40 - 0.10 \times 40 \times 30 \]

Now, let's calculate:
\[ \text{Taxes for 30 days} = 0.10 \times 40 \times 30 = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

\[ \text{Net earnings after 30 days} = 40 - 120 = -80 \]

So, after 30 days of work, Adam will have earned $-80, indicating that he's actually in the red by $80 due to the taxes deducted.

-80

1. Calculate how much Adam earns daily after taxes by multiplying his daily earnings by the percentage deducted as taxes (10%). This gives us:
   \[
   40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, after taxes, Adam earns $4 less each day.

2. Calculate Adam's total earnings after taxes over a 30-day period by subtracting the daily after-tax earnings from his total earnings. Adam's total earnings over 30 days is:
   \[
   30 \times 40 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   
3. Subtract the total amount deducted as taxes over 30 days from Adam's total earnings:
   \[
   1200 - (30 \times 4) = 1200 - 120 = 1080 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. If Adam's earnings represent his income which is taxed at a rate of 10%, we could determine his total tax at the end of 30 days. His total tax at the end of 30 days is:
   \[
   1200 \times 0.10 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Therefore, in summary, after deducting the taxes for the 30 days, Adam's amount of earnings will be:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} + \text{Total Taxes} = 1080 + 120 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Adam’s amount of earning after the taxes will be:
   1200 dollars.

To calculate how much money Adam will have earned after taxes after 30 days of work, we first need to determine how much money is deducted as taxes from his daily earnings.

Adam's daily earnings: 
$40

Tax rate: 
10% 

Taxed amount per day:
$40 * 10% = $4

Now, we multiply the daily taxed amount by the number of days Adam works to get the total amount deducted as taxes:

Total amount deducted as taxes:
$4 * 30 = $120

Finally, we subtract the total amount deducted as taxes from Adam's daily earnings to find his total earnings after taxes:

Total earnings after taxes:
$40 + $4 - $120 = -$76

This result indicates that after taxes, Adam will have lost $76, not gained any money. Therefore, Adam will not have any money left after taxes for 30 days of work.

$-76

To calculate the total earnings after taxes, we first need to determine how much is deducted in taxes and then subtract this from the total earnings.

1. Adam earns $40 daily.
2. 10% of his daily earnings are taxed, so the tax amount per day is 10/100 * $40 = $4.
3. Over 30 days, the total tax deducted is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. Adam's total earnings for 30 days is $40 * 30 = $1200.
5. After deducting the taxes, Adam's remaining earnings are $1200 - $120 = $1080.

So the answer is $1080.

First, we calculate Adam's daily earnings after taxes, which is 90% of his original daily earnings because 10% is deducted for taxes.

Original daily earnings: $40
Percentage deducted for taxes: 10% = 0.10

Daily earnings after taxes: $40 - ($40 * 0.10) = $40 - $4 = $36

Now, we calculate Adam's total earnings after 30 days.

Total earnings: $36 (daily earnings after taxes) * 30 days = $1,080

Therefore, Adam will have earned $1,080 after taxes after 30 days of work.

To calculate the amount of money Adam will have after taxes after 30 days of work, we first need to calculate his daily earnings after taxes.

Adam earns $40 daily. 10% of his earnings are deducted as taxes.

Daily earnings after taxes = Daily earnings - (Daily earnings * Tax rate)

Daily earnings after taxes = $40 - ($40 * 10%)

Daily earnings after taxes = $40 - ($40 * 0.10)

Daily earnings after taxes = $40 - $4

Daily earnings after taxes = $36

Now, we calculate the total earnings after taxes for 30 days.

Total earnings after taxes = Daily earnings after taxes * Number of days

Total earnings after taxes = $36 * 30

Total earnings after taxes = $1,080

Therefore, after 30 days of work, Adam will have earned $1,080 after taxes.
