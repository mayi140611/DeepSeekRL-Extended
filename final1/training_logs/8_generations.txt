###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?

Let's first calculate the total amount Alexis spent on the items she remembered buying:

Button-up shirt: $30
Suit pants: $46
Suit coat: $38
Socks: $11
Belt: $18

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$30 (shirts) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt) = $143

Alexis had a budget of $200 and has $16 left after all her purchases, so we can subtract the remaining budget from the total spent to find out how much she paid for the shoes:

$200 (budget) - $16 (remaining) = $184

This $184 should be the same as the total amount she spent minus the amount she spent on the shoes, which we've already calculated as $143:

$184 (total spent) - $143 (items spent) = $41 (shoes)

So, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.

Alexis spent a total of $30 (shirt) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt) = $153 on the items that she had receipts for.

She has $16 left from her budget, so the total she spent on her clothes (including the shoes) is $200 - $16 = $184.

Thus, the amount Alexis paid for the shoes is $184 - $153 = $31.

Therefore, the answer is $31.

To determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, let's first calculate the total amount she spent on the other items.

She spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. Adding these amounts together:

$30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

After spending $143 on these items, Alexis has $16 left from her $200 budget. To find out how much she spent on the shoes, we subtract the remaining amount from the total budget:

$200 - $16 = $184

This means Alexis spent $184 in total on her new business clothes, which includes the shoes. We know the cost of the other items, so we subtract that from $184 to find the cost of the shoes:

$184 - $143 = $41

Therefore, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.

Let's calculate the total amount Alexis spent on the items she remembers. She spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. 

Adding these up:
$30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

She started with a budget of $200 and has $16 left from her budget, so let's calculate how much she spent in total before her last purchase:

$200 - $16 = $184

Subtracting the amount she used for the items she remembered from the total spent ($184 - $143 = $41), we can find out how much she paid for the shoes:

$41 = $41

Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.

Alexis spent $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143 on other items combined, before the shoes. She has $16 left in her budget, which means the total cost of her other items was $200 - $16 = $184. This amount corresponds exactly to the amount Alexis paid for the shoes, as the total cost for everything was exactly $200.

Therefore, she paid $184 for the shoes.

Let's calculate the total amount spent on the button-up shirt, suit pants, suit coat, and socks first:

Button-up shirt: $30
Suit pants: $46
Suit coat: $38
Socks: $11

Total spent (excluding shoes): $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 = $125

Alexis had a budget of $200, and she has $16 left after her purchases. Therefore, the amount she spent in total is:

Budget - remaining amount = total spent
$200 - $16 = $184

Now, we know that $125 has already been spent on the first four items, so we can subtract that from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on the shoes:

$184 - $125 = $59

Therefore, Alexis paid $59 for the shoes.

Let's break down the cost of the items Alexis bought and subtract it from her budget to find out how much she spent on the shoes.

1. Button-up shirt: $30
2. Suit pants: $46
3. Suit coat: $38
4. Socks: $11
5. Belt: $18

We can add up the cost of these items and subtract it from her budget of $200 to find out the cost of the shoes.

Calculation:

$30 (shirt) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt) = $143

Now, subtract this from her budget:

$200 - $143 = $57

So, Alexis paid $57 for the shoes.

To determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we start by calculating the total amount she spent on the other items and then subtract this from her initial budget.

First, we sum the costs of the items she absolutely spent money on:
\[
30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
30 + 46 = 76
\]
\[
76 + 38 = 114
\]
\[
114 + 11 = 125
\]
\[
125 + 18 = 143
\]

So, Alexis spent $143 on the button-up shirt, suit pants, suit coat, socks, and belt.

Next, we subtract this total from her initial budget of $200 to find out how much she had left:
\[
200 - 143 = 57
\]

According to the information provided, she has $16 left from her budget. This discrepancy indicates there might be an error. However, based on the given values, she spent $143 and has $16 left. 

Therefore, the amount Alexis paid for the shoes is also $143. 

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{143}
\]

Alexis has a total budget of $200 and spent $123 on the other items ($30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18), so she had $200 - $123 = $77 left before she bought the shoes.
Alexis has $16 left from her budget, so she paid $77 - $16 = $61 for the shoes.

To determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we first need to calculate the total amount she spent on the other items and then subtract that from her initial budget.

1. **Total items spent:** $30 (shirt) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt) = $143
2. **Budget:** $200

Now we subtract the total spent ($143) from the budget ($200) to find out how much was left after this purchase.

3. **Amount left:** $200 - $143 = $57

However, the problem states that she has $16 left from her budget, not $57. This discrepancy suggests an additional $41 that was not accounted for in the calculation ($57 - $16 = $41).

Therefore:
- The total amount spent on the shoes is $41 (as it is the difference between the amount left ($16) and what was initially spent ($57)).

Thus, Alexis paid **$41 for the shoes**.

Let's calculate the total amount Alexis spent on the clothes excluding the shoes first:
- Button-up shirt: $30
- Suit pants: $46
- Suit coat: $38
- Socks: $11
- Belt: $18

Total for these items = $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

Alexis has a budget of $200 and has $16 left after all her purchases. So, to find out how much she spent in total, we subtract the remaining $16 from her budget:
Total spent = Budget - Remaining amount = $200 - $16 = $184

Now, let's find out how much she paid for the shoes by subtracting the cost of the other items from the total amount she spent:
Total spent for the shoes = Total spent - Total for other items = $184 - $143 = $41

Therefore, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.

Let's calculate the total amount Alexis spent on the items we know:

1. Button-up shirt: $30
2. Suit pants: $46
3. Suit coat: $38
4. Socks: $11
5. Belt: $18

Now, add these amounts together:

$30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

Alexis started with a budget of $200 and had $16 left over after her shopping, so she spent:

$200 - $16 = $184

So, the total amount spent on the items, including the shoes, is $143 (known items) + $184 (remaining) = $327.

Since Alexis spent $184 out of $200 and had $16 left, we can calculate the cost of the shoes as follows:

Total cost = Budgeted amount + Remaining money after shopping
$327 = $200 + $16
$327 = $216

Therefore, the cost of the shoes is $327 - $216 = $111.

Alexis paid $111 for the shoes.

To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we can start by adding up the cost of all the items Alexis bought, including shoes:

Button-up shirt: $30
Suit pants: $46
Suit coat: $38
Socks: $11
Belt: $18
Total without shoes: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

Alexis started with a budget of $200 and has $16 left after her purchase. Therefore, she spent $200 - $16 = $184 on all items.

Now, we subtract the cost of items excluding shoes from the total amount spent to find out how much Alexis paid for the pair of shoes:

$184 (total spent) - $143 (total of items excluding shoes) = $41

Therefore, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.

To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we can start by calculating the total amount she spent on all the other items and then subtract that from her initial budget.

Total amount spent on the other items:
Button-up shirt: $30
Suit pants: $46
Suit coat: $38
Socks: $11
Belt: $18

Total: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

Now, we know that after buying all these items, Alexis had $16 left from her $200 budget. This means the total amount she spent was:

$200 - $16 = $184

Since we know she spent $143 on the items mentioned, the remaining amount must have been spent on the shoes.

Total spent on the shoes: $184 (total spent) - $143 (spent on other items) = $41

Therefore, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.
