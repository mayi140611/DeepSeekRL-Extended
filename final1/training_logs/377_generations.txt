The first two CDs are 1.5 hours each, so together they are 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours.
The last CD is twice as long as the other two, so it is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours.
The combined length of all three CDs is 3 + 3 = 6 hours.

To find the combined length of the CDs, we need to calculate the total length of the three CDs.

1. The first two CDs are each 1.5 hours long. Therefore, the combined length of the first two CDs is:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. The third CD is twice as long as one of the first two CDs. Since each of the first two CDs is 1.5 hours, the third CD is:
   \[
   2 \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Now, we add the lengths of all three CDs together:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the combined length of the three CDs is 9 hours.

9 hours

The last CD is twice the length of each of the first two CDs combined. The first two CDs are 1.5 hours each, so:

1.5 hours - CD 2
1.5 hours Ã— 2  
3 hours - CD 3

The combined length of the CDs is:

1.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the combined length of the CDs, we need to calculate the length of each CD separately and then add them together.

1. The first two CDs are each 1.5 hours long.
2. The third CD is twice as long as one of the first two CDs, which means it is 1.5 hours * 2 = 3 hours long.

Now we add the lengths of all the CDs together:

1.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

Therefore, the combined length of the CDs is 6 hours.

To find the combined length of the CDs, we first need to calculate the length of the last CD, which is twice the length of the other two CDs.

The length of each of the first two CDs is 1.5 hours. Therefore, the length of the last CD is \(1.5 \times 2 = 3\) hours.

The combined length of the first two CDs is \(1.5 + 1.5 = 3\) hours.

Adding the length of the last CD, we get the total length of all three CDs: \(3 + 3 = 6\) hours.

First, we calculate the length of the last CD, which is twice the length of a 1.5-hour CD. This gives us \(2 \times 1.5 = 3\) hours. 

Next, we add the lengths of the first two CDs together, which is \(1.5 + 1.5 = 3\) hours.

Finally, we add the length of the last CD to the combined length of the first two CDs: \(3 + 3 = 6\) hours.

To find the combined length of the CDs, we first need to determine the length of the last CD. Since the last CD is twice as long as one of the 1.5-hour CDs, it is 1.5 hours * 2 = 3 hours long.

Now that we know the lengths of all three CDs, we can add them together: 1.5 hours (second CD) + 1.5 hours (first CD) + 3 hours (third CD) = 6 hours.

The first two CDs are 1.5 hours each, so their combined length is 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 hours.
The last CD is twice as long as the first two, so it is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours.

To find the combined length of all three CDs, we simply add up their individual lengths: 3 (length of first two CDs) + 3 (length of last CD) = 6 hours.

To find the combined length of the CDs, we need to calculate the length of each CD and then add them together.

The first two CDs are each 1.5 hours long. So, the total length of the first two CDs is 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 3 hours.

The third CD is twice as long as the first two CDs, which means it is 2 * 1.5 hours = 3 hours long.

Now, we add the lengths of all three CDs:

3 hours (from the first two CDs) + 3 hours (from the third CD) = 6 hours.

So, the combined length of the CDs is 6 hours.

The combined length of the CDs is 7.5 hours.

To find the combined length of the CDs, we need to add the lengths of each CD.

For the first two CDs, we know each is 1.5 hours long:
\[ 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The third CD is twice as long as one of the first two CDs, so:
\[ 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Adding the lengths of all three CDs together:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the combined length of the CDs is 6 hours.
