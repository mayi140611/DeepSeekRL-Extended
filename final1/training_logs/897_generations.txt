<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how much Sandi spent at the farmer's market. Since Sandi had $600 and spent half of it at the market, Sandi spent:
\[ 600 / 2 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Gillian spent at the farmer's market. The problem states that Gillian spent $150 more than three times the total amount that Sandi spent. Thus, Gillian's total spending can be calculated as:
\[ 3 \times 300 + 150 \]

Substituting the known values into the equation:
\[ 3 \times 300 = 900 \]
\[ 900 + 150 = 1050 \]

So, Gillian spent $1050 at the farmer's market.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Gillian spent at the farmer's market.

1. **Sandi's Spent Amount**: Sandi initially had $600 and spent half of it at the farmer's market.
   \[
   \text{Sandi's spent amount} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
   \]

2. **Gillian's Spent Amount**: Gillian spent $150 more than three times what Sandi spent.
   \[
   \text{Gillian's spent amount} = 3 \times 300 + 150 = 900 + 150 = 1050
   \]

3. **Total Amount Spent by Gillian**: Gillian spent $1050 at the farmer's market.

Sandi spent half of her money at the farmer's market, which is $600 / 2 = $300. Gillian spent $150 more than three times what Sandi spent, so Gillian spent 3 * $300 + $150 = $900 + $150 = $1050. Therefore, the total amount Gillian spent is $1050.

1. Sandi initially had $600. She spent half of it at the farmer's market, which amounts to \(600 / 2 = 300\) dollars.
2. Gillian spent $150 more than three times the total amount Sandi spent at the farmer's market. That means Gillian spent \(3 \times 300 + 150 = 900 + 150 = 1050\) dollars.

1. Sandi had $600 and spent half of it at the farmer's market, so she spent $600 / 2 = $300 there.
2. Gillian spent $150 more than three times Sandi's total amount, which was $300. So Gillian spent $3 \times 300 + $150 = $900 + $150.
3. To find out the total that Gillian spent, we add her additional spending to Sandi's spending, which is $900 + $150 = $1050.

1. Sandi initially had $600.
   - She spent half of it at the farmer’s market, which means she spent \( \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) dollars at the market.

2. Gillian spent $150 more than three times Sandi's total.
   - Sandi's total is 300 dollars, so three times Sandi's total is \( 3 \times 300 = 900 \) dollars.
   - Gillian spent $150 more than this amount, which is \( 900 + 150 = 1050 \) dollars.

So, the total that Gillian spent at the farmer’s market is $1050.

First, we need to determine how much Sandi spent at the farmer's market. Sandi had $600 and she spent half of it, so Sandi spent $600 / 2 = $300 at the farmer's market.

Next, we need to calculate how much Gillian spent. Gillian spent $150 more than three times the amount Sandi spent. To find three times Sandi's total, we multiply her spending by 3: 
\[ 3 \times 300 = 900 \]

Then, we add $150 to this amount to find Gillian's total spending:
\[ 900 + 150 = 1050 \]

Therefore, Gillian spent a total of $1050 at the farmer’s market.

1. Sandi's initial amount is $600. She spent half of that at the farmer's market, which means she spent $600 / 2 = $300 at the market.

2. Gillian spent $150 more than three times Sandi's total. First, calculate three times Sandi's total: 3 * $300 = $900.

3. Now, add the $150 extra that Gillian spend: $900 + $150 = $1050.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sandi started with $600.
2. She spent half of it at the farmer's market, which means she spent:
   \[
   \frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ dollars}

3. Gillian spent $150 more than three times Sandi's total. First, let's calculate three times Sandi's total:
   \[
   3 \times 600 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Adding $150 to this amount provides Gillian's total expenditure:
   \[

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much Sandi spent at the farmer's market. Sandi originally had $600, and she spent half of it, which is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Amount Sandi spent} = \frac{1}{2} \times 600 = 300 \]

Next, we calculate Gillian's spending. Gillian spent $150 more than three times what Sandi spent. So, we first calculate three times what Sandi spent, and then add $150 to that amount to find Gillian's total spending:
\[ \text{Gillian's total spending} = (3 \times 300) + 150 = 900 + 150 = 1050 \]

To confirm, let's check Sandi's spending: Gillian spent more than three times what Sandi spent, which is $900 + $150 = $1050. Therefore, Gillian spent $1050 at the farmer's market.
