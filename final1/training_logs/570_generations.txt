###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Anthony and his friend Leonel read about the importance of keeping pets at home and decided to start adopting cats and dogs from the local rescue center. Anthony has 12 cats and dogs, 2/3 of which are cats. Leonel has half times as many cats as Anthony and seven more dogs than Anthony. How many animals in total do the two have?

system
To determine the total number of animals that Anthony and Leonel have, we need to calculate the number of cats and dogs each person has and then sum them up.

First, we know that Anthony has 12 cats and dogs, and 2/3 of them are cats. This means the remaining 1/3 are dogs. We calculate the number of dogs as follows:
\[
\text{Number of dogs} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]
So, Anthony has 4 dogs.

Next, we calculate the number of cats Anthony has. Since 2/3 of his total animals are cats, the number of cats is:
\[
\text{Number of cats} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8
\]
So, Anthony has 8 cats.

Since Leonel has half as many cats as Anthony, the number of cats Leonel has is:
\[
\text{Number of cats for Leonel} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4
\]
We also know that Leonel has seven more dogs than Anthony. Since Anthony has 4 dogs, Leonel has:
\[
\text{Number of dogs for Leonel} = 4 + 7 = 11
\]
So, Leonel has 11 dogs.

Now, we sum up all the animals that Anthony and Leonel have:
\[
\text{Total number of cats} = 8 + 4 = 12
\]
\[
\text{Total number of dogs} = 4 + 11 = 15
\]
\[
\text{Total number of animals} = 12 + 15 = 27
\]
So, the total number of animals that Anthony and Leonel have together is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]

Let's calculate the number of cats and dogs each person has:

Anthony has:
- Total animals: 12
- 2/3 are cats: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) cats
- The rest are dogs: 12 - 8 = 4 dogs

Leonel has:
- Anthony's number of cats: 2/3 of 12 = 8
- Seven more dogs than Anthony: 4 + 7 = 11 dogs

Total number of animals:
- Anthony: 8 cats + 4 dogs = 12 animals
- Leonel: 2/3 * 12 (cat calculation error, correct this) = 8 cats (from Anthony) + 11 dogs = 19 animals

Total animals for both Anthony and Leonel: 12 + 19 = 31 animals

However, the total calculated should be 12 (Anthony's total) plus 8 (correct calculation of Leonel's cats) plus 4 (Leonel's dogs) which equals 24. So, let's correct the calculation:

Anthony: 8 (cats) + 4 (dogs) = 12 animals
Leonel: 8 (cats) + (8 * (1 + 7/8)) (dogs), simplifying this part to 8 + (8 * 1) is correct as 8 + 8 = 16 dogs. 

Total: 12 (Anthony) + 16 (Leonel) = 28 animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals is 28.

To determine the total number of animals that Anthony and Leonel have, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many cats and dogs Anthony has:
- Anthony has a total of 12 cats and dogs.
- \( \frac{2}{3} \) of Anthony's total animals are cats. Therefore, the number of cats Anthony has is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ cats}
  \]
- The number of dogs Anthony has is the remaining part of his total, which is:
  \[
  12 - 8 = 4 \text{ dogs}
  \]

Next, we calculate the number of animals Leonel has:
- Leonel has half as many cats as Anthony. Thus, the number of cats Leonel has is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ cats}
  \]
- Leonel also has seven more dogs than Anthony. Therefore, the number of dogs Leonel has is:
  \[
  4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dogs}
  \]

Now, we sum up the total number of animals for both Anthony and Leonel:
- Anthony has a total of:
  \[
  8 \text{ cats} + 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ animals}
  \]
- Leonel has a total of:
  \[
  4 \text{ cats} + 11 \text{ dogs} = 15 \text{ animals}
  \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of animals:
\[
12 \text{ (Anthony)} + 15 \text{ (Leonel)} = 27 \text{ animals}
\]

Therefore, the total number of animals that Anthony and Leonel have is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Anthony has 12 animals in total, and 2/3 of them are cats. This means that:
   \[ \text{Number of cats Anthony has} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]
   So, Anthony has 8 cats and 12 - 8 = 4 dogs.

2. Leonel has half as many cats as Anthony, so:
   \[ \text{Number of cats Leonel has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \]
   And Leonel has 7 more dogs than Anthony, so:
   \[ \text{Number of dogs Leonel has} = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals they both have together:
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = \text{Number of cats Anthony has} + \text{Number of dogs Anthony has} + \text{Number of cats Leonel has} + \text{Number of dogs Leonel has} \]
\[ = 8 + 4 + 4 + 11 = 27 \]

So, the two of them have a total of 27 animals.

Anthony has 12 cats and dogs, with 2/3 of them being cats. That means he has \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) cats and \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) dogs. Thus, Anthony has 12-8=4 dogs.

Leonel has half as many cats as Anthony, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) cats, and seven more dogs than Anthony, which is \( 4 + 7 = 11 \) dogs.

So, Leonel has 4 cats and 11 dogs.

Adding up, Anthony has 8 + 4 = 12 cats and dogs, and Leonel has 4 + 11 = 15 cats and dogs.

In total, Anthony and Leonel have \( 12 + 15 = 27 \) animals.

To find out how many cats and dogs Anthony has, first calculate the number of cats:

(2/3 of 12 cats) = 8 cats

Anthony has 12 - 8 = 4 dogs.

Leonel has half times as many cats as Anthony:

(1/2 * 8 cats) = 4 cats.

Leonel has seven more dogs than Anthony:

(12 dogs + 7) = 19 dogs.

Anthony has 8 cats and 4 dogs, and Leonel has 4 cats and 19 dogs.

Adding them all together:

8 cats (Anthony) + 4 dogs (Anthony) + 4 cats (Leonel) + 19 dogs (Leonel) = 35 animals.

Let's first calculate the number of cats Anthony has. Anthony has 12 cats in total, and 2/3 of them are cats, which means he has:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ cats} \]

Since the total number of cats and dogs is 12, the number of dogs Anthony has is:

Leonel has half as many cats as Anthony, so:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ cats} \]

Leonel has seven more dogs than Anthony, so:

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals each person has:
- Anthony has 8 cats and 4 dogs, for a total of:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ animals} \]

- Leonel has 4 cats and 11 dogs, for a total of:

Let's break down the information given:

1. Anthony has a total of 12 cats and dogs.
2. 2/3 of Anthony's animals are cats, so the number of cats Anthony has is (2/3) * 12 = 8 cats.
3. Therefore, the number of dogs Anthony has is 12 - 8 = 4 dogs.

Leonel has half as many cats as Anthony, so Leonel has 8 / 2 = 4 cats.
Leonel has seven more dogs than Anthony, so Leonel has 4 + 7 = 11 dogs.

Now, to find the total number of animals they have, we add up the cats and dogs each has:
Anthony's total animals: 8 (cats) + 4 (dogs) = 12 animals.
Leonel's total animals: 4 (cats) + 11 (dogs) = 15 animals.

Adding both totals together, we get the combined total: 
12 (Anthony's animals) + 15 (Leonel's animals) = 27 animals.

Therefore, the two of them have a total of 27 animals.

1. **Anthony's Cats and Dogs:**
   - Anthony has a total of 12 animals.
   - \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his animals are cats, which means \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) cats.
   - Therefore, Anthony has \( 12 - 8 = 4 \) dogs.

2. **Leonel's Cats:**
   - Leonel has \( \frac{1}{2} \) times as many cats as Anthony. Since Anthony has 8 cats, Leonel has \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) cats.

3. **Leonel's Dogs:**
   - Leonel has seven more dogs than Anthony. Since Anthony has 4 dogs, Leonel has \( 4 + 7 = 11 \) dogs.

4. **Total Animals:**
   - Anthony has 8 cats + 4 dogs = 12 animals.

Anthony has 12 pets in total. Since 2/3 of them are cats, we can calculate the number of cats Anthony has by multiplying 12 by 2/3:

\[ \text{Number of cats Anthony has} = 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \]

This means Anthony has 8 cats and 4 dogs (since \(12 - 8 = 4\)).

Leonel has half as many cats as Anthony does. So, we calculate Leonel's cats as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cats Leonel has} = 8 \div 2 = 4 \]

Leonel also has seven more dogs than Anthony. Since Anthony has 4 dogs,Leonel will have:

\[ \text{Number of dogs Leonel has} = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Thus, Leonel has a total of:

\[ \text{Total number of pets Leonel has} = 4 \text{ (cats)} + 11 \text{ (dogs)} = 15 \]

To find the total number of animals they both have:

\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 8 \text{ (Anthony's cats)} + 4 \text{ (Anthony's dogs)} + 4 \text{ (Leonel's cats)} + 11 \text{ (Leonel's dogs)} = 27 \]
