First, determine the selling price of the 16-inch portrait, which is twice the price of 8-inch portrait: $5 * 2 = $10.

The profit for each day from selling 3 x 8 = 24 inches of 8-inch portraits, is 24 * $5 = $120 from the 8-inch portraits.
The profit for each day from selling 5 x 16 = 80 inches of 16-inch portraits, is 80 * $10 = $800 from the 16-inch portraits.

On average, she makes $120 + $800 = $920 per day.

Now, to find out how much she earns every 3 days, she multiplies this amount by 3, so: $3 * $920 = $2,760.

The 16-inch portrait sells for 5*2 = $10.
She earns 8*5=$40 from the 8-inch portrait per day.
She earns 16*10=$160 from the 16-inch portrait per day.
Hence, she earns a total of 40+160 = $200 per day.

Therefore, she earns 200*3=$600 every 3 days.

The 16-inch portrait is sold for $10 since it is twice the price of the 8-inch portrait, and it is sold 5 times more than the 8-inch portrait, which is 5 * 3 = 15. She earns $5 * 3 = $15 from selling the 8-inch portraits every day. Thus, she earns $10 + $15 = $25 each day. Therefore, she earns $25 * 3 = $75 every 3 days.

Sansa sells an 8-inch portrait for $5, and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait, so she sells the 16-inch portrait for $5 * 2 = $10.

She sells three 8-inch portraits per day, so she earns 3 * $5 = $15 from the 8-inch portraits every day.

She sells five 16-inch portraits per day, so she earns 5 * $10 = $50 from the 16-inch portraits every day.

Every day, she earns $15 + $50 = $65.

First, calculate the price of a 16-inch portrait: 
\[ \text{Price of a 16-inch portrait} = 2 \times \text{Price of an 8-inch portrait} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, calculate her daily earnings from selling three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits:
\[ \text{Daily earnings from 8-inch portraits} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \, \text{dollars} \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings from 16-inch portraits} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total daily earnings} = 15 + 50 = 65 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, calculate her earnings over three days:
\[ \text{Total earnings over 3 days} = 65 \times 3 = 195 \, \text{dollars} \]

Sansa sells an 8-inch portrait for $5 and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait, which is $10. 

Every day, she sells:
3 * $5 = $15 for an 8-inch portrait
5 * $10 = $50 for a 16-inch portrait

In 3 days, she will earn:
3 days * $15 one 8-inch portrait for $5 = $45
3 days * $50 one 16-inch portrait for $10 = $150

So, in total, she will earn:
$45 + $150 = $195

To calculate the daily earnings, we first need to find out the price of the 16-inch portrait, which is twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. The 8-inch portrait is priced at $5, so the 16-inch portrait is priced at $10. 

Now, she sells three 8-inch portraits per day, so her earnings from the 8-inch portraits are 3 * $5 = $15 per day. Similarly, she sells five 16-inch portraits per day, so her earnings from the 16-inch portraits are 5 * $10 = $50 per day.

So, her total earnings per day are $15 + $50 = $65. 

To find out her earnings in 3 days, we simply multiply her daily earnings by 3: $65 * 3 = $195.
