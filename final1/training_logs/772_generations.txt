To find out how many hours each person worked, we need to calculate:

1. Amber's hours: 12 hours
2. Armand's hours: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) hours
3. Ella's hours: \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) hours

Now, to find the total number of hours they worked together, we simply add these values:

Total hours = Amber's hours + Armand's hours + Ella's hours

Total hours = 12 + 4 + 24 = 40 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the three people is 40 hours.

First, we need to determine how many hours Armand worked. Since Armand worked one-third as long as Amber, and Amber worked for 12 hours, we calculate Armand's hours as follows:

\[ \text{Armand's hours} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Amber's hours} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Ella worked. Ella worked twice as long as Amber, so we calculate her hours as follows:

\[ \text{Ella's hours} = 2 \times \text{Amber's hours} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Now that we know how many hours each person worked, we can find the total hours worked by adding up their individual hours:

\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Amber's hours} + \text{Armand's hours} + \text{Ella's hours} = 12 + 4 + 24 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the three people is 40 hours.

To find the total number of hours worked by Amber, Armand, and Ella, we start by determining the hours worked by each individual.

1. Amber worked for 12 hours.
2. Armand worked one-third as long as Amber, so he worked:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. Ella worked twice as long as Amber, so she worked:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

Next, we sum the hours worked by all three individuals:
\[
12 + 4 + 24 = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours worked by Amber, Armand, and Ella is:

First, let's determine the number of hours each person worked:

- Amber worked for 12 hours.
- Armand worked one-third as long as Amber, which is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) hours.
- Ella worked twice as long as Amber, which is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) hours.

Next, we add up the hours worked by all three:
- Amber's hours: 12
- Armand's hours: 4
- Ella's hours: 24

Total hours worked by all three = 12 + 4 + 24 = 40 hours.

Let's denote the number of hours Amber worked as A, Armand's hours as Ar, and Ella's hours as Ella.

From the problem:
1. Amber worked for 12 hours, so \( A = 12 \).
2. Armand worked one-third as long as Amber, so \( Ar = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) hours.
3. Ella worked twice as long as Amber, so \( Ella = 2 \times 12 = 24 \) hours.

The total number of hours worked by all three people is the sum of the hours worked by each individual:
\[ \text{Total} = A + Ar + Ella = 12 + 4 + 24 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total hours worked by Amber, Armand, and Ella is 40 hours.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Amber worked for 12 hours.
2. Armand worked one-third as long as Amber, so Armand worked \(12 / 3 = 4\) hours.
3. Ella worked twice as long as Amber, so Ella worked \(2 \times 12 = 24\) hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours worked by all three people:
- Amber: 12 hours
- Armand: 4 hours
- Ella: 24 hours

Total hours worked = 12 + 4 + 24 = 40 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours worked by Amber, Armand, and Ella is 40 hours.

To find the total hours worked by Amber, Armand, and Ella, we will first calculate the hours worked by each person individually and then sum them up.

1. **Amber's hours**: Amber worked for 12 hours.
2. **Armand's hours**: Armand worked one-third as long as Amber, so Armand's hours are:
   \[
   \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Ella's hours**: Ella worked twice as long as Amber, so Ella's hours are:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum up the hours worked by all three people:
\[
12 \text{ (Amber)} + 4 \text{ (Armand)} + 24 \text{ (Ella)} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the three people is 40 hours.

Let's calculate the hours each person worked:

   \text{Armand's hours} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ hours}

3. Ella worked twice as long as Amber:
   \[
   \text{Ella's hours} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ hours}

Total hours worked by the three people is:
\[
\text{Total hours} = \text{Amber's hours} + \text{Armand's hours} + \text{Ella's hours}

\[
\text{Total hours} = 12 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}

First, let's calculate how long Armand worked. Since Armand worked one-third as long as Amber, we can find his working hours by dividing Amber's working hours by 3:

Armand's working hours = Amber's working hours / 3
Armand's working hours = 12 hours / 3
Armand's working hours = 4 hours

Next, let's determine how long Ella worked. Ella worked twice as long as Amber, so we multiply Amber's working hours by 2:

Ella's working hours = Amber's working hours * 2
Ella's working hours = 12 hours * 2
Ella's working hours = 24 hours

Now we can calculate the total hours worked by adding up the numbers:

Total hours worked by all three = Amber's working hours + Armand's working hours + Ella's working hours
Total hours worked by all three = 12 hours + 4 hours + 24 hours
Total hours worked by all three = 40 hours

So, the three people worked a total of 40 hours.
