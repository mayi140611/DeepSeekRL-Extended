Andy spent 1 + 2*2 = $5. Bob spent 3 + amount of the fruit drink.
As Andy and Bob spent the same, there is a $5 gap to cover, hence the fruit drink costs $5.

Let's calculate the total amount Andy spent:
- Andy bought a can of soda at $1.
- He bought two hamburgers at $2 each, so that's 2 * $2 = $4.
- Therefore, Andy spent $1 + $4 = $5 in total.

Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, Bob also spent $5 in total.

Bob ordered two sandwiches for $3, so the cost of the sandwich was $3 * 2 = $6.

To find the cost of Bob's fruit drink, we subtract the cost of the sandwiches from the total amount Bob spent:
$5 (total) - $6 (sandwiches) = -$1.

The negative value indicates that it seems Bob's fruit drink was actually bought by Andy and the negative balance is for Andy's extra spending on lunch. 

Therefore, Bob's fruit drink cost $0, as the total spent must cover both Andy's and Bob's expenditures.

Andy's purchases amount to 1 can of soda + 2 hamburgers, which equals $1 + 2 * $2 = $5.

Bob's purchases amount to 2 sandwiches and a can of fruit drink, which equals 2 * $3 = $6.

Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, and Andy spent $5, it means Bob also spent $5.

Bob's fruit drink cost $1 (2 sandwiches cost $3, leaving $1 for the fruit drink).

system
Andy spent $1 (soda) + $2 (first hamburger) + $2 (second hamburger) = $5.

Bob spent $3 (sandwiches) + cost of a fruit drink.

Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, we can set up the equation:

$5 = $3 (sandwiches) + cost of a fruit drink.

Now, let's solve for the cost of the fruit drink:

cost of a fruit drink = $5 - $3

Thus:

cost of a fruit drink = $2

Andy bought two hamburgers for $2 each, so he spent $4 on hamburgers.
He also bought a can of soda for $1.
So, Andy's total expenditure is $4 + $1 = $5.

Bob ordered two sandwiches for $3 and a can of fruit drink.
So, Bob's total expenditure is $3 + (cost of the fruit drink).

Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, we can set up the equation:
$3 + cost of the fruit drink = $5

Now, we solve for the cost of the fruit drink:
cost of the fruit drink = $5 - $3 = $2.
