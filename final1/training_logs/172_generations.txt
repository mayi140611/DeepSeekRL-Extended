#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####

system
Kyle initially bought 2 glass bottles that can hold 15 origami stars each, so for the 2 bottles, he needs \(2 \times 15 = 30\) origami stars. 

Then, he bought another 3 identical glass bottles, so for the additional 3 bottles, he also needs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) origami stars.

Therefore, Kyle needs to make \(30 + 45 = 75\) origami stars to fill all the glass bottles he bought.
