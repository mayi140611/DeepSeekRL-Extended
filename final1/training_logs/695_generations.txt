###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Marla is planning the lunch menu for an elementary school. There are 5 third grade classes with 30 students each, 4 fourth grade classes with 28 students each, and 4 fifth grade classes with 27 students each. Each student gets a hamburger, which costs $2.10, some carrots, which cost $0.50, and a cookie, which cost $0.20. How much does one lunch for all the students cost?

To determine the total cost of one lunch for all the students, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students in each grade.
2. Add these totals to get the overall number of students.
3. Determine the cost per lunch including all items (hamburger, carrots, and cookie).
4. Multiply the total number of students by the total cost per lunch.

Let's break it down:

- Third grade: 5 classes × 30 students/class = 150 students
- Fourth grade: 4 classes × 28 students/class = 112 students
- Fifth grade: 4 classes × 27 students/class = 108 students

Total number of students:
= 150 + 112 + 108 = 370 students

Now, we calculate the cost per lunch:
- Cost of a hamburger: $2.10
- Cost of carrots: $0.50
- Cost of a cookie: $0.20
- Total cost per lunch: $2.10 + $0.50 + $0.20 = $2.80

Finally, we calculate the total cost for all students:
= 370 students × $2.80 per lunch = $1036

Therefore, one lunch for all the students costs $1036.

To calculate the total cost of one lunch for all the students, we need to first determine the total number of students in each grade and then multiply that by the cost of one lunch (hamburger, carrots, and cookie).

1. **Third grade students:**
   - Number of classes: 5
   - Students per class: 30
   - Total students in third grade: \(5 \times 30 = 150\)

2. **Fourth grade students:**
   - Number of classes: 4
   - Students per class: 28
   - Total students in fourth grade: \(4 \times 28 = 112\)

3. **Fifth grade students:**
   - Number of classes: 4
   - Students per class: 27
   - Total students in fifth grade: \(4 \times 27 = 108\)

Now, we add up all the students:
- Total students = \(150 + 112 + 108 = 370\)

Each student gets one hamburger, carrots, and a cookie, so the cost of one lunch for one student is:
\[ \text{Cost per student} = \$2.10 + \$0.50 + \$0.20 = \$2.80 \]

Finally, to find the total cost for all students:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 370 \times \$2.80 = \$1036 \]

So, the total cost for one lunch for all the students is $\$1036$.

First, we need to calculate the total number of students in each grade:

- Third grade: 5 classes * 30 students/class = 150 students
- Fourth grade: 4 classes * 28 students/class = 112 students
- Fifth grade: 4 classes * 27 students/class = 108 students

Next, we'll sum the total number of students across all grades:

Total students = 150 + 112 + 108 = 370 students

Each student gets a hamburger, carrots, and a cookie. We first calculate the cost of each item:

- Cost of a hamburger = $2.10
- Cost of a carrot = $0.50
- Cost of a cookie = $0.20

The cost of one lunch for one student = Cost of hamburger + Cost of carrots + Cost of cookie = $2.10 + $0.50 + $0.20 = $2.80

Finally, we calculate the total cost for all students:

Total cost for all students = Total students * Cost of one lunch = 370 students * $2.80 = $1036

Therefore, the total cost of one lunch for all the students is $1036.

To calculate the total cost for Marla's lunch menu, we need to determine the total number of students and then calculate the cost based on the given prices for food items.

First, let's calculate the total number of students from each grade:

- Third grade: \( 5 \text{ classes} \times 30 \text{ students/class} = 150 \text{ students} \)
- Fourth grade: \( 4 \text{ classes} \times 28 \text{ students/class} = 112 \text{ students} \)
- Fifth grade: \( 4 \text{ classes} \times 27 \text{ students/class} = 108 \text{ students} \)

Now, we add up the total number of students:

\[ 150 + 112 + 108 = 370 \text{ students} \]

Each student gets a hamburger, carrots, and a cookie, and the cost for each item is given:

- Hamburger: $2.10
- Carrots: $0.50
- Cookie: $0.20

Each student requires:

\[ 2.10 + 0.50 + 0.20 = 2.80 \text{ (dollars)} \]

Thus, the total cost for one lunch for all students is:

\[ 370 \text{ students} \times 2.80 \text{ dollars/student} = 1036.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, one lunch for all the students costs $1036.00.

- Fifth grade: 4 classes * 27 students/class = 108 students

Now, let's add up all the students:

150 students (third grade) + 112 students (fourth grade) + 108 students (fifth grade) = 370 students in total.

Next, we calculate the cost for the hamburger:

- 1 hamburger costs $2.10
- 370 hamburgers * $2.10/hamburger = $787

Now, let's calculate the cost for the carrots:

- 1 carrot costs $0.50
- 370 carrots * $0.50/carrot = $185

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the cookies:

- 1 cookie costs $0.20
- 370 cookies * $0.20/cookie = $74

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:

Hamburgers: $787
Carrots: $185

The cost of the hamburgers is $2.10 each. So, for 370 students:

Finally, we add the cost of the carrots and the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2.10 + 0.50 + 0.20 = 2.80 \]

- Total number of fourth grade students: \( 4 \text{ classes} \times 28 \text{ students/class} = 112 \text{ students} \)
- Total number of fifth grade students: \( 4 \text{ classes} \times 27 \text{ students/class} = 108 \text{ students} \)

Now, let's find the total number of students across all grades:

\[ 150 \text{ (3rd grade)} + 112 \text{ (4th grade)} + 108 \text{ (5th grade)} = 370 \text{ students} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for each type of item:

- Cost of hamburger for one student: \( \$2.10 \)
- Cost of carrots for one student: \( \$0.50 \)
- Cost of a cookie for one student: \( \$0.20 \)

We then calculate the total cost for all students for each item:

- Total cost for one hamburger: \( 1 \times 2.10 = \$2.10 \)
- Total cost for carrots: \( 1 \times 0.50 = \$0.50 \)
- Total cost for a cookie: \( 1 \times 0.20 = \$0.20 \)

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for all students:

- Total cost for carrots: \( 370 \times 0.50 = \$185 \)
- Total cost for a cookie: \( 370 \times 0.20 = \$74 \)

Now, we sum up all these costs:

\[ \text{Total cost for hamburgers} + \text{Total cost for carrots} + \text{Total cost for cookies} = \$777 + \$185 + \$74 = \$1,036 \]

Therefore, the total cost for one lunch for all the students is \( \$1,036 \).

Total number of third grade students = 5 * 30 = 150
Total number of fourth grade students = 4 * 28 = 112
Total number of fifth grade students = 4 * 27 = 108

Each student gets a hamburger, carrots, and a cookie. The cost of these items per student can be calculated as follows:

Cost of hamburger per student = $2.10
Cost of carrots per student = $0.50
Cost of cookie per student = $0.20

Total cost per student = $2.10 + $0.50 + $0.20 = $2.80

For the third grade, there are 5 classes with 30 students each, for the fourth grade, there are 4 classes with 28 students each, and for the fifth grade, there are 4 classes with 27 students each. Once we have the total number of students, we can then calculate the total cost of lunch for all the students. The total cost will be the product of the number of students and the cost of lunch per student. Finally, we sum the total costs for each student group and the cookies and the cookies for the entire school.

Let's break this down step-by-step.

1. Number of third grade students: \( 5 \times 30 \)
2. Number of fourth grade students: \( 4 \times 28 \)
3. Number of fifth grade students: \( 4 \times 27 \)

Next, we calculate the cost for each student group:
- Cost per third grade student is \( \$2.10 \)
- Cost per fourth grade student is \( \$2.10 \)
- Cost per fifth grade student is \( \$2.10 \)

- Total cost for fourth grade students: \( 4 \times 28 \times 2.10 \)
- Total cost for fifth grade students: \( 4 \times 27 \times 2.10 \)

- Total cost for fourth grade students per lunch: \( 4 \times 28 \times 2.10 \)
- Total cost for fifth grade students per lunch: \( 4 \times 27 \times 2.10 \)

Finally, we add up the cost for all students and cookies for both sixth and seventh grades:
- Total cost for all students: \( (5 \times 30 \times 2.10 + 4 \times 28 \times 2.10 + 4 \times 27 \times 2.10) \)

\[ 5 \text{ classes} \times 30 \text{ students/class} = 150 \text{ students} \]

For the fourth grade:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 28 \text{ students/class} = 112 \text{ students} \]

- Each package of carrots: \(150 \text{ students} \times \$0.50 = \$75\)
- Each cookie: \(370 \text{ students} \times \$0.20 = \$74\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for one lunch for all the students:
