system
To calculate the total amount Daniela spends, we need to apply the discount to each item and then sum the discounted prices.

For the shoes:
- Original price per shoe = $50
- Discount on shoes = 40% off
- Discounted price per shoe = $50 - (40% of $50) = $50 - $20 = $30

Since she buys 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for shoes is:
- Total cost for shoes = 2 pairs Ã— $30 per pair = $60

For the dress:
- Original price of the dress = $100
- Discount on the dress = 20% off
- Discounted price of the dress = $100 - (20% of $100) = $100 - $20 = $80

Now, we add the total cost of the shoes and the dress:
- Total cost = Total cost for shoes + Cost of the dress = $60 + $80 = $140

Therefore, Daniela spends $140 in total.

To determine how much Daniela spends, we need to calculate the discounted prices for the shoes and the dress, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the shoes:
- The original price of one pair of shoes is $50.
- The discount on shoes is 40%, so the discount amount per pair is $50 * 0.40 = $20.
- The discounted price of one pair of shoes is $50 - $20 = $30.
- Since Daniela buys 2 pairs, the total cost for the shoes is 2 * $30 = $60.

Next, let's calculate the discounted price of the dress:
- The original price of the dress is $100.
- The discount on dresses is 20%, so the discount amount per dress is $100 * 0.20 = $20.
- The discounted price of the dress is $100 - $20 = $80.

Now, we add the total cost of the shoes and the dress to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost for shoes = $60
- Total cost for the dress = $80
- Total amount spent = $60 + $80 = $140.

Therefore, Daniela spends a total of $140.

To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the discount on each item and then subtract the discount from the original price.

For the shoes:
- Original price per pair = $50
- Discount on each pair = 40/100 * $50 = $20
- Discounted price per pair = $50 - $20 = $30
- Since Daniela buys 2 pairs, the total cost for shoes = 2 * $30 = $60

For the dress:
- Original price = $100
- Discount on the dress = 20/100 * $100 = $20
- Discounted price of the dress = $100 - $20 = $80

Total amount spent = Total cost of shoes + Total cost of the dress
Total amount spent = $60 + $80 = $140

To calculate the total amount Daniela spends, we first need to determine the original total cost of the items before the discount is applied.

The cost of one pair of shoes before the discount is $50. Therefore, for 2 pairs of shoes, the cost would be:
\[ 2 \times $50 = $100 \]

The dress costs $100, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ $100 \text{ (shoes)} + $100 \text{ (dress)} = $200 \]

Next, we apply the respective discounts to find out how much each item costs after the discount. For the shoes, the store offers a 40% discount, which means she pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost for the 2 pairs of shoes after the discount is:
\[ 2 \times $50 \times 60\% = 2 \times $50 \times 0.60 = $60 \]

For the dress, the store has a 20% discount, which means she pays 80% of the original price. So, the cost for the dress after the discount is:
\[ 1 \times $100 \times 80\% = 1 \times $100 \times 0.80 = $80 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount Daniela spends:
\[ $60 + $80 = $140 \]

To determine how much Daniela spends, we need to apply the discounts to the original prices of the shoes and the dress.

First, calculate the discount on the shoes:
- The original price of one pair of shoes is $50.
- The store has a 40 percent off on shoes, so the discount on one pair is \(50 \times 0.40 = 20\) dollars.
- Daniela buys 2 pairs of shoes, so the total discount on shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

Next, calculate the price of one pair of shoes after the discount:
- The price of one pair of shoes after the discount is \(50 - 20 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she buys 2 pairs, the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

Now, calculate the discount on the dress:
- The original price of the dress is $100.
- The store has a 20 percent off on dresses, so the discount on the dress is \(100 \times 0.20 = 20\) dollars.
- After the discount, the price of the dress is \(100 - 20 = 80\) dollars.

Finally, add the total cost of the shoes and the dress:
- The total cost Daniela spends is \(60 + 80 = 140\) dollars.

1. Calculate the discount on the shoes:
   - Each pair of shoes is $50.
   - The discount is 40%, so the discount amount per pair is \( 50 \times \frac{40}{100} = 50 \times 0.40 = 20 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price of one pair of shoes is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) dollars.
   - Daniela buys 2 pairs of shoes, so the total discount for the shoes is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discount on the dress:
   - The dress is originally priced at $100.
   - The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for the dress is \( 100 \times \frac{20}{100} = 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price of the dress is \( 100 - 20 = 80 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total amount spent:
   - The total amount spent on the shoes is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) dollars.
   - The total amount spent on the dress is \( 80 \) dollars.

To calculate the total amount Daniela spends, we need to determine the discount on the shoes and the dress and subtract it from their original prices.

First, let's calculate the discount on the 2 pairs of shoes:
\[
\text{Discount on shoes for each pair} = 40\% \times \text{Price per pair} = 0.40 \times \$50 = \$20
\]
Since Daniela buys 2 pairs of shoes, the total discount on the shoes is:
\[
2 \times \$20 = \$40
\]

Next, let's calculate the discount on the dress:
\[
\text{Discount on dress} = 20\% \times \text{Price of the dress} = 0.20 \times \$100 = \$20
\]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the shoes after applying the discount:
\[
\text{Total cost of shoes} = (2 \times \$50) - \$40 = \$100 - \$40 = \$60
\]

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Daniela spends on the dress:
\[
\text{Total cost of dress} = \$100 - \$20 = \$80
\]

Adding the cost of the shoes and the dress gives us the total amount Daniela spends:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \$60 + \$80 = \$140

To find out how much Daniela spends, we need to calculate the discount for each item and then subtract it from the original price.

For the shoes: 40% off means she pays 60% of the original price. 
2 pairs of shoes at $50 each: $50 x 2 = $100
60% of $100 = 0.60 x $100 = $60

For the dress: 20% off means she pays 80% of the original price.
1 dress at $100: $100
80% of $100 = 0.80 x $100 = $80

Now we add the discounted prices for the shoes and the dress to find the total cost.

Total cost = $60 (shoes) + $80 (dress) = $140

Therefore, Daniela spends $140 in total.

The cost of one pair of shoes is $50 x 0.40 = $20 less after the sale.
So, one pair of shoes costs $50 - $20 = $30.
The cost of two pairs of shoes is $30 x 2 = $60.

The cost of one dress is $100 x 0.20 = $20 less after the sale.
So, one dress costs $100 - $20 = $80.

The total cost for one dress is $80 + $20 = $100.

To determine how much Daniela spends, we need to calculate the discounted prices of the shoes and the dress, and then sum these amounts.

First, calculate the discount on the shoes:
- The original price per pair of shoes is $50.
- The discount on each pair of shoes is 40%, which we can calculate as follows: \(50 \times 0.40 = 20\).

Therefore, each pair of shoes is discounted by $20, so the sale price for each pair is:
\[50 - 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}\]

Since Daniela buys 2 pairs of shoes, the total price for the shoes is:
\[30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, calculate the price of the dress before and after the discount:
- The original price of the dress is $100.
- The discount on the dress is 20%, which we can calculate as follows: \(100 \times 0.20 = 20\).

Therefore, the dress is discounted by $20, so the sale price for the dress is:
\[100 - 20 = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

Now, add the total price of the shoes and the dress to find the total amount Daniela spends:
\[60 + 80 = 140 \text{ dollars}\]
