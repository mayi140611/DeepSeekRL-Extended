To find out how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to set the record, we can use the following reasoning:

1. The record is 54,000 jumps.
2. Mark jumps 3 times per second.
3. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 3600 seconds in an hour.

We can calculate the total number of jumps Mark needs to make in 1 hour:

\[ \text{Jumps per hour} = \text{Jumps per second} \times \text{Seconds per minute} \times \text{Minutes per hour} \]

\[ \text{Jumps per hour} = 3 \times 60 \times 60 \]

\[ \text{Jumps per hour} = 10,800 \]

Now we can calculate the time in hours Mark would need to make 54,000 jumps:

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{\text{Total jumps needed}}{\text{Jumps per hour}} \]

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{54,000}{10,800} \]

\[ \text{Time in hours} = 5 \]

So, Mark would need 5 hours to jump rope 54,000 times.

To find out how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to set the record, we first need to calculate the total number of jumps he needs to make. Since the record is 54,000 jumps and Mark can jump 3 times a second, we divide the total jumps by the rate of jumps per second:

\[ \text{Total time in seconds} = \frac{\text{Total jumps}}{\text{jumps per second}} = \frac{54,000}{3} \]

\[ \text{Total time in seconds} = 18,000 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we convert the time from seconds to hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{\text{Total time in seconds}}{\text{seconds per minute} \times \text{minutes per hour}} \]

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{18,000}{60 \times 60} \]

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{18,000}{3,600} \]

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Mark would need to jump rope for 5 hours to set the record.

To determine how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to set the record of 54,000 jumps, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of jumps per hour:**
   - Mark can jump 3 times per second.
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of jumps per hour is calculated as:
     \[
     3 \text{ jumps/second} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10,800 \text{ jumps/hour}
     \]

2. **Convert the required jumps to hours:**
   - The record is 54,000 jumps.
   - To find the number of hours needed, we divide the total jumps by the number of jumps per hour:
     \[
     \frac{54,000 \text{ jumps}}{10,800 \text{ jumps/hour}} = \frac{54}{10.8} \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, Mark would need to jump rope for 5 hours to set the record.

To find out how many hours Mark would need to jump rope, we first need to calculate how many seconds he needs to complete the record.

The record is 54,000 jumps, and he can jump 3 times a second. So, the total number of seconds required is:

54,000 jumps / 3 jumps/second = 18,000 seconds

Now, we need to convert the total seconds into hours. There are 3,600 seconds in an hour (since 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3,600 seconds/hour). So:

18,000 seconds / 3,600 seconds/hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Mark would need to jump rope for 5 hours to reach the record of 54,000 jumps.

Mark can jump 3 times per second. To find out how many seconds it would take him to jump 54,000 times, we divide 54,000 by 3. 
\[ \frac{54,000}{3} = 18,000 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total seconds into hours:
\[ \frac{18,000}{60 \times 60} = \frac{18,000}{3,600} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

To find the number of hours Mark would need to jump rope to break the record, we first need to determine how many seconds he would need to jump 54,000 times.

54,000 times divided by 3 times per second gives us:
54,000 / 3 = 18,000 seconds

Next, we convert the number of seconds into hours by dividing by the number of seconds per hour, which is 3600 (60 seconds per minute times 60 minutes per hour).

18,000 seconds / 3600 seconds per hour = 5 hours

So Mark would need to jump rope for 5 hours to break the record.

To find out how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to set the record, we first need to calculate the total number of jumps he can make.

Mark can jump 3 times a second, so in one hour (which has 60 seconds), he can do:

\[ 3 \text{ jumps/second} \times 60 \text{ seconds/hour} = 180 \text{ jumps/hour} \]

The record is 54,000 jumps, so we divide the total record jumps by the number of jumps Mark can do in one hour:

\[ 54,000 \text{ jumps} \div 180 \text{ jumps/hour} = 300 \text{ hours} \]

So, Mark would need to jump rope for 300 hours to set the record.

To find out how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to set the record, we first need to calculate the total number of seconds required to jump 54,000 times.

Mark jumps 3 times a second, so the total number of seconds required is:
\( \text{Total seconds} = \frac{\text{Total jumps}}{\text{Time per jump}} = \frac{54,000}{3} = 18,000 \text{ seconds} \)

Now, we need to convert the total number of seconds into hours. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) seconds in an hour.

So, the total time in hours is:
\( \text{Total hours} = \frac{\text{Total seconds}}{\text{Seconds per hour}} = \frac{18,000}{3600} = 5 \text{ hours} \)

Therefore, Mark would need to jump rope for 5 hours to set the record.

To determine how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to break the record, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time needed to jump 54,000 times:**
   - Mark can jump 3 times per second.
   - Therefore, the total number of seconds required to jump 54,000 times is:
     \[
     \text{Total seconds} = \frac{54,000 \text{ jumps}}{3 \text{ jumps/second}} = 18,000 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Convert the total time from seconds to hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.
   - First, convert seconds to minutes:
     \[
     \text{Total minutes} = \frac{18,000 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 300 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Then, convert minutes to hours:
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Let's break it down further to ensure accuracy:
     \[
     \text{Total seconds} = 54,000 \text{ jumps} \times 3 \text{ jumps/second} = 162,000 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total minutes} = \frac{162,000 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2,700 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = \frac{2,700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 45 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - This calculation shows that Mark would need at least 45 hours to jump 54,000 times at 3 jumps per second, but since the problem specifies "the record is 54,000," Mark would need to jump one more time to break the record. This means he would need slightly more than 45 hours. However, if we are asked for the time to break the record, we can say:

Therefore, Mark would need to jump rope \boxed{\text{45 hours}} to break the record.

To find out how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to set the record, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the total jumps into seconds**: Since the record is 54,000 jumps, and Mark can jump 3 times a second, we can calculate the total time in seconds by dividing the total number of jumps by the number of jumps per second.
   \[
   \text{Total time in seconds} = \frac{54,000 \text{ jumps}}{3 \text{ jumps/second}} = 18,000 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Convert the total time from seconds to hours**: There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we divide the total time in seconds by 3600 to convert it to hours.
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{18,000 \text{ seconds}}{3600 \text{ seconds/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Explanation**:
The reasoning is based on the conversion between units of time. First, we convert the number of jumps into seconds by dividing the jumps by the rate at which Mark can jump. Then, we convert the total time in seconds to hours by dividing by the number of seconds in an hour.

**Answer**:
Mark would need to jump rope for 5 hours to set the record.

To find out how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to reach the record of 54,000 jumps, we first need to calculate the total number of seconds he would need for 54,000 jumps.

Total seconds needed = Total jumps / Jumps per second

Substitute the values:

Total seconds needed = 54,000 / 3

Total seconds needed = 18,000

Now, we know there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. We now need to convert 18,000 seconds into hours.

First, convert seconds into minutes:

Total minutes needed = Total seconds needed / 60

Total minutes needed = 18,000 / 60

Total minutes needed = 300

Now, convert minutes into hours:

Total hours needed = Total minutes needed / 60

Total hours needed = 300 / 60

Total hours needed = 5

Therefore, Mark would need 5 hours to jump rope 54,000 times to reach the record.
