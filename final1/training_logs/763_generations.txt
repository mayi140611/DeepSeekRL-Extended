<reasoning>
First, let's calculate how many kids went tubing. A fourth of the kids went tubing, so we calculate:
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
$$
So, 10 kids went tubing. Next, we calculate how many of these tubers went rafting. Half of the tubers went rafting, so we calculate:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5
$$
So, 5 of the kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion.

First, we need to determine how many kids went tubing. A fourth of the kids went tubing, so \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) kids went tubing.

Next, half of the tubers went rafting, so \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) kids went both tubing and rafting. This is the number of kids who joined the rafting excursion and were also on the tubing excursion.

First, we determine how many kids went tubing. Since a fourth of the kids went tubing, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]
So, 10 kids went tubing.

Next, we know that half of the tubers went rafting. Therefore, the number of kids who went both tubing and rafting is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5
\]

So, the number of kids who joined the rafting excursion and also went tubing is 5.

We are told that there were 40 kids on Lake Pleasant and a fourth of them went tubing, which means \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) kids went tubing.

Out of the kids who went tubing, only half of them also went rafting, meaning \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) kids went both tubing and rafting.

Therefore, 5 kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####

<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of kids who went tubing.
2. Calculate the number of kids who went rafting, knowing that only half of the tubers went rafting.
3. Determine how many of the kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion.

Let's start with step 1:

A fourth of the kids went tubing. Since there were 40 kids on Lake Pleasant, the number of kids who went tubing is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Now, for step 2, we know that only half of the tubers went rafting. So, the number of kids who went rafting is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \]

Finally, for step 3, we need to find out how many of the kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion. Since we already know that 5 kids went rafting and 10 kids went tubing, and all the tubers went rafting, the number of kids who went both tubing and rafting is:
\[ 10 - (10 - 5) = 5 \]

So, 5 of the kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion.

   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 kids went tubing.

2. Next, we are told that only half of the tubers went rafting. Therefore, the number of tubers who went rafting is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5
   \]
   so, 5 kids went rafting after tubing.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find out how many kids went rafting and were also on the tubing excursion.

1. There were 40 kids on Lake Pleasant initially.
2. A fourth of the kids went tubing. This means \(40 / 4 = 10\) kids went tubing.
3. Only half of the tubers went rafting. So, the number of kids who went rafting is half of the tubers, which is \(10 / 2 = 5\) kids.

So, 5 of the kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion.

To solve this problem, we will calculate the number of kids who went tubing, the number of kids who went rafting, and the overlap between the two activities.

First, we find the number of kids who went tubing. Since a fourth of the kids went tubing, we calculate:
\[
\frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ kids}
\]

Next, we determine how many of these tubers went rafting. Since only half of the tubers went rafting, we calculate:
\[
\frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ kids}
\]

Therefore, the number of kids who joined both the tubing and rafting excursions is 5.
