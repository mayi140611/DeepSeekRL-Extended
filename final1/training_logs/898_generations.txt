<reasoning>
Troy had 300 straws in total, and he fed 3/5 of these to the adult pigs. So, the number of straws given to the adult pigs is 3/5 * 300 = 180 straws. The remaining straws, which are 300 - 180 = 120 straws, were given to the piglets.

There were 20 piglets, and the same number of straws were given to each piglet. So, the number of straws each piglet ate is 120 / 20 = 6 straws.

To find out how many straws each piglet ate, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Troy fed \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the straws to the adult pigs:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ straws}
   \]

2. Troy fed the remaining \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the straws to the piglets, because \( 1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5} \):
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 300 = 120 \text{ straws}
   \]

3. There are 20 piglets, and the total number of straws given to the piglets is 120:
   \[
   \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ straws per piglet}
   \]

So, each piglet ate 6 straws.

First, we need to find out how many straws Troy fed to the adult pigs. He fed \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the 300 straws to them:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ straws}
\]

Since the number of straws fed to the piglets is equal to the number fed to the adult pigs, they each received 180 straws. 

The total number of piglets is 20, so we need to find out how many straws each piglet ate. To do this, we divide the total number of straws the piglets received by the number of piglets:

\[
180 \text{ straws} \div 20 \text{ piglets} = 9 \text{ straws per piglet}
\]

Thus, each piglet ate 9 straws.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Troy initially has 300 straws.
2. He fed \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the straws to the adult pigs. So, the number of straws given to the adult pigs is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \) straws.
3. Let the number of straws given to each piglet be \( x \). Since there are 20 piglets and they each got \( x \) straws, the total number of straws given to the piglets is \( 20x \).
4. The total number of straws given to both the adult pigs and the piglets is the sum of the straws fed to the adult pigs and the piglets: \( 180 + 20x \).
5. Since all 300 straws were given out, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   180 + 20x = 300
   \]
6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   20x = 300 - 180
   \]
   \[
   20x = 120
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
   \]

So, each piglet ate 6 straws.

First, we need to determine how many straws Troy fed to the adult pigs. Since he fed \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the straws to the adult pigs, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ straws} \]

Next, let's find out how many straws Troy fed to the piglets. Since the number of straws fed to the piglets is equal to the number of straws fed to the adult pigs, this amounts to 180 straws.

There were 20 piglets, so each piglet would therefore eat:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ straws}}{20 \text{ piglets}} = 9 \text{ straws per piglet} \]

Now we'll go ahead and check if the number of straws used up matches the previous computations.

Let's go through the problem step by step to determine the number of straws each piglet ate.

1. Troy initially had 300 straws.
2. He fed 3/5 of the straws to the adult pigs. To find out how many straws this is:
   \[
   \text{Straws fed to adult pigs} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
   \]
3. The number of straws left to be fed to the piglets is:
   \[
   \text{Straws left} = 300 - 180 = 120
   \]
4. Since the straws given to the piglets were equal, each piglet received:
   \[
   \text{Straws per piglet} = \frac{120}{20} = 6
   \]

So each piglet ate 6 straws.

To determine how many straws each piglet ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of straws Troy fed to the adult pigs.
2. Determine the total number of straws fed to the piglets.
3. Divide the number of straws fed to the piglets by the number of piglets to find out how many straws each piglet ate.

Step 1: Calculate the number of straws Troy fed to the adult pigs.
Troy fed \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the 300 straws to the adult pigs.
Number of straws fed to the adult pigs = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \) straws.

Step 2: Determine the total number of straws fed to the piglets.
Since Troy fed an equal number of straws to the adult pigs and the piglets, and the adult pigs received 180 straws, the piglets also received 180 straws in total.

Step 3: Divide the number of straws fed to the piglets by the number of piglets.
The number of piglets is given as 20.
Number of straws each piglet ate = \( \frac{180}{20} = 9 \) straws.

So, each piglet ate 9 straws.

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ straws} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of straws fed to the piglets. Since each piglet received an equal number of straws, the total number of straws fed to the piglets is \( 20x \). 

Thus, the total number of straws given to both piglets and adult pigs is:
\[ 180 + 20x \]

This total number of straws is equal to the total number of straws Troy initially had, which is 300. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 180 + 20x = 300 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 20x = 300 - 180 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, each piglet ate 6 straws.
