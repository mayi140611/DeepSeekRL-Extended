###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

The student council sells scented erasers in the morning before school starts to help raise money for school dances. The local bookstore donated 48 boxes of erasers. There are 24 erasers in each box. If the student council sells the erasers for $0.75 each, how much money will they make?

system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of erasers and then determine the total money made from selling them.

1. Calculate the total number of erasers: Since there are 24 erasers in each box and 48 boxes donated, we multiply the number of erasers per box by the number of boxes:
   \[
   24 \text{ erasers/box} \times 48 \text{ boxes} = 1152 \text{ erasers}
   \]

2. Calculate the total money made from selling the erasers: Since each eraser is sold for $0.75, we multiply the total number of erasers by the price per eraser:
   \[
   1152 \text{ erasers} \times \$0.75/\text{eraser} = \$864
   \]

Now, let's write out the reasoning clearly:
1. We multiplied the number of erasers per box by the number of boxes to find the total number of erasers.
2. We multiplied the total number of erasers by the price per eraser to find the total money made.

To find out how much money the student council will make, we first need to calculate the total number of erasers. We know that there are 48 boxes of erasers, with each box containing 24 erasers. 

\[
\text{Total number of erasers} = 48 \times 24
\]

\[
1632 \text{ erasers}
\]

Since the student council sells each eraser for $0.75, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total number of erasers by the price per eraser.

\[
\text{Total money made} = 1632 \text{ erasers} \times 0.75 \text{ dollars/eraser}

First, we need to find out the total number of erasers donated. Since there are 48 boxes and each box contains 24 erasers, the total number of erasers is \(48 \times 24\). Let's calculate that first.

Then, we'll multiply the total number of erasers by the price per eraser to find out the total money made.

<reasoning>
Let's start with the calculation for the total number of erasers: \(48 \times 24 = 1152\). Next, we'll calculate the total money the student council will make by selling all the erasers at $0.75 each, which is \(1152 \times 0.75\).

First, we need to calculate the total number of erasers. Since there are 24 erasers in each box and 48 boxes were donated, the total number of erasers is:

\[ 48 \, \text{boxes} \times 24 \, \text{erasers/box} = 1152 \, \text{erasers} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money can be made by selling all the erasers at $0.75 each. Since each eraser sells for $0.75, the total amount of money made is:

\[ 1152 \, \text{erasers} \times 0.75 \, \text{dollars/eraser} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the student council will make $864.

To find out how much money the student council will make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of erasers.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the erasers.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of erasers.**

There are 48 boxes of erasers, and each box contains 24 erasers.

\[
\text{Total number of erasers} = 48 \text{ boxes} \times 24 \text{ erasers per box}
\]

\[
\text{Total number of erasers} = 48 \times 24 = 1152 \text{ erasers}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the erasers.**

Each eraser is sold for $0.75.

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 1152 \text{ erasers} \times \$0.75 \text{ per eraser}
\]

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 1152 \times 0.75 = 864 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Answer:**

The student council will make \(\boxed{864}\) dollars.
