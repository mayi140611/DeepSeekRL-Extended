###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

On Sunday Trey is going to do some chores at home. First, he wants to make a To Do list and count up how many things he has to do that day and how long it should take. He has several items under 'clean the house,' 'take a shower' and then 'make dinner.' In total there are 7 things to do to clean the house; 1 thing to do to take a shower; and 4 things to do to make dinner. If everything on Trey's list takes 10 minutes to do, how many hours total will it take to complete Trey's list?

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine the total number of tasks on Trey's list. This is the sum of the individual tasks: 7 (cleaning the house) + 1 (taking a shower) + 4 (making dinner) = 12 tasks.

Next, we need to calculate the total time it will take to complete all the tasks. Since each task takes 10 minutes, we multiply the total number of tasks by the time per task: 12 tasks * 10 minutes/task = 120 minutes.

Finally, to convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes): 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, completing Trey's list will take 2 hours in total.

First, we need to calculate the total number of tasks in Trey's list:

- Cleaning the house: 7 things
- Taking a shower: 1 thing
- Making dinner: 4 things

Adding these together gives the total number of tasks:

\[ 7 + 1 + 4 = 12 \text{ tasks} \]

Each task takes 10 minutes to complete. So, the total time in minutes for all tasks is:

\[ 12 \text{ tasks} \times 10 \text{ minutes/task} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

We need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to complete Trey's list.

Trey has 7 tasks for cleaning the house, 1 task for taking a shower, and 4 tasks for making dinner. The total number of tasks is 7 + 1 + 4 = 12 tasks.

If each task takes 10 minutes, then the total time in minutes is 12 tasks * 10 minutes/task = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour = 60 minutes. So, 120 minutes รท 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take to complete Trey's list is 2 hours.

To determine the total time it will take to complete Trey's chores, we first need to calculate the total number of tasks and then multiply that by the time it takes to complete each task.

First, we add up the number of tasks in each category:
- Cleaning the house: 7 tasks
- Taking a shower: 1 task
- Making dinner: 4 tasks

Total number of tasks is \( 7 + 1 + 4 = 12 \).

Each task takes 10 minutes to complete, so for 12 tasks, the total time in minutes is \( 12 \times 10 = 120 \) minutes.

To convert this total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Trey 2 hours to complete his list of tasks.

First, we need to calculate the total number of items on Trey's list. There are 7 things to clean the house, 1 thing to take a shower, and 4 things to make dinner. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 7 \text{ (house)} + 1 \text{ (shower)} + 4 \text{ (dinner)} = 12 \text{ items} \]

Each item on Trey's list takes 10 minutes to do. Therefore, to find the total time required, we multiply the number of items by the time it takes to do each item:

\[ 12 \text{ items} \times 10 \text{ minutes/item} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Trey a total of 2 hours to complete his list.

3. Make dinner: 4 things

Adding these together, we get a total of:
\[ 7 + 1 + 4 = 12 \text{ things to do} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time required for all these tasks. Given that each task takes 10 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ tasks} \times 10 \text{ minutes/task} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour:

Therefore, it will take Trey a total of 2 hours to complete his list.

Trey has 7 tasks to clean the house, each taking 10 minutes, so it will take him \(7 \times 10 = 70\) minutes for this task.
He has 1 task to take a shower, which also takes 10 minutes.
He has 4 tasks to make dinner, each taking 10 minutes, so it will take him \(4 \times 10 = 40\) minutes for this task.

In total, it will take him \(70 + 10 + 40 = 120\) minutes to complete the entire list.

Trey has four main tasks: 7 items to clean the house, 1 item to take a shower, and 4 items to make dinner. Each task is estimated to take 10 minutes to complete.

First, let's calculate the total number of tasks:
\[ 7 \text{ (clean the house)} + 1 \text{ (take a shower)} + 4 \text{ (make dinner)} = 12 \text{ tasks} \]

Next, since each task is estimated to take 10 minutes, we multiply the total number of tasks by the time per task:
\[ 12 \text{ tasks} \times 10 \text{ minutes per task} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

To determine the total time it will take Trey to complete his list, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sum the number of tasks for each category on the To Do list.
2. Multiply the total number of tasks by the time it takes to complete each task.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Let's break it down:

- There are 7 things to do to clean the house.
- There is 1 thing to do to take a shower.
- There are 4 things to do to make dinner.

The total number of items on the list is:
\[ 7 \text{ (clean the house)} + 1 \text{ (take a shower)} + 4 \text{ (make dinner)} = 12 \text{ items} \]

Since each item takes 10 minutes to complete, the total time in minutes is:
\[ 12 \text{ items} \times 10 \text{ minutes/item} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
