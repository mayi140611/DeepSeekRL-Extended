system
Let's denote the number of meals Angela delivers as \( m \) and the number of packages as \( p \).

According to the problem:
\[ m + p = 27 \]

We also know that:
\[ p = 8m \] (Angela delivers 8 times as many packages as meals)

Now we substitute \( p \) in the first equation with \( 8m \):

\[ m + 8m = 27 \]
\[ 9m = 27 \]

To find \( m \), we divide both sides by 9:
\[ m = 27 / 9 \]
\[ m = 3 \]

So, Angela delivers 3 meals.

Let's denote the number of meals Angela needs to deliver as \( M \). According to the problem, the number of packages she needs to deliver is 8 times the number of meals, which we can denote as \( 8M \).

The total number of meals and packages is given as 27. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[ M + 8M = 27 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 9M = 27 \]

To find \( M \), we divide both sides of the equation by 9:

\[ M = \frac{27}{9} = 3 \]

So Angela delivers 3 meals.

system
Let's say the number of meals Angela delivers is \( m \) and the number of packages she delivers is \( p \). According to the information provided, we know that:

1. She needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals. So, \( p = 8m \).
2. The total number of meals and packages she needs to deliver is 27. So, \( m + p = 27 \).

Now, substituting the value of \( p \) in the second equation with \( 8m \) from the first equation, we get:

\( m + 8m = 27 \)

Combining like terms, we have:

\( 9m = 27 \)

Divide both sides by 9 to find \( m \):

\( \frac{9m}{9} = \frac{27}{9} \)

\( m = 3 \)

So, Angela delivers 3 meals.

system
Let's denote the number of packages Angela needs to deliver as \( P \) and the number of meals as \( M \). According to the problem, Angela needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals, which can be written as:
\[ P = 8M \]

Additionally, the total number of meals and packages she needs to deliver is 27. This can be written as:
\[ M + P = 27 \]

We already know from the first equation that \( P = 8M \). We can substitute \( 8M \) for \( P \) in the second equation:
\[ M + 8M = 27 \]
\[ 9M = 27 \]

Now, solve for \( M \):
\[ M = \frac{27}{9} \]
\[ M = 3 \]

So, Angela delivers 3 meals.

Let's denote the number of meals Angela delivers as M and the number of packages as P.

According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Angela needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals, so P = 8M.
2. The total number of meals and packages combined is 27, so M + P = 27.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second:

M + 8M = 27

This simplifies to:

9M = 27

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

M = 3

Therefore, Angela delivers 3 meals.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####

system
Let \( M \) represent the number of meals and \( P \) represent the number of packages. According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of meals and packages combined is 27.
2. The number of packages is 8 times the number of meals.

We can express these pieces of information with the following equations:
\[ M + P = 27 \]
\[ P = 8M \]

We can substitute the expression for \( P \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ M + 8M = 27 \]
\[ 9M = 27 \]

Next, we solve for \( M \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 9:
\[ M = \frac{27}{9} \]
\[ M = 3 \]

So, Angela delivers \(\boxed{3}\) meals.
