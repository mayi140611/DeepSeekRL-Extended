Angie bought 3 lbs. of coffee. Each lb. of coffee will brew about 40 cups of coffee. Angie drinks 3 cups of coffee every day.

To find out how many days the coffee will last, we need to divide the total amount of coffee by the amount of coffee Angie drinks per day.

\( \text{Number of days the coffee will last} = \frac{\text{Total amount of coffee}}{\text{Coffee Angie drinks per day}} \)

\( \text{Number of days the coffee will last} = \frac{3 \text{ lbs}}{3 \text{ cups/day}} \)

\( \text{Number of days the coffee will last} = 1 \text{ day} \)

1 lb of coffee will brew about 40 cups of coffee, so 3 lbs of coffee will brew about 3 * 40 = 120 cups of coffee.
Angie drinks 3 cups of coffee every day, so the coffee will last her 120 / 3 = 40 days.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####

system
To find out how many days the coffee will last, we first need to determine the total number of cups of coffee that can be brewed from 3 lbs. of coffee.

Each lb. of coffee produces 40 cups of coffee. So, for 3 lbs. of coffee, there will be:

\(3 \text{ lbs} \times 40 \text{ cups/lb} = 120 \text{ cups of coffee}\).

Now, if Angie drinks 3 cups of coffee every day, we can find out how many days the coffee will last by dividing the total number of cups by the amount she drinks per day:

\(120 \text{ cups} \div 3 \text{ cups/day} = 40 \text{ days}\).

First, we need to determine the total amount of coffee Angie has. Since each pound of coffee brews 40 cups and she bought 3 lbs, we calculate the total cups of coffee:

\[ 3 \text{ lbs} \times 40 \text{ cups/lb} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days the coffee will last if Angie drinks 3 cups every day. We do this by dividing the total number of cups by the number of cups she drinks per day:

\[ 120 \text{ cups} \div 3 \text{ cups/day} = 40 \text{ days} \]
