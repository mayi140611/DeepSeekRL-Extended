#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
First, let's find out how many kilograms of grapes Boris uses in a year before the increase. 

90 kilograms/6 months * 2 = 30 kilograms/month

Now, the store wants to increase production by 20%. To calculate the new amount needed per month, we multiply the current monthly usage by 1+20%.

30 kilograms/month * 1.20 = 36 kilograms/month

Finally, we need to calculate the annual usage by multiplying the monthly usage by 12.

36 kilograms/month * 12 months = 432 kilograms/year

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####

system
To find out how many grapes Borris liquor store needs in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent, we first need to calculate the current amount of grapes used every 6 months and then find out how much additional grapes will be needed after the increase. Then we'll multiply that by 2 to get the annual amount.

1 kg of grapes is used every 6 months, so 90 kg of grapes will be used every 6 months.
After increasing production by 20%, the store will use 90 kg + (90 kg * 20/100) = 90 kg + 18 kg = 108 kg of grapes every 6 months.

Now, we'll multiply the amount of grapes used every 6 months by 2 to get the annual amount:
108 kg * 2 = 216 kg

So, Borris liquor store needs 216 kilograms of grapes in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent.

To find out how many kilograms of grapes Boris needs in a year after increasing his production by 20%, we first need to calculate the current annual production:

90 kg/6 months * 2 = 30 kg/year

Now let's calculate the increased production:

30 kg/year * 1.20 = 36 kg/year

So Borris will need 36 kilograms of grapes in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent.

Currently, Borris uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months, which means he uses 90/2 = 45 kilograms of grapes in a month. If he increases his production by 20%, he will need 45 + (45*0.2) = 54 kilograms of grapes in a month. Therefore, in a year, he will need 54 * 12 = 648 kilograms of grapes.

Current use of grapes every 6 months = 90 kg
Increase the production by 20% = 90 kg * 20/100 = 18 kg
The additional grapes = 18 kg
Total grapes needed = 90 kg + 18 kg = 108 kg
There are 12 months in a year, so the total grapes needed in a year = 108 kg * 12 = 1296 kg

Borris currently uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months, which is 180 kilograms in a year.

To increase his production by twenty percent, we calculate 20% of 180 kilograms:
\( 180 \times 0.20 = 36 \) kilograms

Adding the increase to his current usage:
\( 180 + 36 = 216 \) kilograms of grapes in a year after increasing his production.

Currently, Brorâ€™s grape consumption is 90 kg for 6 months. In a year, he would consume 90*2=180 kg of grapes.
He is considering a 20% increase, which is 180*20/100=36 kg.
This means he would need 180+36=216 kg of grapes a year after his anticipated production increase.

The store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months, so in a year it uses 90 kilograms x 2 = 180 kilograms.
To increase his production by twenty percent, he needs 180 kilograms x 0.20 = 36 kilograms of grapes.
Therefore, he needs 180 kilograms + 36 kilograms = 216 kilograms of grapes in a year after increasing his production.

To determine how many kilograms of grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the current annual production.
2. Determine the increase in production by twenty percent.
3. Calculate the new annual production.

Step 1: Calculate the current annual production.
Borris uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. Since there are 2 periods of 6 months in a year, the annual production is:
\[ 90 \text{ kg} \times 2 = 180 \text{ kg} \]

Step 2: Determine the increase in production by twenty percent.
To find the increase, we calculate 20% of the current annual production:
\[ 180 \text{ kg} \times 0.20 = 36 \text{ kg} \]

Step 3: Calculate the new annual production.
To find the new annual production after increasing by twenty percent, we add the increase to the original annual production:
\[ 180 \text{ kg} + 36 \text{ kg} = 216 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the amount of grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent is \(\boxed{216}\) kilograms.

#### GENERATION 15 RESPONSE ####

system
First, let's calculate the total amount of grapes Borris uses in a year before the production increase:

Borris uses 90 kg of grapes every 6 months. To find the amount used in a year, we multiply by 2:
\[ 90 \text{ kg} \times 2 = 180 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we calculate the production increase by twenty percent. To find the increase in kg, we multiply the current amount by the percentage increase:
\[ 180 \text{ kg} \times 0.2 = 36 \text{ kg} \]

Then, we add this increase to the original amount to find the new annual production:
\[ 180 \text{ kg} + 36 \text{ kg} = 216 \text{ kg} \]

So, Borris needs 216 kilograms of grapes in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent.
