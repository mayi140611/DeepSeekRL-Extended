system
To calculate the total earnings, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of periods the teacher works in a month:
   5 periods/day * 24 days/month = 120 periods/month

2. Calculate the monthly earnings:
   120 periods/month * $5/period = $600/month

3. Calculate the total earnings over 6 months:
   $600/month * 6 months = $3600

So, the teacher has earned a total of $3600 in 6 months.

To calculate the total earnings, we first find out how many periods the teacher teaches in a month. The teacher teaches 5 periods a day and works 24 days a month, so:

\[ \text{Periods per month} = 5 \times 24 = 120 \]

The teacher is paid $5 per period, so:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \]

The teacher has been working for 6 months, so:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 600 \times 6 = 3600 \]

Therefore, the teacher has earned a total of $3600.

system
First, we need to determine the teacher's daily earnings. The teacher works 5 periods a day and is paid $5 per period, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 5 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ dollars/period} = 25 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate the teacher's monthly earnings. The teacher works 24 days a month, so his monthly earnings are:
\[ 25 \text{ dollars/day} \times 24 \text{ days/month} = 600 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we calculate the teacher's earnings over 6 months:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 3600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount earned by the teacher in 6 months is:
\[ \boxed{3600} \]

To calculate the total earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of periods taught in a month.
2. Multiply the monthly period count by the number of months he has worked.
3. Multiply the total number of periods by the hourly rate to get the total earnings.

Let's break this down:

1. The teacher teaches 5 periods a day for 24 days a month.
   - Monthly periods = 5 periods/day * 24 days/month = 120 periods/month

2. Now multiply the monthly periods by the number of months he has been working:
   - Total periods = 120 periods/month * 6 months = 720 periods

3. Finally, multiply the total number of periods by the hourly rate ($5/period):
   - Total earnings = 720 periods * $5/period = $3600

So, the teacher has earned a total of $3600.

To calculate the total earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of periods the teacher works in a day.
2. Determine the number of periods the teacher works in a month.
3. Determine the number of periods the teacher has worked in 6 months.
4. Calculate the total earnings for all periods worked in 6 months.

Given:
- Teacher teaches 5 periods a day.
- Teacher works 24 days a month.
- Teacher is paid $5 per period.

Let's calculate:

1. Number of periods per day: 5
2. Number of periods per month = 5 periods/day * 24 days/month = 120 periods/month
3. Number of periods worked in 6 months = 120 periods/month * 6 months = 720 periods

Total earnings = Number of periods worked * Pay per period = 720 periods * $5/period = $3600

To find out how much the teacher has earned in total, we need to calculate his daily earnings, then multiply that by the number of days he has been working. 

1. The teacher teaches 5 periods a day, so his daily earnings are \(5 \text{ periods} \times \$5/\text{period} = \$25/\text{day}\).
2. Since he has been working for 6 months, we need to calculate the total number of days he has been working. Assuming a month has 30 days, he has worked \(6 \times 30 = 180\) days.
3. His total earnings for 6 months are \(180 \text{ days} \times \$25/\text{day} = \$4500\).

To calculate the total earnings, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the number of periods the teacher works in one day. This is given by 5 periods.
2. Next, multiply the number of periods per day by the number of days he works in a month to find out how many periods he works in one month: 5 periods/day * 24 days/month = 120 periods/month.
3. Now, calculate the teacher's monthly earnings by multiplying the number of periods he works in a month by the pay per period: 120 periods/month * $5/period = $600/month.
4. Finally, to find the total earnings over 6 months, multiply the monthly earnings by the number of months: $600/month * 6 months = $3600.

So, the teacher has earned a total of $3600 in 6 months.

To calculate the total earnings, we start by determining the number of periods the teacher works in a day, in a month, and in total over the six months.

1. Number of periods per day: 5
2. Number of working days per month: 24
3. Earnings per period: $5

First, let's calculate the periods worked in one month:
\[ \text{Periods per month} = \text{Periods per day} \times \text{Working days per month} \]
\[ \text{Periods per month} = 5 \times 24 = 120 \]

Now, calculate the total earnings for one month:
\[ \text{Earnings per month} = \text{Periods per month} \times \text{Earnings per period} \]
\[ \text{Earnings per month} = 120 \times 5 = 600 \]

Next, calculate the total earnings for the six months:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings per month} \times \text{Number of months} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 600 \times 6 = 3600 \]

So, the teacher has earned a total of $3600 in 6 months.

To calculate the total earnings, we'll first find out the daily earnings and then multiply that by the number of days worked and the number of months.

Daily earnings = Payment per period * Number of periods per day
Daily earnings = $5 * 5
Daily earnings = $25

Number of days worked per month = 24
Number of months worked = 6
Total days worked = 24 * 6 = 144 days

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Total days worked
Total earnings = $25 * 144
Total earnings = $3600
