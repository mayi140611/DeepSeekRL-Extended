#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To calculate the amount Dorothy needs to pay in taxes, we can multiply her annual income by the tax rate/percentage:

\[ 60000 \times 0.18 = 10800 \]

So, Dorothy needs to pay $10800 in taxes.

To find out how much money she will have left after paying the taxes, we subtract the tax amount from her annual income:

\[ 60000 - 10800 = 49200 \]

Therefore, after paying her taxes, Dorothy will have $49200 left.

To find out how much money Dorothy will have left after paying taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of taxes she has to pay.
2. Subtract the taxes from her annual earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of taxes.
Taxes = 18% of $60,000

Money left = $60,000 - $10,800
Money left = $49,200

Therefore, Dorothy will have $49,200 left after she pays the taxes.

To find out how much money Dorothy will have left after paying taxes, we need to calculate 18% of her yearly income and then subtract that amount from her total income.

18% of $60,000 can be calculated as:

\( \text{Income after taxes} = \text{Total income} - (\text{Total income} \times \text{Tax rate}) \)

\( \text{Income after taxes} = \$60,000 - (\$60,000 \times 0.18) \)

\( \text{Income after taxes} = \$60,000 - \$10,800 \)

\( \text{Income after taxes} = \$49,200 \)

So, after paying the taxes, Dorothy will have $49,200 left.

To find out how much money Dorothy will have left after paying taxes, we first need to calculate 18% of her annual income of $60,000.

Now we subtract the taxes from Dorothy's annual income to find out how much money she will have left after paying taxes.

\[ \text{Money left} = \text{Annual income} - \text{Taxes} \]

\[ \text{Money left} = 60,000 - 10,800 \]

To calculate the amount of money Dorothy will have left after paying taxes, we first need to determine the amount of taxes she needs to pay.

1. Dorothy's annual salary from work is $60,000.
2. She needs to pay 18% of this amount in taxes.

So, the amount of taxes she needs to pay is:
\[ \text{Taxes Payable} = \text{Annual Salary} \times \text{Tax Rate} \]
\[ \text{Taxes Payable} = 60000 \times 0.18 \]
\[ \text{Taxes Payable} = 10800 \]

Now, we subtract the amount of taxes from her annual salary to find out how much money she will have left:
\[ \text{Money Left} = \text{Annual Salary} - \text{Taxes Payable} \]
\[ \text{Money Left} = 60000 - 10800 \]
\[ \text{Money Left} = 49200 \]

So, Dorothy will have $49,200 left after she pays the taxes.
