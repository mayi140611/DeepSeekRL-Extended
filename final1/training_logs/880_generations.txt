<reasoning>
To determine the number of vampires after two nights, we start with the initial number of vampires, which is 2, and then we account for the nightly increase.

1. After the first night:
- Each of the 2 vampires turns 5 more people into vampires.
- So, 2 vampires each turn into 5 more vampires.
- Total new vampires: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
- Total vampires after the first night: \(2 + 10 = 12\).

2. After the second night:
- Each of the 12 vampires turns 5 more people into vampires.
- Total new vampires: \(12 \times 5 = 60\).
- Total vampires after the second night: \(12 + 60 = 72\).

So, after two nights, there are 72 vampires in Willowton.

Initially, there are 2 vampires in the village.

Each night, each vampire turns 5 more people into vampires. So on the first night:
- Each of the 2 vampires turns 5 people into vampires, resulting in \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) new vampires.

By the end of the first night, there are \( 2 + 10 = 12 \) vampires (the original 2 vampires plus the 10 new ones).

On the second night:
- Each of the 12 vampires from the first night turns 5 more people, resulting in \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \) new vampires.

By the end of the second night, there are \( 12 + 60 = 72 \) vampires (the original 12 plus the 60 new ones).

Initially, there are 2 vampires in Willowton. Every night, each vampire turns 5 more people into vampires. So, each night the amount of new vampires is doubled as more people are turned to vampires.

- After the first night:
  - Initial vampires: 2
  - New vampires turned: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
  - Total vampires: \( 2 + 10 = 12 \)

- After the second night:
  - Initial vampires: 12
  - New vampires turned: \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \)
  - Total vampires: \( 12 + 60 = 72 \)

So, there are 72 vampires after two nights.

After the first night, 2 vampires turn 5 people each into vampires, resulting in a total of \(2 \times 5 = 10\) new vampires. So there are now \(2 + 10 = 12\) vampires in the village. After the second night, another 12 people are turned into vampires (since each of the 12 new vampires turns 5 people, \(12 \times 5 = 60\)), so the total number of vampires becomes \(12 + 60 = 72\). 

However, we must consider that during the second night, one of the original vampires also turns themselves into a vampire. So the total number of vampires becomes \(72 - 1 + 1 = 72\). 

Thus, after two nights, there are 72 vampires in the village.

But, since the problem specifies that the village has 300 people, we need to find out how many of these 300 people are vampires after two nights. The calculation above seems to exceed the total population after two nights. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

If each vampire turns 5 people into vampires, then after each night, the vampire population triples in terms of the number of vampires (since each new vampire turns 5 people into vampires, increasing the total vampire population by a factor of \(5+1=6\) per generation).

Starting with 2 vampires, after the first night, there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) vampires. After the second night, the number of vampires triples again, so there are \(12 \times 6 = 72\) vampires. 

But, this still doesn't account for the total population. Since the total population is 300 and only 2 people can be vampires (if we assume vampires are the only inhabitants), we can simplify the problem.

Initially, 2 people are vampires. After the first night, 12 new vampires are born, but all are 300 people with the village still having 2 vampires. So the first night makes the total vampire population 14 and the total population 302, which is unfeasible.

After two nights, if assuming the simplest scenario with vampire breeding, the second night should also start with 12 new vampires but these should be 300 people (since each turns 5 into 6 vampires).

So, initially 2 people are vampires. After the first night, 2 vampires each turn 5 people into vampires, resulting in 12 new vampires, making total (2+12=14) vampires and 302 people. 

But the total village population shouldn't exceed 300:

So, vampires from the second night would be 12 people who turn 6 and become vampires, and 3 people from original population turn into 4 vampires. That brings up a total of 10 vampires.

So, the two nights can be:

Night 1: 2 vampires, 14 total vampires, 302 people
Night 2: 12 vampires, 8 more turn due to population being 302 but only 300 people exist, so no more vampires are added naturally, only those from the village population turn, leading to fewer vampires.

Therefore, after two nights, the total number of vampires is:

2 initial vampires + 12 new vampires (from the village population) = 14 vampires in total population.

However, this exceeds the village population, and the assumption of 2 vampires has to be adjusted.

Night 1: 2 vampires + 12 new vampires = 14 vampires total
Night 2:

Initially, there are 2 vampires in the village. Each night, each vampire turns 5 more people into vampires. 

- After the first night: 
  - The 2 original vampires each turn 5 people into vampires, so 2 vampires x 5 people/vampire = 10 new vampires are created.
  - Total vampires after the first night = 2 original vampires + 10 new vampires = 12 vampires.

- After the second night: 
  - Each of the 12 vampires from the first night turns 5 more people into vampires.
  - Total new vampires created in the second night = 12 vampires x 5 people/vampire = 60 new vampires.
  - Total vampires after the second night = 12 original vampires + 60 new vampires = 72 vampires.

Therefore, there are 72 vampires after two nights.

Initially, there are 2 vampires in Willowton. Every night, each vampire turns 5 more people into vampires.

- After the first night:
  - Each vampire turns 5 people into vampires.
  - Therefore, 5 new vampires are created.

- After the second night:
  - Each of the originally 2 vampires turned 5 people into vampires during the first night.
  - So, 10 newly turned people (5 from each of the 2 original vampires) become vampires.
  
  - Additionally, those 10 new vampires each turn 5 more people into vampires.
  - Therefore, 10 * 5 = 50 new vampires are created this second night.

- Summing these up:
  - Total from the original 2 vampires: 10 (initially) + 50 (second night) = 60 new vampires.
  
  - Total vampires after two nights: 2 (original) + 60 (new) = 62 vampires.

So, there are 62 vampires after two nights.

Each night, 5 new vampires are created from the 5 vampires in the village plus the 300 people, resulting in 305 new vampires being added to the village. This means the total number of vampires increases by 305 every night. After two nights, the total number of vampires will be 2 times 305, since the number of vampires increases by the same amount each night.

To determine the number of vampires after two nights, we need to calculate the effect of each vampire turning 5 people into vampires.

1. On the first night, each of the 2 vampires turns 5 people into vampires:
   - Number of new vampires created = 2 vampires * 5 people/vampire = 10 vampires

2. On the second night, each of these 10 new vampires turns 5 more people into vampires:
   - Number of new vampires created = 10 vampires * 5 people/vampire = 50 vampires

The total number of vampires after two nights is the initial vampires plus the new vampires created on the second night:
- Total vampires after 2 nights = 2 initial vampires + 50 new vampires = 52 vampires

To determine the number of vampires after two nights, we start with the initial population of 300 and calculate the number of vampires created each night.

1. **Initial population**: 300 vampires.
2. **Number of vampires created in the first night**:
   - Each vampire turns 5 more people into vampires.
   - Therefore, if there are 300 vampires, the number of new vampires created is \( 300 \times 5 = 1500 \).
   - The total number of vampires after the first night is \( 300 + 1500 = 1800 \).

3. **Number of vampires created in the second night**:
   - Now, we have 1800 vampires.
   - Each of these 1800 vampires turns 5 more people into vampires.
   - Therefore, the number of new vampires created is \( 1800 \times 5 = 9000 \).
   - The total number of vampires after the second night is \( 1800 + 9000 = 10800 \).

So, after two nights, there are 10800 vampires.

On the first night, the two vampires turn 5 people each into vampires, resulting in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 new vampires and the original two vampires, making a total of 2 + 10 = 12 vampires.
On the second night, each of the 12 vampires turns 5 people into vampires, resulting in a total of 12 * 5 = 60 new vampires. However, since the village has a population of only 300, and only 300 - 2 = 298 people can be turned into vampires, we need to subtract the original 2 vampires. The number of new vampires on the second night will be 60 - 2 = 58.
Therefore, after the second night, there will be a total of 12 + 58 = 70 vampires.
