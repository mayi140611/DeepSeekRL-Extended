#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
The $12 video games cost $12 * 80 = $960.
There were 346 - 80 = 266 games remaining.
266 * 50% = 133 of the remaining games cost $7 in total, for 133 * $7 = $931.
133 games cost $3 each giving a total of 133 * $3 = $399.
All total, Daniel spent $960 + $931 + $399 = $2290 on all the games.

Daniel bought 80 games at $12 each, so he spent 80 * $12 = $960 on these games.
Daniel has 346 games, and 80 of them have already been accounted for, so there are 346 - 80 = 266 games left.
50% of these games were bought for $7, which is 50/100 * 266 = 133 games.
So, 133 games were bought at $7 each, and 133 games were bought at $3 each.
Therefore, Daniel spent 133 * $7 + 133 * $3 = $931 + $399 = $1330 on these games.
In total, Daniel spent $960 + $1330 = $2290 on all the games in his collection.

Daniel bought 80 video games for $12 each, so the total cost for these games is 80 * $12 = $960.

The rest of the games in the collection are 346 - 80 = 266.

50% of these remaining games were bought for $7 each, so the number of games bought at this price is 266 / 2 = 133.

So, the total cost for these games is 133 * $7 = $931.

The remaining games were bought at $3 each. The number of such games is 266 - 133 = 133.

So, the total cost for these games is 133 * $3 = $399.

Therefore, Daniel spent $960 + $931 + $399 = $2290 on all games in his collection.

Let's calculate the total cost step by step:

1. Daniel bought 80 games for $12 each:
   $12 × 80 = $960

2. The rest of the games are 346 - 80 = 266 games.

3. 50% of these games were bought for $7 each, so:
   50/100 × 266 = 133 games

   These 133 games cost:
   $7 × 133 = $931

4. The remaining games were bought for $3 each. There are 266 - 133 = 133 of them.

   These 133 games cost:
   $3 × 133 = $399

Adding all these costs together:
$960 + $931 + $399 = $2290

Therefore, the total amount Daniel spent on all the games in his collection is $2290.

The total number of video games is 346, so the number of games that were bought for $7 or more is 346 - 80 = 266.
50% of the games were bought for $7, so the number of games bought for $7 is 266 * 50/100 = 133.
The number of games bought for $3 is 266 - 133 = 133.

The 80 games cost $12 each, so Daniel spent 12 * 80 = $960 on these games.
The total number of games he still had left was 346 - 80 = 266 games.
50% of these 266 had a price of $7, so he had 266 * 50/100 = 133 games at this price.
The 133 games cost 7 * 133 = $931.
All other games cost $3 each, totaling 266 - 133 = 133 games.
They therefore cost 3 * 133 = $399.

First, let's find out how many games are left after the 80 games that were bought for $12 each are accounted for.

346 games - 80 games = 266 games

Out of these 266 games, 50% were bought for $7 each, so we calculate:

50% of 266 games = 0.50 * 266 = 133 games

This means the remaining games were sold at $3 each:

266 games - 133 games = 133 games

Now we can calculate the total cost:

Cost of games bought for $12 each: 80 games * $12/game = $960
Cost of games bought for $7 each: 133 games * $7/game = $931
Cost of games bought for $3 each: 133 games * $3/game = $399

Total cost: $960 (for $12 games) + $931 (for $7 games) + $399 (for $3 games) = $2290

Therefore, Daniel spent $2290 on all the games in his collection.

First, calculate the cost of the games Daniel bought at $12 each. This would be \(80 \times 12 = \$960.\)

Next, find out how many games remain after those 80 were bought. This leaves \(346 - 80 = 266\) games.

Of these remaining games, 50% were bought for $7 each. Calculate the number of games in this group: \(266 \times 50\% = 266 \times 0.5 = 133.\)

These 133 games were bought for $7 each, so their total cost would be \(133 \times 7 = \$931.\)

The rest of the games were bought at $3 each. Therefore, the cost for these games is \(266 - 133 = 133\) games. The total cost for these games with the given price would be \(133 \times 3 = \$399.\).

Add all these costs together to find the total amount Daniel spent on all games: \(960 + 931 + 399 = \$2290.\)
