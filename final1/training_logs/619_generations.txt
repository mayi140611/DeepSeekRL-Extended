system
Let's calculate the number of seagulls step by step.

1. Initially, there are 36 seagulls on the roof.
2. Kids scare away \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the seagulls, which means \(36 \times \frac{1}{4} = 9\) seagulls are scared away.
3. After being scared away, there are \(36 - 9 = 27\) seagulls left.
4. 1/3 of the remaining seagulls fly to McDonald's parking lot, which means \(\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9\) seagulls fly to McDonald's.
5. Therefore, the number of seagulls left is \(27 - 9 = 18\).

So, the number of seagulls left is 18.

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how many seagulls are scared away by the kids. Since 1/4 of the seagulls are scared away, we calculate:
\[
\text{Seagulls scared away} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]
So, after the kids scare away 9 seagulls, the number of seagulls left on the roof is:
\[
36 - 9 = 27
\]
Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining seagulls fly to McDonald's parking lot. Since 1/3 of the 27 seagulls fly away, we calculate:
\[
\text{Seagulls that fly to McDonald's} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]
So, after 9 seagulls fly to McDonald's, the number of seagulls left on the roof is:
\[
27 - 9 = 18
\]

Initially, there are 36 seagulls on the roof of the Taco Bell. Kids scare away 1/4 of them, so 36 * 1/4 = 9 seagulls are scared away. This leaves 36 - 9 = 27 seagulls. Then, 1/3 of the remaining birds fly to McDonald's parking lot, so 27 * 1/3 = 9 seagulls fly away. Therefore, 27 - 9 = 18 seagulls are left.

1. Start with the initial number of seagulls on the Taco Bell roof: \(36\).
2. Kids scare away \(\frac{1}{4}\) of them. To find out how many seagulls got scared away, calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = \frac{36}{4} = 9
   \]
3. Subtract the number of scared seagulls from the initial count to find the number remaining on the roof:
   \[
   36 - 9 = 27
   \]
4. Among the remaining seagulls, \(\frac{1}{3}\) decide to fly to McDonald's parking lot. Calculate \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining seagulls:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
   \]
5. Subtract the number of flying seagulls from the remaining seagulls:
   \[
   27 - 9 = 18
   \]

Therefore, the number of seagulls left is \( 18 \).

Initially, there are 36 seagulls. Kids scare away 1/4 of them, so:

\[ 36 \times \frac{1}{4} = 9 \]

After getting scared away, there are:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Then, 1/3 of the remaining 27 birds fly to McDonald's parking lot, so:

\[ 27 \times \frac{1}{3} = 9 \]

Subtracting the ones that flew away from the remaining seagulls:

\[ 27 - 9 = 18 \]

So, there are 18 seagulls left.

To determine how many seagulls are left, we need to follow the steps systematically:

1. **Calculate the number of seagulls scared away by the kids:**
   - There are 36 seagulls initially.
   - The kids scare away \(\frac{1}{4}\) of them.
   - \(\frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9\) seagulls are scared away.

   After this, the number of seagulls left is:
   \[
   36 - 9 = 27
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of seagulls that fly to McDonald's:**
   - \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 27 seagulls fly to McDonald's.
   - \(\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9\) seagulls fly to McDonald's.

   After this, the number of seagulls left is:
   \[
   27 - 9 = 18
   \]

3. **Final count of seagulls left:**
   - Initially, 36 seagulls were on the roof.
   - 9 were scared away, leaving 27.
   - Then 9 flew to McDonald's, leaving 18.

Thus, the number of seagulls left is:
