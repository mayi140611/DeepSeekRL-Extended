<reasoning>
James buys 200 lotto tickets for $2 each, so he spends $2 * 200 = $400 on tickets. 20% of these tickets are winners, so he has 200 * 0.20 = 40 winning tickets. 80% of these winning tickets win $5 each, so there are 40 * 0.80 = 32 tickets that win $5 each. One of these winning tickets wins the grand prize of $5,000, so he has 32 - 1 = 31 winning tickets that win an average of $10. The remaining tickets that win $5 each can be calculated as 40 - 32 - 1 = 7 tickets. The total amount he won from these 49 winning tickets is 32 * $5 + $5,000 + 7 * $10 = $160 + $5,000 + $70 = $5,230. His total profit is the amount of money he won, which is $5,230, plus the amount of money he spent on the tickets, which is $400. Therefore, his total profit is $5,230 + $400 = $5,630.

To determine James's profit, we need to calculate his total expenses and his total earnings, and then find the difference between them.

First, calculate James's total expenditure:
- James buys 200 lotto tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the total expenditure is \(200 \times 2 = \$400\).

Next, calculate his total earnings:
- James wins 20% of the tickets as winners.
- Therefore, the number of winners is \(200 \times 0.20 = 40\).
- Of these winners, 80% win $5.
- Therefore, the number of winners who win $5 is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\).
- The remaining 20% win an average of $10.
- Therefore, the number of these winners is \(40 \times 0.20 = 8\).
- The total earnings from the winners is \((32 \times 5) + (8 \times 10) = 160 + 80 = \$240\).
- James also wins a grand prize of $5,000.
- Therefore, the total earnings are \(240 + 5000 = \$5240\).

Now, calculate James's profit:
- Profit is total earnings minus total expenditure.
- Therefore, the profit is \(5240 - 400 = \$4840\).

The answer is \(4840\).

Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Calculate total cost of tickets:**
   James buys 200 tickets at $2 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 200 \times 2 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of winning tickets:**
   20% of the 200 tickets are winners.
   \[
   \text{Number of Winners} = 200 \times 0.20 = 40 \text{ tickets}
   \]

3. **Find how many of those winning tickets are for $5 and $10:**
   - 80% of the 40 winning tickets are for $5.
   \[
   \text{Winning Tickets for $5} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ tickets}
   \]
   - The remaining 20% win an average of $10.
   \[
   \text{Winning Tickets for $10} = 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \text{ tickets}
   \]
   - The grand prize ticket is the only winning ticket for $5,000.

4. **Calculate the total winnings:**
   - First, sum the winnings from the $5 tickets.
   \[
   \text{Total Winnings for $5} = 32 \times 5 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Next, sum the winnings from the $10 tickets.
   \[
   \text{Total Winnings for $10} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Add the grand prize.
   \[
   \text{Grand Prize} = 5000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Sum the total winnings:**
   \[
   \text{Total Winnings} = 160 + 80 + 5000 = 5240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is the total winnings minus the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 5240 - 400 = 4840 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Conclusion:**
James made a profit of 4840 dollars.

To calculate James' profit, we need to determine the total cost of the lotto tickets and the total winnings he receives. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total cost of the lotto tickets**: James buys 200 tickets at $2 each.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200 \times 2 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Number of winning tickets**: 20% of 200 tickets are winners.
   \[
   \text{Number of winning tickets} = 200 \times 0.20 = 40 \text{ tickets}
   \]

3. **Number of 5-dollar prizes**: 80% of the winning tickets are for $5.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 prizes} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ tickets}
   \]
   Additionally, there is 1 grand prize of $5,000.

4. **Money from $5 prizes**: Each $5 prize is worth $5.
   \[
   \text{Total from $5 prizes} = 32 \times 5 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Including the grand prize of $5,000:
   \[
   \text{Total from $5 prizes including grand} = 160 + 5000 = 5160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining tickets and winnings**: The remaining 20 winning tickets win an average of $10 each.
   \[
   \text{Total winnings for remaining 20 tickets} = 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total winnings**: Adding up all the winnings:
   \[
   \text{Total winnings} = 5160 + 200 = 5360 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Profit calculation**: Subtract the total cost from the total winnings.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 5360 - 400 = 4960 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, James' profit is $4,960.

To determine James's profit, we'll first calculate the total amount of money he spends and then subtract that from the total amount he wins.

1. **Total Cost**: James buys 200 lotto tickets for $2 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 200 \times 2 = \$400
   \]

2. **Total Winnings**:
   - We know that 20% of the tickets are winners, so the number of winning tickets is:
     \[
     200 \times 0.20 = 40 \text{ tickets}
     \]
   - Out of these 40 winning tickets, 80% are for $5, and 1 is the grand prize of $5,000.
     \[
     \text{Number of tickets winning $5} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
     \]
     \[
     \text{Grand prize ticket} = 1 \text{ ticket}
     \]
   - The remaining 7% win an average of $10 each:
     \[
     \text{Number of $10 tickets} = 40 \times 0.07 = 2.8 \approx 3 \text{ tickets} \quad (\text{rounding to nearest whole number})
     \]
   So, the total winnings can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total Winnings} = (32 \times 5) + 5000 + 3 \times 10
   \]
   \[
   = 160 + 5000 + 30
   \]
   \[
   = 5190 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   James's profit is the total winnings minus the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Winnings} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   = 5190 - 400 = 4790 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Conclusion**:
James's profit is 4,790 dollars.

James bought a total of 200 lotto tickets. Out of these, 20% are winners, which means there are \( 200 \times 0.20 = 40 \) winning tickets. 

80% of the winning tickets are for $5, which means there are \( 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \) tickets that win $5 each. 

1 ticket wins the grand prize of $5,000.

The remaining tickets win an average of $10, so there are \( 40 - 32 - 1 = 7 \) tickets that win an average of $10 each. 

Now, we can calculate the total winnings. The grand prize of $5,000 is a clear winner, and the $5,000 is not included in the $10 average winnings. Therefore, the total value of $10 winnings is \( 7 \times 10 = 70 \). 

The remaining $5 each from tickets winning $5 gives \( 80 \times 5 = 400 \). 

Adding the grand prize to these winnings provides the total profit before subtracting his expenses. The total profit is \( 400 + 400 + 5000 = 5800 \).

We also need to subtract his expenses, which are \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \). 

Therefore, James's profit is \( 5800 - 400 = 5400 \).

First, calculate the total cost of the tickets. James buys 200 tickets at 2 dollars each, so the total cost is \(200 \times 2 = 400\) dollars.

Next, determine the number of winning tickets. Since 20% of the 200 tickets are winners, the number of winning tickets is \(200 \times 0.20 = 40\) tickets.

Then, calculate the winnings from these 40 winning tickets. 80% of these winners win 5 dollars each, so the number of these winners is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\). The total winnings from these 32 tickets is \(32 \times 5 = 160\) dollars.

The grand prize, which is $5,000 is one ticket, so we add that to the winnings: \(160 + 5000 = 5160\) dollars.

Finally, subtract the total cost from the total winnings to find the profit: \(5160 - 400 = 4760\) dollars.

Of these winning tickets, 80% are for $5. This means \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \) tickets win $5. 

The remaining 20% are for $10 and one ticket wins the grand prize of $5,000. This totals \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) tickets that win $10 and 1 ticket that wins $5,000. 

The total winnings from these tickets is:

To determine James' profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lotto tickets, the total winnings, and then subtract the cost from the winnings.

1. **Total cost of the tickets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars per ticket} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Number of winning tickets:**
   \[
   \text{Number of winning tickets} = 200 \text{ tickets} \times 0.20 = 40 \text{ tickets}

3. **Winnings from the 40 winning tickets:**
   - 80% of the winners win $5 each:
     \[
     \text{Winning $5 tickets} = 40 \text{ tickets} \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ tickets}

   - 1 grand prize of $5,000:
     \[
     \text{Total winnings from $5,000} = 1 \text{ ticket} \times 5,000 \text{ dollars per ticket} = 5,000 \text{ dollars}

   - 1 ticket wins an average of $10:
     \[
     \text{Total winnings from $10 ticket} = 1 \text{ ticket} \times 10 \text{ dollars per ticket} = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total winnings:**
   \[
   \text{Total winnings} = 160 \text{ dollars} + 5,000 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 5,170 \text{ dollars}

\[ 40 - 32 - 1 = 7 \text{ $10 winners} \]

6. Calculate the total income from the prizes:
\[ \text{Income from 5-dollar winners} = 32 \text{ tickets} \times \$5 = \$160 \]
\[ \text{Income from the grand prize} = \$5,000 \]
\[ \text{Income from $10 winners} = 7 \text{ tickets} \times \$10 = \$70 \]
\[ \text{Total income from prizes} = \$160 + \$5,000 + \$70 = \$5,230 \]

7. Calculate the net profit:
\[ \text{Net profit} = \text{Total income from prizes} - \text{Total spent on tickets} = \$5,230 - \$400 = \$4,830 \]

To determine James's profit, we need to calculate his total revenue from the lotto tickets and then subtract the total cost of the tickets.

1. **Calculate total cost:** James bought 200 lotto tickets at $2 each.
   - Total cost = 200 tickets * $2/ticket = $400.

2. **Calculate number of winning tickets:** James bought 200 tickets and 20% of them are winners.
   - Number of winning tickets = 200 tickets * 0.20 = 40 tickets.

3. **Calculate the number of second-place winners:** James has 40 winning tickets and 80% of them are for $5.
   - Number of second-place tickets = 40 tickets * 0.80 = 32 tickets.

4. **Calculate the total amount from second-place tickets and grand prize:** James has 32 winning tickets for $5 each and 1 winning ticket for $5,000.
   - Total from second-place tickets = 32 tickets * $5/ticket = $160.
   - Total from grand prize = $5,000.

5. **Calculate the profit from the remaining tickets:** The remaining winning tickets each win an average of $10.
   - Number of remaining tickets = 40 - 32 - 1 = 7 tickets.
   - Total from remaining tickets = 7 tickets * $10/ticket = $70.

6. **Calculate the total profit:** The total profit is the sum of the total amount from second-place tickets, grand prize, and remaining tickets.
   - Total profit = $160 + $5,000 + $70 = $5,230.

7. **Subtract the total cost from the total profit:** The profit is the net gain from the lotto tickets.
   - Profit = $5,230 - $400 = $4,830.

First, we calculate the total cost of the lotto tickets. Since James bought 200 tickets at $2 each, the total cost is $200 \times 2 = $400.

Next, we find out how many of the winning tickets James gets. Since 20% of the tickets are winners, the number of winning tickets is $200 \times 0.2 = 40$.

Of these winning tickets, 80% win $5 each. So there are $40 \times 0.8 = 32$ tickets that win $5 each. One extra ticket wins $5,000 as the grand prize. The remaining winning tickets win an average of $10 each. So we can calculate the total amount won from these tickets, which is $48 \times 10 = $480.

Now, we can find out how much James has made from the winnings. The total winnings from the winning tickets is $5 \times 32 + 5000 + 480 = 160 + 5000 + 480 = $5640. Adding the amount from the extra grand prize ticket, he has made a total of $5640 + 5000 = $10640.

Since he bought 200 tickets, he spent $400, so his total profit is $10640 - $400 = $10240.

     \text{Average amount won by 38 tickets} = 38 \times 10 = 380 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total amount won:**
   Adding up the amounts won by the winning tickets:
   \[
   \text{Total amount won} = 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ dollars} \quad (\text{from 80% of winning tickets}) + 5000 \text{ dollars} + 380 \text{ dollars} = 200 + 5000 + 380 = 5580 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Profit calculation:**
   The profit is the total amount won minus the total amount spent.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 5580 - 400 = 5180 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, James's profit is $5180.
