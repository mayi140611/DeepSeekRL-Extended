###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Mckenna starts her day at 8:00 a.m. She works in her office up to 11:00 a.m. then joins her team of developers at the conference room to talk about projects up to 13:00, from which she works for another two hours and then heads home. How many hours does Mckenna stay at work?

#### ANS ####

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Mckenna starts her work at 8:00 a.m. and stops at 4:00 p.m. (11:00 a.m. + 2 hours = 1 p.m. + 1 hour = 4:00 p.m.).

There are 4 hours in a day and she doesn't include the time from 4:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. as it's not stated in the question.

So, 4 - 3 = 1 hour.
