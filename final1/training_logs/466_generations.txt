system
To find out how far Hadley walked in his boots, we'll add the distances of each trip:

1. From his home to the grocery store: 2 miles
2. From the grocery store to the pet store: 2 - 1 = 1 mile
3. From the pet store back home: 4 - 1 = 3 miles

Now, we add these distances together:

2 (homeward walk) + 1 (to the grocery) + 3 (to the pet store) = 6 miles

To determine the total distance Hadley walked in his boots, we need to add up the distances to the grocery store, the pet store, and back home.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Distance to the grocery store: 2 miles
2. Distance to the pet store: 1 less than two miles, which is \(2 - 1 = 1\) mile less than 2 miles.
3. Distance back home: 1 less than four miles, which is \(4 - 1 = 3\) miles less than 4 miles.
4. Back to the grocery store: To return home, he walked back the same distance he went to the grocery store, which is 2 miles.

Now, let's sum these distances:

\[2 \text{ miles} + 1 \text{ mile} + 3 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the total distance Hadley walked in his boots is 8 miles.

To determine the total distance Hadley walked in his boots, we will calculate the distance for each part of his journey and then sum them up.

1. **Walk from home to the grocery store:**
   Hadley walked 2 miles to the grocery store.
   \[
   \text{Distance to grocery store} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Walk from the grocery store to the pet store:**
   Hadley walked 1 mile less than two miles to the pet store.
   \[
   \text{Distance to pet store} = 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ mile}
   \]

3. **Walk back home:**
   Hadley walked one mile less than four miles back home.
   \[
   \text{Distance back home} = 4 - 1 = 3 \text{ miles}
   \]

Next, we sum the distances from each part of the journey:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance to grocery store} + \text{Distance to pet store} + \text{Distance back home}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance} = 2 \text{ miles} + 1 \text{ mile} + 3 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, Hadley walked a total of 6 miles in his boots.

To determine how far Hadley walked in his boots, we need to add up the distances he walked to each location. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Hadley walked 2 miles to the grocery store.
2. He walked 1 less than two miles to the pet store, which means he walked \(2 - 1 = 1\) mile to the pet store.
3. He then walked one less than four miles back home, which means he walked \(4 - 1 = 3\) miles back home.

Now, we add up all the distances:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} + 1 \text{ mile} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]
