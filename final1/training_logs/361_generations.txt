###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

On the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?

The Skipper sailed the first 1/2 of the total distance at 30 kilometers per hour on 20 hours, which means the distance he covered is (20 * 30)/2 = 300 kilometers.

Since the ship was only one-third of the way to the destination, the ship could have been blown one-third of the distance to the destination in the opposite direction. So, the ship had been blown (300/3) = 100 kilometers in the westward direction.

The Skipper had sailed 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour due east, which means he covered a distance of \(20 \times 30 = 600\) kilometers. After turning off the engines, a wind storm blew the ship 600 kilometers westward, because the storm blew the ship in a westward direction. This is because the journey was to the east and the storm brought the ship back in a westward direction.

The Skipper discovered that after the storm, he was only one-third of the way to his destination. This means up to this point, the Skipper has traveled 1/3 of his total journey. The remaining journey is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the total distance.

If the Skipper had not been blown by the storm, he would have traveled 2/3 of the total distance, which is \(600 \times \frac{2}{3} = 400\) kilometers. Since he actually traveled 600 kilometers, he was blown in a westward direction by:

\[600 - 400 = 200\]

kilometers.

On the first day, the Skipper sailed 20 hours * 30 km/h = 600 km due east.

Since the ship was one-third of the way to his destination, his destination must be 3 * 600 km = 1800 km away.

Therefore, the ship was blown 1800 km - 600 km = 1200 km westward by the storm.

On the first day, the Skipper sailed his ship 20 hours * 30 km/h = 600 km.

So, the Skipper's vessel was 600 km - 0.33 * 600 = 390 km away from his destination.

The Skipper's vessel sailed 600 km - 390 km = 210 km in a westward direction during the storm.

Initially, the Skipper sailed for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, so the distance traveled in this direction is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ kilometers} \]

Since the ship started 100% of the way to the destination, it was initially at:
\[ 100\% = 600 \text{ kilometers} \]

After the storm, the ship was only 33.33% of the way to the destination (which is 1/3 of the total journey). Therefore, the remaining distance to the destination is:
\[ 100\% - 33.33\% = 66.67\% \text{ of } 600 \text{ kilometers} = \frac{2}{3} \times 600 = 400 \text{ kilometers} \]

This means that the ship, after the storm, was 400 kilometers from the initial 600 kilometers. The difference between the initial distance and the distance after the storm gives the distance blown westward by the storm:
\[ 600 - 400 = 200 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, the ship had been blown in a westward direction by the storm for 200 kilometers.

To determine how many kilometers the ship was blown in a westward direction by the storm, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance to the destination.
2. Determine the distance to the destination after the storm.
3. Find the difference between the original distance and the distance after the storm to determine the distance blown westward.

First, calculate the total distance to the destination. Since the ship traveled halfway in 20 hours at 30 kilometers per hour, we can find out the total distance by doubling this:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 2 \times 20 \times 30 = 1200 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Next, determine the distance to the destination after the storm. The Skipper discovered that the ship was only one-third of the way to the destination after the storm, so:

\[
\text{Distance after the storm} = \frac{1}{3} \times 1200 = 400 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Now, to find out how many kilometers the ship was blown in a westward direction by the storm, we need to determine the difference between the total distance and the distance after the storm:

\[
\text{Distance blown westward} = 1200 - 400 = 800 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Therefore, the Skipper's ship had been blown in a westward direction by the storm for 800 kilometers.

On the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, so he sailed a distance of 20*30 = 600 kilometers.
After turning the engines off, the ship was blown in a westward direction, and it was only one-third of the way to the destination when the Skipper checked the GPS. So the ship would have been 3*600 = 1800 kilometers from the destination when the engines were off.
To find out how many kilometers the ship had been blown in a westward direction by the storm, we need to find the difference between the distance the ship would have traveled if it had continued to sail due east and the actual distance it traveled. So the ship would have traveled 1800-600 = 1200 kilometers if it continued to sail due east. The ship actually traveled 600 kilometers, which is half of the distance it would have traveled if it had continued to sail due east. Therefore, the ship had been blown 1200-600 = 600 kilometers westward by the storm.

Initially, the Skipper sailed for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour in a due east direction. The distance covered in this direction is:

\[ 20 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{km/h} = 600 \, \text{km} \]

After the engines were turned off, the ship continued in a westward direction due to the wind storm. Since the ship was only one-third of the way to its destination after the storm, it means it had traveled:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \text{total distance} = \frac{600 \, \text{km}}{3} = 200 \, \text{km} \]

The distance the ship had covered initially in the eastward direction and then in the westward direction is:

\[ 600 \, \text{km} - 200 \, \text{km} = 400 \, \text{km} \]

This 400 km represents the total distance the ship had been blown in a westward direction by the storm.

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how far the ship traveled eastward on the first day. We know the ship traveled at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour for 20 hours, so the distance traveled eastward on the first day is:

\[ 30 \text{ km/h} \times 20 \text{ h} = 600 \text{ km} \]

The ship was supposed to have traveled halfway to the destination, which means the total distance to the destination is:

\[ 600 \text{ km} \times 2 = 1200 \text{ km} \]

After the storm, the ship was one-third of the way to its destination, so the remaining distance to be traveled is:

\[ 1200 \text{ km} \times \frac{2}{3} = 800 \text{ km} \]

The distance the ship was blown westward by the storm is equal to the remaining distance to be traveled after the storm, which is 800 kilometers.

First, we need to determine the total distance to the destination. The Skipper sailed for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, so the distance traveled eastward is \(20 \times 30 = 600\) kilometers. Since this is half the way to the destination, the total distance to the destination is \(600 \times 2 = 1200\) kilometers.

Next, we need to find out where the ship was after the storm. According to the GPS, the ship is one-third of the way to the destination, which means the ship is at \(1200 \times \frac{1}{3} = 400\) kilometers from the starting point.

If the Skipper sailed 600 kilometers to the halfway point and then sailed some distance westward, the remaining distance traveled eastward (before the storm) is \(600 - 400 = 200\) kilometers. This distance represents half of the remaining distance to the destination after the storm.

Since the Skipper travels at a steady speed and the ship covers the remaining distance westward, the distance traveled westward by the ship is \(200 \times 2 = 400\) kilometers.

Thus, the ship had been blown in a westward direction by the storm by 400 kilometers.

To determine how many kilometers the ship was blown in a westward direction by the storm, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance traveled eastward on the first day:
   \[
   \text{Distance Eastward} = 20 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ km/h} = 600 \text{ km}
   \]

2. Since the ship was one-third of the way to the destination, the total distance to the destination is:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 3 \times \text{Distance Eastward} = 3 \times 600 \text{ km} = 1800 \text{ km}
   \]

3. At the end of the first day, the ship was one-third of the way to the destination. Therefore, the distance remaining to the destination is:
   \[
   \text{Distance Remaining} = 2 \times \text{Distance Eastward} = 2 \times 600 \text{ km} = 1200 \text{ km}
   \]

4. This means that the ship was blown backward by the storm to be one-third of the remaining distance. The distance the ship was blown in a westward direction is:
   \[
   \text{Distance Westward} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Distance Remaining} = \frac{1}{3} \times 1200 \text{ km} = 400 \text{ km}

So, the ship was blown 400 kilometers in a westward direction by the storm.

The Skipper sailed 20 hours x 30 kilometers/hour = 600 kilometers due east to halfway.

Let's call the distance the ship was blown westward x.

Therefore, 600 - x is the distance the Skipper sailed to his destination.

Since the ship is only one-third of the way to his destination post-storm, it was sailed 1/3 * 600 = 200 kilometers.

Therefore, 600 - x = 200

Therefore, x = 400

The ship was blown 400 kilometers in a westward direction by the storm.

The new location of the ship is 300 km from the destination.

If the ship were back on the straight line, it would have traveled 300 km + 300 km = 600 km.

But since it traveled 300 km to be blown backward by the wind storm, the distance blown westward would be 600 km - 300 km = 300 km.

To determine how many kilometers the ship had been blown in a westward direction by the storm, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the initial eastward journey and the journey after the storm.

1. **Initial Eastward Journey:**
   - The Skipper sailed due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour.
   - Distance traveled eastward initially: \( 20 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ km/h} = 600 \text{ km} \).

2. **After the Storm, the Ship Was 1/3 of the Way to the Destination:**
   - Let the total distance to the destination be \( D \) kilometers.
   - After the storm, the ship was 1/3 of the way to the destination, so it was 1/3 of \( D \), which is \( \frac{D}{3} \) kilometers from the starting point.

3. **Calculate the Distance Traveled After the Storm:**
   - After the storm, the Skipper's ship was 1/3 of the way to the destination, so it had to travel \( \frac{D}{3} \) kilometers.
   - Since the ship had already traveled 600 kilometers eastward, the remaining distance to be traveled after the storm must account for the eastward part of the journey.
   - Let the distance traveled westward after the storm be \( x \) kilometers. Then the remaining distance to the destination is \( \frac{D}{3} \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The distance traveled eastward is 600 km, and this should be equal to the distance traveled eastward and the distance traveled westward after the storm.
   - Therefore, \( 600 + x = \frac{D}{3} \).

5. **Determine the Total Distance \( D \):**
   - We know that the ship was 1/3 of the way to the destination after the storm, so \( \frac{D}{3} \) is the remaining distance to travel.
   - Let's denote the remaining distance to travel after the storm as \( y \).
   - Since \( \frac{D}{3} \) is the distance left to travel, and from the eastward journey, the remaining distance is \( 600 - x \).

6. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - \( \frac{D}{3} = 600 - x \).

7. **Find the Distance Traveled Westward:**
   - To find the width \( x \), we need to know the total distance to the destination \( D \).
   - Since \( \frac{D}{3} = 600 - x \), and the ship was 1/3 of the way to the destination after the storm, we can set up an equation to solve for \( x \).

8. **Calculate the Total Distance \( D \):**
   - Solving for \( D \) in terms of \( x \), we get:
     \[
     D = 3 \times \left(600 + x\right)
     \]
   - Since \( D \) is total distance to the destination and we need to find the distance traveled westward, the remaining distance \( y \) to be traveled westward is:
     \[
     y = D - 600
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     y = 3 \times \left(600 + x\right) - 600
     \]

9. **Final Calculation:**
   - Simplifying, we find that the distance
