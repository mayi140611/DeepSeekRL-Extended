#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
May will use the red yarns as follows: \(2 \text{ yarns} \times 3 \text{ scarves/yarn} = 6 \text{ scarves}\).

May will use the blue yarns as follows: \(6 \text{ yarns} \times 3 \text{ scarves/yarn} = 18 \text{ scarves}\).

May will use the yellow yarns as follows: \(4 \text{ yarns} \times 3 \text{ scarves/yarn} = 12 \text{ scarves}\).

So, the total number of scarves she can make is \(6 + 18 + 12 = 36\).

#### GENERATION 13 RESPONSE ####

system
To find out how many scarves May can make, we first need to calculate the total number of yarns she has and then multiply it by the number of scarves she can make with each yarn.

May has:
- 2 red yarns
- 6 blue yarns
- 4 yellow yarns

Total number of yarns = 2 red + 6 blue + 4 yellow = 12 yarns

Since she can make 3 scarves with one yarn, the total number of scarves she can make is:

Total scarves = Number of scarves per yarn * Total yarns
Total scarves = 3 scarves/yarn * 12 yarns
Total scarves = 36

So, May will be able to make 36 scarves in total.
