###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Lard decides to share a pizza with his friend Jelly.  He takes a whole, uncut pepperoni pizza and cuts it in half.  He then cuts these halves in half and gives one of the slices to Jelly.  Assuming the pizza started with 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni, how many slices of it are on the slice Lard gives Jelly if 1 of them falls off the slice when Lard picks it up?

system
Initially, the whole pizza has 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni. When Lard cuts the pizza in half, each half gets:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ slices of pepperoni} \]

Lard then cuts each of these halves in half, so each quarter of the pizza still has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ slices of pepperoni} \]

Lard then gives one of these quarter slices to Jelly. When Lard picks up this slice, one slice of pepperoni falls off. Therefore, the slice of pepperoni that Lard gives Jelly has:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ slices of pepperoni} \]

Thus, on the slice Lard gives Jelly, there are 9 slices of pepperoni.

When Lard cuts the pizza, he makes 4 equal pieces. This means each piece will have 40/4 = 10 slices of pepperoni on it. However, one slice falls off when Lard picks it up, so we need to subtract 1 from the total pepperoni on each slice.

Let's analyze the steps of the pizza cutting and the distribution of the slices:

1. The pizza is initially whole and has 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni.
2. The pizza is cut in half, resulting in two halves. Since the pepperoni is evenly spread, each half will have 40/2 = 20 slices of pepperoni.
3. The two halves are then cut in half again, resulting in four quarters. Each quarter will have 20/2 = 10 slices of pepperoni.
4. Lard cuts one of these quarters into two slices, so each slice will have 10/2 = 5 slices of pepperoni.
5. However, one slice falls off when Lard picks it up, so that slice will have fewer pepperoni slices.

Since Lard gives Jelly one of these slices, and one slice falls off and loses one pepperoni slice, the number of pepperoni slices Lard gives Jelly is:

10 slices total - 1 slice after 1 falls off = 9 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices on the slice of pizza that Lard gives Jelly is 9.

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how many slices of pepperoni there are initially on the whole pizza. Since the pizza is cut into halves twice, making four slices total, we see that the whole pizza has 40 slices of pepperoni. 

Next, Lard cuts each of these four slices in half, so each slice becomes 2 smaller pieces. He then gives one of these smaller slices to Jelly. We are told that 1 slice falls off and is therefore no longer on the pizza, so only one full slice of pepperoni remains on the pizza that Jelly receives.

Since the original pizza had 40 slices of pepperoni and only 1 falls off, the remaining number of pepperoni slices is \(40 - 1\). 

Then, we need to account for the fact that Lard only has 2 slices of the pepperoni pizza to begin with after cutting it into quarters, so we can say there are 2 * 2 = 4 pepperoni slices in total.

Thus, it follows that there would be \(40 - 1 = 39\) pepperoni slices remaining on the slice that Lard gives Jelly.

Initially, the whole pizza has 40 slices of pepperoni. After cutting the pizza into 4 equal halves, each half contains:

\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ slices of pepperoni} \]

Next, each of these halves is further cut into 2 smaller halves, resulting in:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ slices of pepperoni per original slice that was cut into two halves} \]

If Lard gives one of these slices to Jelly, and 1 slice falls off when Lard picks it up, then the total number of slices of pepperoni on the slice Lard gives to Jelly is:

\[ 20 - 1 = 19 \text{ slices} \]

So, there are 19 slices of pepperoni on the slice Lard gives Jelly.

<reasoning>
When the pizza is cut into halves, each half will have 40/2 = 20 slices of pepperoni. 

When each of these halves is cut into halves again, each of the original halves will be split into 4 segments, making the pizza consist of 4*20 = 80 slices. Since Lard cuts 2 of these original halves, the number of pepperoni slices he ends up with is 80/2 = 40. 

If 1 slice falls off when Lard picks up the slice, then he gives Jelly 39/2 = 19.5 slices of pepperoni. Since the number of slices must be an integer, we consider that Lard gives Jelly 19 slices if you round down, and 20 slices if you round up.

In case of the slice Lard gives Jelly, Lard has 19 slices, from which 1 falls off, leading to 19 - 1 = 18 slices of pepperoni on the slice that Lard gives Jelly.

After Lard cuts the pizza in half, he has 2 slices. Then, he cuts these halves in half, resulting in 4 slices. He gives one of these slices to Jelly, and before Lard gives this slice to Jelly, one slice falls off when Lard picks it up. Therefore, after this happens, the slice Jelly receives will have an additional portion minus the portion that falls off.

Since the pizza is cut in half, each half will have 40/2 = 20 slices of pepperoni. 

When these halves are each cut in half, each quarter will have 20/2 = 10 slices of pepperoni. 

But one of these quarter slices falls off, leaving 10-1 = 9 slices of pepperoni on the slice Lard gives to Jelly.

Initially, the entire pizza has 40 slices of pepperoni spread evenly. Lard cuts the pizza in half, so each half will have 40/2 = 20 slices of pepperoni. Then, he cuts these quarters in half again, creating eight slices total from each quarter. Therefore, each quarter slice will have 20/2 = 10 slices of pepperoni.

When Lard cuts the whole pizza in half, each half has 40/2 = 20 slices of pepperoni on it. After cutting these halves again in half, each of those quarter slices also has 20/4 = 5 slices of pepperoni on them. Since 1 slice falls off the quarter slice when Lard picks it up, there are now 5 - 1 = 4 slices of pepperoni on the slice he gives Jelly.

At this point, there are still 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni on the whole pizza.

Lard initially cuts the pizza into 2 equal halves, resulting in 2 slices from each cut. Then, he further cuts these halves into 2 equal smaller slices, resulting in 4 slices from each half. Therefore, he ends up with a total of \(2 \times 4 = 8\) slices.

Lard then gives one of these slices to Jelly, and during the process, one slice has a pepperoni slice fall off. This means the slice Jelly receives has 3 slices of pepperoni (since there are 4 original slices, and 1 falls off).

Thus, the number of slices of pepperoni on the slice Lard gives to Jelly is 3.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pepperoni slices on the slice Lard gives to Jelly. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Lard cuts the whole pizza in half, resulting in 2 slices.
2. Each of these slices is further cut in half, leading to 4 slices from the original pizza.
3. One of these slices (the slice given to Jelly) has 1 pepperoni slice fall off when Lard picks it up due to the pepperoni being more spread out.

Therefore, since there were originally 40 pepperoni slices on the whole pizza and one fell off, there are \(40 - 1 = 39\) pepperoni slices left on the slice Lard gives to Jelly.

So, there are 39 slices of it on the slice Lard gives Jelly.

To determine how many slices of pepperoni are on the slice Lard gives to Jelly, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of slices after Lard cuts the pizza:**
   - Initially, the pizza is whole and has 40 slices.
   - Lard cuts it in half, creating 2 slices.
   - He then cuts these halves in half again, resulting in 4 slices in total.

2. **Determine the number of pepperoni slices per slice:**
   - Each slice of the pizza originally has 40 slices of pepperoni.

3. **Consider the pizza cut into quarters:**
   - Since the pizza is cut into quarters and each quarter also has 40 pepperoni slices, there are 16 pepperoni slices across all 4 quarters.

4. **Account for the pepperoni slices that fall off:**
   - When Lard picks up the slice given to Jelly, 1 slice of pepperoni falls off.

5. **Calculate the pepperoni slices on the slice given to Jelly:**
   - The 16 pepperoni slices from all 4 quarters are spread across the 4 quarters.
   - Since 1 slice falls off, the number of pepperoni slices on the slice given to Jelly is:
   \[
   16 - 1 = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pepperoni slices on the slice Lard gives to Jelly is **15**.

Since 1 slice falls off, we need to consider how this affects the remaining slices:

- This leaves 1 slice.

So, there is 1 slice of pepperoni on the slice Lard gives to Jelly.
