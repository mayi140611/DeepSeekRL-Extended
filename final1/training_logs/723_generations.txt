Shara started with 20 shells. On vacation, she found 5 shells per day for 3 days, which means she found \(5 \times 3 = 15\) shells in those days. Additionally, on the fourth day, she found 6 more shells. So, the total number of shells she collected over the vacation is \(15 + 6 = 21\).

Adding the shells she collected on vacation to her initial collection, we get the total number of shells Shara has now:
\[20 (initial) + 21 (collected) = 41 \text{ shells}\]

Therefore, the total number of shells Shara has is 41.

First, we calculate the number of shells Shara found during her vacation. She found 5 shells per day for 3 days, which is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) shells. Additionally, she found 6 shells on the fourth day.

Next, we sum the shells she had before the vacation and the shells she found during the vacation. Initially, she had 20 shells. Adding the shells found during the vacation gives \(20 + 15 + 6 = 41\) shells.

So, Shara now has 41 shells.

To find out how many shells Shara has now, we'll calculate the total number of shells she found during her vacation and add this to the number of shells she initially had.

First, she found 5 shells per day for 3 days, so:
\( 5 \text{ shells/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ shells} \)

Then, she found 6 shells on the fourth day.

Adding all of this to the 20 shells she had initially:
\( 20 \text{ shells} + 15 \text{ shells} + 6 \text{ shells} = 41 \text{ shells} \)

So, the total number of shells Shara has now is 41.

Shara started with 20 shells and found 5 shells per day for 3 days, which means she found an additional \(5 \times 3 = 15\) shells. On the fourth day, she found 6 more shells. So, the total number of shells she found during her vacation can be calculated as follows:
- Shells found on the first 3 days: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)
- Shells found on the fourth day: \(6\)
- Total shells found: \(15 + 6 = 21\)

Adding this to the shells she had before, the total number of shells she has now is:
- Initial shells: 20
- Shells found during vacation: 21
- Total shells now: \(20 + 21 = 41\)

Therefore, Shara has 41 shells now.

To determine the total number of shells Shara has now, we'll break down her collection day by day.

1. **Initial shells**: Shara started with 20 shells.
2. **Found shells during the first 3 days**:
   - Shara found 5 shells per day for 3 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of shells found during these 3 days is \(5 \, \text{shells/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 15 \, \text{shells}\).

3. **Found shells on the fourth day**:
   - Shara found 6 shells on the fourth day.

Now, we'll add up all the shells Shara found during her vacation:
- Initial shells: 20
- Shells found in the first 3 days: 15
- Shells found on the fourth day: 6

Total number of shells:
\[ 20 + 15 + 6 = 41 \]

So, Shara now has 41 shells.

To determine the total number of shells Shara has now, we need to calculate the number of shells she found during her vacation and add it to the number of shells she originally had.

1. Shara started with 20 shells.
2. On the first day of vacation, she found 5 shells. The number of shells found on the first day is 5.
3. On the second day, she found another 5 shells. The number of shells found on the second day is 5.
4. On the third day, she found another 5 shells. The number of shells found on the third day is 5.
5. On the fourth day, she found 6 shells.

We can sum these amounts to find the total number of shells found during the vacation:
\[ 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 21 \]

Now we add this total to the 20 shells she originally had:
\[ 20 + 21 = 41 \]

Therefore, Shara now has 41 shells.

Shara initially had 20 shells. During her first 3 days, she collected 5 shells per day. So, she collected 5 shells/day * 3 days = 15 shells. On the fourth day, she collected 6 additional shells. Therefore, the total number of shells she collected over the vacation is 15 shells + 6 shells = 21 shells.

Adding the shells she found during vacation to the initial amount, the total number of shells Shara has now is 20 initial shells + 21 collected shells = 41 shells.

First, let's calculate how many shells Shara found during her vacation. She found 5 shells per day for 3 days, which totals \(5 \times 3 = 15\) shells. On the fourth day, she found 6 more shells. Therefore, the total number of shells she found is \(15 + 6 = 21\).

Before her vacation, Shara had 20 shells. After finding 21 shells during her vacation, the total number of shells she has now is \(20 + 21 = 41\).

Thus, Shara has 41 shells now.

To find out how many shells Shara has now, we need to calculate the total number of shells she found during her vacation and add that to the number she already had.

1. On the first three days, she found 5 shells per day. So, the total for the first three days is \(5 \text{ shells/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ shells}\).

2. On the fourth day, she found 6 shells.

Therefore, the total number of shells she found during her vacation is \(15 + 6 = 21 \text{ shells}\).

3. Adding the shells she found to the shells she already had, we get \(20 \text{ shells} + 21 \text{ shells} = 41 \text{ shells}\).

So, Shara now has 41 shells.

First, we calculate the number of shells Shara found over the first three days. She found 5 shells per day, so she found \(5 \times 3 = 15\) shells in the first three days. On the fourth day, she found an additional 6 shells. 

Next, we add up all the shells she had before and the shells she found on vacation to get the total number of shells she has now.

\[
20 \text{ (shells before vacation)} + 15 \text{ (shells found in the first three days)} + 6 \text{ (shells found on the fourth day)} 
\]

Now we perform the arithmetic.

\[
20 + 15 = 35
\]

\[
35 + 6 = 41
\]

So, Shara now has 41 shells.

To determine the total number of shells Shara has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells Shara found during her vacation:
   - On the first 3 days, she found 5 shells per day.
     \[
     5 \text{ shells/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ shells}
     \]
   - On the fourth day, she found an additional 6 shells.
     \[
     6 \text{ shells}
     \]
   Therefore, the total number of shells found during the vacation is:
   \[
   15 \text{ shells} + 6 \text{ shells} = 21 \text{ shells}
   \]

2. Add the shells she found during her vacation to the shells she had initially:
   - Shara had 20 shells before going on vacation.
   - She found 21 shells during her vacation.
     \[
     20 \text{ shells} + 21 \text{ shells} = 41 \text{ shells}
     \]

Hence, Shara now has 41 shells.
