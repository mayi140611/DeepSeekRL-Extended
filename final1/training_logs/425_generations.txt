system
Let's denote the number of students in Middle School as \( M \) and the number of students in Elementary School as \( E \).

Given:
\[ M = 50 \]

The problem states that there are three less than four times the number of students in Elementary School compared to Middle School. This can be written as:
\[ E = 4M - 3 \]

Substitute \( M = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ E = 4 \times 50 - 3 \]
\[ E = 200 - 3 \]
\[ E = 197 \]

Now, to find the total number of students in both levels, we add the number of students in Middle School and Elementary School:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = M + E \]
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 50 + 197 \]
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 247 \]

system
Let's denote the number of students in Middle School as M and the number of students in Elementary School as E. According to the problem:

1. M = 50
2. E = 4M - 3

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the equation for E:

E = 4*50 - 3
E = 200 - 3
E = 197

Now, to calculate the total number of students in both levels, we add the number of students in Middle School and Elementary School:

Total = M + E
Total = 50 + 197
Total = 247

Let's denote the number of students in Middle School as \( M \). Given \( M = 50 \).

Let the number of students in Elementary School be denoted as \( E \).

According to the problem, "there are three less than four times the number of students in Elementary School as there are in Middle School," we can express this relationship as:
\[ E = 4M - 3 \]

Substitute \( M = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ E = 4(50) - 3 \]
\[ E = 200 - 3 \]
\[ E = 197 \]

The total number of students in both levels is the sum of students in Elementary School and Middle School:
\[ Total = E + M \]
\[ Total = 197 + 50 \]
\[ Total = 247 \]

system
Let's denote the number of students in Middle School as \( M \) and the number of students in Elementary School as \( E \).

We are given:
- \( M = 50 \)
- \( E = 4M - 3 \)

First, substitute the value of \( M \) into the equation for \( E \):

\[ E = 4 \times 50 - 3 \]

Next, perform the multiplication:

\[ E = 200 - 3 \]

Then, perform the subtraction:

\[ E = 197 \]

Now, to find the total number of students in both levels, we add the number of students in Middle School and Elementary School:

\[ \text{Total} = M + E \]
\[ \text{Total} = 50 + 197 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 247 \]

So, the total number of students in both levels is 247.

Let's denote the number of students in Middle School as \( M \) and the number of students in Elementary School as \( E \).

Given that \( E = 4M - 3 \) and \( M = 50 \):

1. Substitute \( M = 50 \) into the equation \( E = 4M - 3 \):
   \[
   E = 4(50) - 3
   \]
2. Calculate \( 4 \times 50 \):
   \[
   4 \times 50 = 200
   \]
3. Subtract 3 from 200:
   \[
   200 - 3 = 197
   \]
4. Therefore, \( E = 197 \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of students:

5. Add the number of students in Middle School and Elementary School:
   \[
   \text{Total} = M + E
   \]
6. Substitute \( M = 50 \) and \( E = 197 \):
