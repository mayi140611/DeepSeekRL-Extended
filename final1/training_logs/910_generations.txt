<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of grey birds in the cage as G. According to the problem, we have G = 40.

Let \( W \) be the number of white birds next to the cage. The problem states that \( W = G + 6 \), so substituting the value of G, we get \( W = 40 + 6 = 46 \).

After ten minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed and fly away. So, the number of grey birds left in the cage is \( G/2 = 40/2 = 20 \).

The total number of birds remaining is the sum of the grey birds left in the cage and the white birds next to the cage. This is \( 20 + 46 = 66 \).

Initially, we know there are 40 grey birds in the cage. The number of white birds next to the cage is 6 more than this, so there are \(40 + 6 = 46\) white birds.

After ten minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed, so half of the 40 grey birds fly away. This means \(40 / 2 = 20\) grey birds fly away, and the other half remain, which is \(40 / 2 = 20\) grey birds. The number of white birds remains the same at 46.

So, the total number of birds remaining is the sum of the grey birds and white birds: \(20 + 46 = 66\).

Let's denote the number of grey birds in the cage as G and the number of white birds next to the cage as W.

From the given information, we have the following equation:
\[ G = W + 6 \]

We are also given that the number of grey birds in the cage is 40, so:
\[ G = 40 \]

Using the first equation, we can find the number of white birds:
\[ 40 = W + 6 \]
\[ W = 40 - 6 \]
\[ W = 34 \]

So, there are 34 white birds next to the cage.

After ten minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed. Therefore, half of the grey birds fly away:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, 20 grey birds fly away.

The number of grey birds remaining is:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

The number of white birds remains the same after some have flown away:
\[ 34 \]

To find the total number of birds remaining, we add the remaining grey birds and the white birds:
\[ 20 + 34 = 54 \]

So, the total number of birds remaining is 54.

Let's break down the information given:

1. There are six more white birds next to the cage than grey birds in the cage.
2. The number of grey birds in the cage is 40.
3. After ten minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed and fly away.

From the first point, we know that the number of grey birds is 40. According to the second point, the number of white birds next to the cage is 40 + 6 = 46.

The total number of birds initially is the sum of grey and white birds, which is 40 (grey) + 46 (white) = 86 birds.

After ten minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed. This means that half of the 40 grey birds fly away, leaving 40/2 = 20 grey birds.

The total number of birds remaining is the sum of the grey and white birds, which is 20 (grey birds) + 46 (white birds) = 66 birds.

Therefore, the total number of birds remaining is 66.

Given that there are 6 more white birds next to the cage than grey birds in the cage, and the number of grey birds in the cage is 40, the number of white birds next to the cage would be \(40 + 6 = 46\).

The total number of birds initially in the cage is the sum of grey birds and white birds, which is \(40 + 46 = 86\).

After ten minutes, half of the grey birds are freed, so \(40 / 2 = 20\) grey birds fly away, leaving \(40 - 20 = 20\) grey birds.

The number of white birds remains the same since no white birds fly away. So, there are still 46 white birds.

The total number of birds remaining is the sum of grey birds and white birds, which is \(46 + 20 = 66\).

Let's denote the number of white birds next to the cage as \( W \). According to the problem, \( W = 40 + 6 = 46 \). The total number of birds initially in the cage is the sum of the grey birds and the white birds next to the cage, which is \( 40 + 46 = 86 \).

After ten minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed and fly away. So, half of the 86 birds in the cage will fly away, leaving \( \frac{86}{2} = 43 \) birds in the cage. The number of grey birds in the cage remains 40, as they are not freed or added to the total number of birds.

The total number of birds remaining is the sum of the grey birds and the remaining white birds. Since 40 grey birds remain in the cage, and 46 white birds are still next to the cage, the total number of birds remaining is \( 40 + 46 = 86 \).

Therefore, the total number of birds remaining is 86.

Initially, there are 40 grey birds in the cage. There are also 6 more white birds next to the cage than grey birds, which means there are \(40 + 6 = 46\) white birds. Therefore, the total number of birds initially is \(40 + 46 = 86\).

Next, after ten minutes, half of the grey birds in the cage are freed and fly away. This means that \(40 / 2 = 20\) grey birds are freed. The total number of birds remaining is therefore the grey birds that stayed in the cage (20) plus the white birds (46). This gives \(20 + 46 = 66\) birds remaining.

First, let's determine the number of white birds next to the cage. According to the problem, there are 6 more white birds than grey birds in the cage. Given that there are 40 grey birds, we can calculate the number of white birds as follows:

\[
\text{Number of white birds} = 40 \text{ grey birds} + 6 = 46 \text{ white birds}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total number of birds after 10 minutes. Initially, there are:

\[
46 \text{ white birds} + 40 \text{ grey birds} = 86 \text{ birds}
\]

After 10 minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed. Since half of the grey birds are freed, the number of grey birds left in the cage is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grey birds}
\]

Therefore, the number of birds remaining is:

\[
46 \text{ white birds} + 20 \text{ grey birds} = 66 \text{ birds}
\]

Thus, the total number of birds remaining is 66.

Let's denote the number of grey birds in the cage as \( G \) and the number of white birds next to the cage as \( W \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ W = G + 6 \]
Given that the number of grey birds in the cage \( G \) is 40, we can substitute \( G \) with 40:
\[ W = 40 + 6 = 46 \]

Now, after ten minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed. Therefore, the number of grey birds that fly away is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]
And the number of white birds that fly away is also:
\[ \frac{46}{2} = 23 \]

Before the birds in the cage were freed, the total number of birds before ten minutes was:
\[ G + W = 40 + 46 = 86 \]
After ten minutes, the number of birds that remain is:
\[ 86 - (20 + 23) = 86 - 43 = 43 \]

So, the total number of birds remaining is 43.

Let's start by defining the variables for the number of grey birds and white birds. Let \( G \) be the number of grey birds in the cage, and \( W \) be the number of white birds next to the cage. According to the problem, \( G = 40 \). Additionally, the problem states that there are six more white birds next to the cage than grey birds in the cage, so we can write the equation:
\[ W = G + 6 \]
Substituting the value of \( G \) into the equation, we get:
\[ W = 40 + 6 = 46 \]
So initially, there are 40 grey birds and 46 white birds next to the cage. 

Next, we need to determine how many birds fly away after ten minutes. Since half of the birds in the cage fly away, there will be:
\[ \frac{W}{2} = \frac{46}{2} = 23 \]
birds remaining in the cage. Adding these to the 40 grey birds outside the cage, the total number of birds remaining is:
\[ 43 + 23 = 66 \]

So the total number of birds remaining is \( 66 \).

We start by determining the number of white birds next to the cage. According to the information given, there are six more white birds next to the cage than grey birds in the cage. If there are 40 grey birds in the cage, then the number of white birds is \(40 + 6 = 46\). 

After ten minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed, which means that half of the grey birds remain and half are freed. Since the number of grey birds is 40, half of them, which is 20, will fly away. Thus, only 20 grey birds remain in the cage.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds remaining. There are 20 grey birds and 46 white birds, giving a total of \(20 + 46 = 66\) birds remaining.

Let's denote the number of grey birds in the cage as G and the number of white birds next to the cage as W. According to the problem, we have G = 40 and W = G + 6.

Substituting the value of G into the equation for W, we get W = 40 + 6 = 46.

So, there are 40 grey birds in the cage and 46 white birds next to the cage initially.

After 10 minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed and fly away. So, half of the 40 grey birds fly away, leaving 20 grey birds.

The total number of birds remaining is therefore the sum of the grey birds and the white birds, which is 20 grey + 46 white = 66 birds.

Given that there are six more white birds next to the cage than grey birds in the cage, we can calculate the number of white birds as follows:
Number of white birds = Number of grey birds + 6
Number of white birds = 40 + 6
Number of white birds = 46

After ten minutes, half of the grey birds in the cage are freed, so the number of grey birds remaining in the cage is:
Number of grey birds remaining = 40 / 2
Number of grey birds remaining = 20

Now, to find the total number of birds remaining, we need to add the number of grey birds remaining and the number of white birds:
Total number of birds remaining = Number of grey birds remaining + Number of white birds
Total number of birds remaining = 20 + 46
Total number of birds remaining = 66
