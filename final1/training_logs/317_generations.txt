To find out how many hours Madeline has left over, we need to subtract the time she spends in class, working on homework, sleeping, and working part-time from the total number of hours in a week (168 hours).

First, let's calculate the hours Madeline spends in class each week. Since she spends 18 hours a week in class, we have:

\[
18 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate her total sleep time per week. Since she sleeps 8 hours a day, we have:

\[
8 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 56 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, let's calculate her time spent working on homework per week. Since she spends 4 hours a day working on homework, we have:

\[
4 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we add up all the weekly hours that Madeline spends, except for the 20 hours she works part-time:

Total weekly hours spent = hours in class + hours sleeping + hours working on homework - hours working part-time

\[
18 + 56 + 28 - 20 = 102 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, let's subtract this total from the total hours in a week:

\[
168 \text{ hours} - 102 \text{ hours} = 66 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Madeline has 66 hours left over.

To determine how many hours Madeline has left over, we need to calculate the time she spends on various activities and subtract it from the total hours in a week.

1. Total weekly hours in a week: 7 days * 24 hours/day = 168 hours
2. Time spent in class: 18 hours/week
3. Time spent on homework per day: 4 hours/day
   Total time spent on homework per week: 4 hours/day * 7 days/week = 28 hours/week
4. Time spent sleeping per day: 8 hours/day
   Total time spent sleeping per week: 8 hours/day * 7 days/week = 56 hours/week
5. Time spent working part-time: 20 hours/week

Now, let's calculate the total hours spent on all these activities.

Total time spent on activities = Time spent in class + Time spent on homework + Time spent sleeping + Time spent working
                            = 18 hours + 28 hours + 56 hours + 20 hours
                            = 122 hours

Finally, subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a week to find the hours left over.

Hours left over = Total hours in a week - Total time spent on activities
               = 168 hours - 122 hours
               = 46 hours

Therefore, Madeline has 46 hours left over.

To calculate the total hours Madeline spends on different activities, we can add up the time for each activity.

Time spent in class: 18 hours/week
Time spent on homework: 4 hours/day * 7 days/week = 28 hours/week
Time spent sleeping: 8 hours/day * 7 days/week = 56 hours/week
Time spent working part-time: 20 hours/week

Total hours spent: 18 hours/class + 28 hours/homework + 56 hours/sleeping + 20 hours/part-time work = 122 hours/week

Now, we subtract the total hours spent from the total hours in a week to find out how many hours are left over.

Total hours in a week: 7 days/week * 24 hours/day = 168 hours/week

Hours left over: 168 hours/week - 122 hours/week = 46 hours/week

To determine how many hours Madeline has left over, we need to account for all her activities and subtract them from the total number of hours in a week.

1. Total hours in a week: 168
2. Hours spent in class: 18
3. Hours spent on homework: 4 hours/day * 7 days = 28 hours

5. Hours spent working part-time: 20 hours/week

Now, let's sum up all her activities and subtract from the total hours in a week:

Total activities hours = (hours in class) + (hours on homework) + (hours sleeping) + (hours working)
Total activities hours = 18 + 28 + 56 + 20 = 122 hours

First, we need to determine the total number of hours Madeline spends on all her activities. Since there are 7 days in a week, she spends:

- 18 hours per week in class
- 4 hours per day working on homework, so \(4 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ hours/week}\)
- 8 hours per day sleeping, so \(8 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 56 \text{ hours/week}\)
- 20 hours per week working part-time

Adding up all these hours gives her total weekly hours of activities:

\[
18 \text{ hours/week} + 28 \text{ hours/week} + 56 \text{ hours/week} + 20 \text{ hours/week} = 122 \text{ hours/week}

Since there are 168 hours in a week:

\[
168 \text{ hours/week} - 122 \text{ hours/week} = 46 \text{ hours/week}

1. Class: 18 hours
2. Homework: 48 hours (since 24 hours/day * 2 days = 48 hours)
3. Sleep: 168 hours - (18 + 48 + 8 + 20) = 168 - 94 = 74 hours

We can solve this by subtracting the total hours Madeline spends in class, on homework, and sleeping from the total number of hours in a week.

First, we calculate the total hours Madeline spends on homework and sleeping:
- Homework: 4 hours/day * 7 days/week = 28 hours/week
- Sleeping: 8 hours/day * 7 days/week = 56 hours/week

Next, we add the time spent in class, homework, and sleeping:
- Time in class: 18 hours/week

Now, we add the part-time job hours:
- Part-time job: 20 hours/week

Finally, we calculate the remaining hours by subtracting the total time spent from the total hours in a week:
Total hours in a week: 168 hours/week

Remaining hours: 168 hours/week - (18 hours + 28 hours + 56 hours + 20 hours)
= 168 hours/week - 122 hours
= 46 hours

<reasoning>
Madeline spends 4 hours per day on homework, 8 hours per day on sleep, and 18 hours per week in class.
We add these up to get the total time spent per week: 4 * 7 + 8 * 7 + 18 = 28 + 56 + 18 = 102 hours.
102 - 168 = -66 hours which is not physically possible, an error is made.
The difference between 102 and 168 is 168 - 102 = 66 hours.

We can simplify the calculation:
Total working hours: 4 * 7 + 8 * 7 + 8 * 2 + 56 = 28 + 56 + 16 + 56 = 158 hours.
158 - 168 = -10 hours, which is incorrect. Let's correct this.
158 - 168 = -10 - (-66) = 56 hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Madeline spends on her usual activities in a week. This includes:

- Class hours: 18 hours
- Homework: 4 hours/day * 7 days = 28 hours
- Sleeping: 8 hours/day * 7 days = 56 hours
- Part-time work: 20 hours

Now, let's add these up:

Total usual activities = 18 + 28 + 56 + 20 = 122 hours

Madeline also works 8 hours per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, her total working time in a week is:

Total working time = 8 hours/day * 7 days = 56 hours

Now, let's subtract the total hours for usual activities and working time from the total possible hours in a week, which is 7 days * 24 hours/day = 168 hours:

Remaining hours = Total possible hours - Total usual activities - Working time
Remaining hours = 168 hours - 122 hours - 56 hours
Remaining hours = 168 hours - 178 hours = -10 hours

There seems to be an error in the calculation. Let's recheck the total usual activities calculation. The total usual activities should be:

Total usual activities = 18 hours + 4 hours/day * 7 days + 8 hours/day * 7 days + 20 hours (from the part-time job)

Now, let's perform the correct calculation:

Total usual activities = 18 + 4*7 + 8*7 + 20 = 18 + 28 + 56 + 20 = 122 hours

In addition to usual activities, Madeline spends 8 hours per day sleeping, which amounts to:

Total remaining hours = 168 hours - 122 hours - 56 hours = 168 - 178 = -10 hours

This result doesn't make sense because the total hours spent on typical activities exceed the total possible hours in a week, indicating she would overwork. The original explanation had a logical mistake in not considering the total hours spent on sleeping.

Given the calculation as is, it implies that Madeline would have 168 - 178 = -10 hours, which doesn't make sense because time cannot be negative in this context.

I apologize for the confusion. Let's correct the approach and recalculate:

- Total time in a week: 168 hours
- Time spent on usual activities: 122 hours
- Time spent on sleeping: 56 hours
- Time spent working part-time: 20 hours

Correct total time spent on usual activities: 
122 hours

Correct remaining hours in a week: 
168 hours - 122 hours = 46 hours

Therefore, the correct answer should be 46 hours left over.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class. That's a total of 18 hours.

2. She spends 4 hours per day on homework. Since there are 7 days in a week, she spends \(4 \times 7 = 28\) hours on homework in a week.

3. She sleeps for 8 hours per day. With 7 days in a week, she spends \(8 \times 7 = 56\) hours sleeping.

4. Her part-time job is 20 hours per week.

Now, let's add up all the hours she spends:

- Class: 18 hours
- Homework: 28 hours
- Sleep: 56 hours
- Job: 20 hours

Total hours = 18 + 28 + 56 + 20 = 122 hours

Since there are 168 hours in a week (24 hours/day * 7 days), we subtract the total hours from 168:

168 - 122 = 46 hours

Therefore, Madeline has 46 hours left over each week.

To find out how many hours Madeline has left over, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she spends on various activities in a week and then subtract that from the total number of hours in a week.

1. Total hours per week = 18 hours (in class) + 4 hours (homework) * 7 days (assuming 7 days in a week) + 8 hours (sleeping) * 7 days + 20 hours (part-time job)
2. Total hours per week = 18 + 28 + 56 + 20
3. Total hours per week = 122

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of hours in a week:
4. Total hours in a week = 24 hours/day * 7 days = 168 hours

Now, we can subtract the total hours spent on various activities from the total hours in a week to find the hours left over:
5. Hours left over = Total hours in a week - Total hours spent on various activities
6. Hours left over = 168 hours - 122 hours = 46 hours

However, it's not possible to have 46 hours left over if she spends 122 hours in total in a week, as 122 is already more than the 168 hours there are in a week.

To determine how many hours Madeline has left over each week, we need to calculate the total number of hours she spends on various activities and then subtract that from the total number of hours in a week (168 hours).

First, let's calculate the number of hours Madeline spends on classes, homework, and sleeping:

1. Class time: 18 hours per week
2. Homework time: 4 hours per day x 7 days = 28 hours per week
3. Sleep time: 8 hours per day x 7 days = 56 hours per week

Now, let's add up all the time spent on these activities:

Total time spent = Class time + Homework time + Sleep time
Total time spent = 18 hours + 28 hours + 56 hours
Total time spent = 102 hours per week

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours in a week:

Total hours in a week = 168 hours

Now, subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a week to find out how many hours Madeline has left over:

Hours left over = Total hours in a week - Total time spent
Hours left over = 168 hours - 102 hours
Hours left over = 66 hours

Therefore, Madeline has 66 hours left over each week.

To find out how many hours Madeline has left over, we need to subtract the hours she spends on each activity from the total number of hours in a week.

First, let's convert the weekly hours spent on class and homework to a weekly total:
- Hours spent in class per week: 18 hours
- Hours spent working on homework per day: 4 hours
- Hours spent sleeping per day: 8 hours

Now let's calculate these totals:
- Weekly homework time: \(4 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ hours}\)
- Weekly sleep time: \(8 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 56 \text{ hours}\)
- Part-time work time: 20 hours

Next, we sum up these totals and subtract from the weekly hours in a week (168):
\[ \text{Weekly total} = 168 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total spent} = 18 \text{ hours (class)} + 28 \text{ hours (homework)} + 56 \text{ hours (sleep)} + 20 \text{ hours (work)} = 122 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how many hours Madeline has left over, we need to account for all her weekly activities. 

First, let's calculate the total weekly hours she spends in class, working on homework, and sleeping. 

In class: 18 hours
Homework: 4 hours/day * 7 days (assuming a 7-day week) = 28 hours
Sleeping: 8 hours/day * 7 days = 56 hours

Next, let's add up all the hours spent on these activities:

18 hours (class) + 28 hours (homework) + 56 hours (sleeping) = 102 hours

Madeline works part-time for 20 hours each week. 

Now, subtract the total hours spent on her core activities (class, homework, and sleeping) from the total weekly hours in a week:

168 hours (total weekly hours in a week) - 102 hours (hours spent on activities) - 20 hours (part-time work) = 46 hours

So, after accounting for all her activities, Madeline has 46 hours left over.
