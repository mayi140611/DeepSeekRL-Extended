###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Carla needs to drive her car to do a bunch of errands. She needs to drive 8 miles to the grocery store, 6 miles to pick up her kids from school, 12 miles to drop her kids off at soccer practice, and twice the distance from the school to soccer practice to get everyone home again. If Carla's car gets 25 miles per gallon, and gas costs $2.50, how much will Carla have to spend on gas for her trip?

#### ANS ####

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
The total distance Carla will drive is the sum of all the individual distances: 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 50 miles. 

Given that her car gets 25 miles per gallon, the number of gallons needed for the trip is 50 / 25 = 2 gallons.

At a rate of $2.50 per gallon, Carla will spend 2 * $2.50 = $5 on gas for her trip.

The total distance Carla will drive is calculated by adding all the individual distances: 8 + 6 + 12 + 2(12) = 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 4朋. 

We then calculate the total gallons of gas needed by dividing the total distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 4朋 ÷ 25朋/gallon = 0.16朋.

To find out how much Carla will spend on gas, we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon: 0.16朋 × $2.50/gallon = $0.40.

First, let's calculate the total distance Carla needs to drive:

- To the grocery store: 8 miles
- To pick up her kids: 6 miles
- To drop her kids off at soccer practice: 12 miles
- To get everyone home again: 2 * 12 miles = 24 miles

Total distance = 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 50 miles

Next, we'll calculate the amount of gas needed to cover this distance:

1 gallon = 25 miles
50 miles / 25 miles per gallon = 2 gallons

Finally, we'll calculate the cost of the gas:

2 gallons * $2.50 per gallon = $5.00

Therefore, Carla will have to spend $5.00 on gas for her trip.

First, let's calculate the total distance Carla needs to drive. She drives 8 miles to the grocery store, 6 miles to pick up her kids from school, 12 miles to drop her kids off at soccer practice, and to get everyone home again, which is twice the distance from the school to soccer practice. Thus, she drives \(12 \times 2 = 24\) miles to get everyone home again.

The total distance for the trip is:

\[
8 \text{ (grocery store)} + 6 \text{ (school)} + 12 \text{ (soccer practice)} + 24 \text{ (return home)} = 4兼 (total distance)
\]

Next, let's calculate how many gallons of gas Carla needs for her trip. Given her car gets 25 miles per gallon, and she drives 45 miles, we find the amount of gas needed:

\[
\frac{45 \text{ miles}}{25 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 1.80 \text{ gallons}
\]

To determine the cost of gas, we multiply the number of gallons needed by the cost per gallon. Given gas costs $2.50 per gallon:

\[
1.80 \times 2.50 = 4.50
\]

Therefore, Carla will have to spend $4.50 on gas for her trip.

To calculate the total distance Carla needs to drive, we first list out all the distances:

- To the grocery store: 8 miles
- To pick up her kids from school: 6 miles
- To drop her kids off at soccer practice: 12 miles
- From soccer practice to home: 2 * 12 = 24 miles

Now, let's add these distances together to find the total distance:

\( 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 50 \) miles

Carla's car gets 25 miles per gallon, so we can calculate how many gallons of gas she will need for the 50-mile trip:

\( \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{25 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 2 \text{ gallons} \)

If gas costs $2.50 per gallon, the total cost of gas for the trip will be:

First, we need to calculate the total distance Carla will drive. The distance to the grocery store is 8 miles, to pick up her kids from school is 6 miles, to drop her kids off at soccer practice is 12 miles, and to get everyone home again is twice the distance from the school to soccer practice, which is 2 * 12 = 24 miles. Adding these distances together gives us:

8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 50 miles

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Carla will need. Since her car gets 25 miles per gallon and the total distance is 50 miles, we divide the total distance by the car's mileage to find the number of gallons needed:

50 miles / 25 miles per gallon = 2 gallons

Now, we calculate the cost of the gas. Given that the cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, we multiply the number of gallons by the price per gallon:

2 gallons * $2.50 per gallon = $5.00

First, we need to calculate the total distance Carla needs to drive. The distances for each segment of her trip are given as follows:
- 8 miles to the grocery store
- 6 miles to pick up her kids from school
- 12 miles to drop her kids off at soccer practice
- Twice the distance from the school to soccer practice to get everyone home again

Calculating twice the distance from school to soccer practice:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's add all these distances together to find the total distance:
\[ 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 50 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas she will need. Given that her car gets 25 miles per gallon, the amount of gas needed for 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{25 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 2 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since gasoline costs $2.50 per gallon, the total cost for 2 gallons of gas is:
\[ 2 \text{ gallons} \times 2.50 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Carla will have to spend $5.00 on gas for her trip.

Adding all these distances together gives us:

3. From soccer practice back to her kids' school: 12 miles (twice the distance from school to soccer practice)
4. From the kids' school to her house: 6 miles (twice the distance from school to soccer practice)

Total distance = 8 miles + 6 miles + 12 miles + 6 miles = 32 miles

Now, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas Carla will need. Her car gets 25 miles per gallon.

Total gallons needed = Total distance / Miles per gallon
Total gallons needed = 32 miles / 25 miles per gallon = 1.28 gallons

Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the gas.

To determine how much Carla will spend on gas, we first need to calculate the total distance she will drive for her errands.

1. **Distance to the grocery store**: 8 miles
2. **Distance to pick up kids from school**: 6 miles
3. **Distance to drop kids off at soccer practice**: 12 miles
4. **Distance to get everyone home again**: Twice the distance from school to soccer practice, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) miles

Now, we add all these distances together to find the total mileage:

\[
8 \, \text{miles} + 6 \, \text{miles} + 12 \, \text{miles} + 24 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we use the distance to calculate the amount of gas Carla needs. Her car gets 25 miles per gallon (mpg), so we use the formula:

\[
\text{ gallons of gas needed} = \frac{\text{total miles}}{\text{miles per gallon}} = \frac{50 \, \text{miles}}{25 \, \text{miles per gallon}} = 2 \, \text{gallons}
\]

Given that gas costs $2.50 per gallon, we calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{total cost} = \text{gallons of gas needed} \times \text{cost per gallon} = 2 \, \text{gallons} \times 2.50 \, \text{dollars per gallon} = 5 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Therefore, Carla will spend $5 on gas for her trip.
