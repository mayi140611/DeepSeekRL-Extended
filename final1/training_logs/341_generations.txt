###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Samuel swept the porch and cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from it. As he walked across the porch afterward, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind. How many dust particles were on the porch before Samuel swept if there were 331 after he walked across it?

#### ANS ####

1080
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the total number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept as \( x \).

After sweeping nine-tenths of the dust particles, the remaining dust particles are one-tenth of the original amount. So, we have:
\[ x - \frac{9}{10}x = \frac{x}{10} \]
This reduces to:
\[ x - 0.9x = 0.1x \]

After Samuel walked across the porch and left 223 dust particles behind, the total number of dust particles on the porch became 331:
\[ 0.1x + 223 = 331 \]

Now we solve for \( x \):
\[ 0.1x = 331 - 223 \]
\[ 0.1x = 108 \]
\[ x = \frac{108}{0.1} \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the total number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept was 1080.

Let's denote the initial number of dust particles on the porch as \( x \).

After sweeping, 9/10 of the dust particles were cleared, leaving 1/10 of the dust particles behind. Thus, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{10} x = 223 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:
\[ x = 223 \times 10 \]
\[ x = 2230 \]

So, the initial number of dust particles on the porch was 2230.

The answer is 2230.

To find out how many dust particles were on the porch before Samuel swept, we need to subtract the number of dust particles he left behind by walking from the total number of dust particles after he walked across it.

There were 331 dust particles after Samuel walked across it. He left 223 dust particles behind.

So, the number of dust particles on the porch before he swept was:
\(331 - 223 = 108\)

Therefore, there were 108 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept.

Let's denote the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept as \( x \).

According to the given information, Samuel swept the porch and cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from it. This means that one-tenth of the dust particles remained on the porch. Therefore, the number of dust particles before Samuel swept is equal to the number of dust particles after he swept, which is 331. 

So, we have the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{10}x = 331
\]

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:
\[
x = 331 \times 10 = 3310
\]

Now, let's consider the dust particles left behind by Samuel's shoes. After walking across the porch, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind. This means that there were 223 dust particles more on the porch than there were after Samuel swept it.

Therefore, the number of dust particles before Samuel swept is the number of dust particles after he swept plus the dust particles left behind by his shoes:
\[
x = 331 + 223 = 554
\]

So, there were 554 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept.

Let \( x \) be the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept. After sweeping, \( 9/10 \) of the dust particles remained, and Samuel's shoes left 223 dust particles behind. His shoes then covered the remaining \( 1/10 \) of the particles, which led to 331 dust particles on the porch.

We can set up the following equation based on the information provided:

\[ 223 = \frac{1}{10} x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 223 \times 10 \]
\[ x = 2230 \]

Therefore, there were 2230 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept.

Samuel swept the porch and cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from it, leaving one-tenth of the original dust particles after sweeping. The number of dust particles left after Samuel swept is 331.

To find out how many dust particles were on the porch before he swept, you can calculate:

\[ x \times \frac{1}{10} = 331 \]
\[ x = 331 \times 10 \]
\[ x = 3310 \]

So, there were 3310 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept.

<answer>
3310
</answer>
<reasoning>
The number of dust particles left after sweeping is 331. Since Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust, this means one-tenth of the original dust was left behind after sweeping. Therefore, the original number of dust particles is 10 times the number of dust particles left behind.

Let's denote the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept as \( x \).

After sweeping, nine-tenths of the dust particles were cleared, so one-tenth remained. This means after sweeping, there were \( \frac{x}{10} \) particles left. 

Samuel then walked across the porch, leaving 223 dust particles behind. This means that the total number of particles before he walked across minus the number of particles he left equals the number of particles after he walked across plus the 223 particles he left behind.

So we have:
\[ \frac{x}{10} - 223 = 331 + 223 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{x}{10} = 331 + 223 + 223 \]
\[ \frac{x}{10} = 777 + 223 \]
\[ \frac{x}{10} = 1000 \]
\[ x = 1000 \times 10 \]
\[ x = 10000 \]

So, there were 10000 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept.

Let the initial number of dust particles on the porch be denoted as \( x \).

After sweeping, Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles, leaving one-tenth of the particles behind. Therefore, before he walked across the porch, the number of dust particles was \( \frac{x}{10} \).

After Samuel walked across the porch, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind, so the number of dust particles on the porch before he walked across was \( \frac{x}{10} + 223 \).

According to the problem, after Samuel walked across the porch, there were 331 dust particles on the porch. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{x}{10} + 223 = 331
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( \frac{x}{10} \) by subtracting 223 from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{10} = 331 - 223
\]
\[
\frac{x}{10} = 108
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10:
\[
x = 108 \times 10
\]
\[
x = 1080
\]

Thus, the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept is \(\boxed{1080}\).

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the dust particles before and after Samuel's actions. When Samuel swept the porch, he cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles. This means that 1/10th of the particles remained after he swept. After his walk across the porch, he left 223 dust particles behind.

Let's denote the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept them as \( x \). After sweeping, \( \frac{1}{10}x \) of these particles remained, and after Samuel's walk, 223 particles were left behind. Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{10}x + 223 = 331 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. First, subtract 223 from both sides:

\[ \frac{1}{10}x = 331 - 223 \]

\[ \frac{1}{10}x = 108 \]

Now, multiply both sides by 10 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 108 \times 10 \]

\[ x = 1080 \]

So, there were 1080 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept them.

Let's denote the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it as \( x \).

After sweeping, 9/10 of the dust particles were left on the porch. So, \( \frac{9}{10}x \) dust particles remained after the sweeping.

Samuel then walked across the porch, leaving 223 dust particles behind. This means that the number of dust particles left on the porch after he walked across it is \( \frac{9}{10}x + 223 \).

According to the problem, this number is 331. So we have the equation:

\[ \frac{9}{10}x + 223 = 331 \]

To solve for \( x \), let's first subtract 223 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{9}{10}x = 331 - 223 \]
\[ \frac{9}{10}x = 108 \]

Now, to get \( x \) by itself, we can multiply both sides by \( \frac{10}{9} \):

\[ x = 108 \times \frac{10}{9} \]
\[ x = 12 \times 10 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, there were 120 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it.
