system
Initially, Haruto had 127 tomatoes. After the birds ate 19 tomatoes, he had \(127 - 19 = 108\) tomatoes left. 

Next, he picked half of the remaining tomatoes for himself, which means he went through \(108 / 2 = 54\) tomatoes and then had \(108 - 54 = 54\) tomatoes left.

So, Haruto has 54 tomatoes left.

To find out how many tomatoes Haruto has left after giving half of his tomatoes to his friend, we can follow these steps:

1. Initially, Haruto has 127 tomatoes.
2. Birds ate 19 of the tomatoes. To find out how many tomatoes are left after this, we subtract the number of tomatoes eaten by birds from the total:
   \[
   127 - 19 = 108
   \]
3. Haruto then gives half of his remaining tomatoes to his friend. To find half of 108, we divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{108}{2} = 54
   \]

So, Haruto has 54 tomatoes left.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes Haruto picked after the birds ate some. This year, the plants grew 127 tomatoes and birds ate 19 of them. So the number of tomatoes left after the birds ate some would be:

\[127 - 19 = 108\]

Next, Haruto gave half of the remaining tomatoes to his friend. Half of 108 tomatoes would be:

\[108 \div 2 = 54\]

So, Haruto gave 54 tomatoes to his friend. Therefore, the number of tomatoes he has left is:

\[108 - 54 = 54\]

Haruto originally had 127 tomatoes. The birds ate 19 of them, so he had:

\[ 127 - 19 = 108 \text{ tomatoes} \]

He then picked the rest, so:

\[ 108 - 0 = 108 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, he gave half of his tomatoes to his friend:

\[ \frac{108}{2} = 54 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, he has 54 tomatoes left.

To find out how many tomatoes Haruto has left, let's follow these steps:

1. Haruto initially had 127 tomatoes.
2. Birds ate 19 of the tomatoes, so we subtract those:

   127 - 19 = 108 tomatoes left.

3. Haruto then picked the rest, so he has 108 tomatoes after picking.

4. He gave half of his tomatoes to his friend. Half of 108 is:

   108 รท 2 = 54.

5. So, after giving half to his friend, Haruto would have 54 tomatoes left.

Initially, Haruto had 127 tomatoes. The birds ate 19 of them, so he had \( 127 - 19 = 108 \) tomatoes left. He then picked the rest of the tomatoes, which means he picked \( 108 \) tomatoes and then gave half of that to his friend. So he gave \( \frac{108}{2} = 54 \) tomatoes to his friend, which means he had \( 108 - 54 = 54 \) tomatoes left.

First, we need to determine the number of tomatoes Haruto picked after the birds ate some. He initially harvested 127 tomatoes, and the birds ate 19 of them. So, the number of tomatoes Haruto picked is:

\[ 127 - 19 = 108 \]

Next, Haruto gave half of his tomatoes to his friend. So, the number of tomatoes he gave to his friend is:

\[ \frac{108}{2} = 54 \]

Therefore, the number of tomatoes Haruto has left is:

\[ 108 - 54 = 54 \]

Now we can state the answers:

To determine how many tomatoes Haruto has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of tomatoes grown by the plants.
2. Subtract the number of tomatoes eaten by the birds.
3. Subtract the number of tomatoes Haruto gave to his friend.
4. The result will be the number of tomatoes Haruto has left.

Let's perform the calculations step by step:

1. Total tomatoes grown by the plants: 127
2. Tomatoes eaten by birds: 19
   \[
   127 - 19 = 108
   \]
   So, Haruto picked 108 tomatoes.
3. Tomatoes given to his friend: Half of 108
   \[
   \frac{108}{2} = 54
   \]
   So, Haruto gave 54 tomatoes to his friend.
4. Tomatoes Haruto has left:
   \[
   108 - 54 = 54
   \]

Therefore, Haruto has 54 tomatoes left.

To determine how many tomatoes Haruto has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Subtract the tomatoes eaten by birds from the total.
2. Subtract the tomatoes Haruto gave to his friend from the remaining tomatoes.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Total tomatoes = 127
   Tomatoes eaten by birds = 19
   Remaining tomatoes = 127 - 19 = 108

Now, let's move to the second step:

2. Haruto gave half of his remaining tomatoes to his friend.
   Half of 108 tomatoes = 108 / 2 = 54

So, the number of tomatoes Haruto has left is:

108 - 54 = 54

Therefore, Haruto has 54 tomatoes left.

To find out how many tomatoes Haruto has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of tomatoes after the birds ate some.
2. Calculate how many tomatoes Haruto picked.
3. Determine how many tomatoes Haruto gave to his friend.
4. Calculate the number of tomatoes Haruto has left after giving some to his friend.

Step 1: Total tomatoes after birds ate some.
Total tomatoes = 127
Tomatoes eaten by birds = 19
Tomatoes Haruto picked = 127 - 19 = 108

Step 2: Number of tomatoes Haruto gave to his friend.
Tomatoes given to friend = 108 / 2 = 54

Step 3: Tomatoes left with Haruto.
Tomatoes left = 108 - 54 = 54
