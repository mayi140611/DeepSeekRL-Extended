###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A cheetah can run at a top speed of 60 mph.  The gazelle can run for speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.  If one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially 210 feet apart and they both traveled in the same direction?

system
First, we need to understand that the cheetah and the gazelle are running at 60 mph and 40 mph respectively. Since 1 mile per hour is approximately 1.5 feet per second, we can convert their speeds to feet per second.

For the cheetah:
\[60 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ feet per second per mph} = 90 \text{ feet per second}\]

For the gazelle:
\[40 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ feet per second per mph} = 60 \text{ feet per second}\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for the cheetah to close the 210-foot gap:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{90 \text{ feet per second}} = 2.333 \text{ seconds} \]

The gazelle is running at a speed of 60 feet per second, and the cheetah is closing the gap at a rate of 30 feet per second (90 - 60). Since the cheetah is closing the gap \(2.333 \text{ seconds}\), the gazelle is moving relative to the cheetah at a speed of 60 - 30 = 30 feet per second.

To find the time it takes for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle, we use the relative speed of the gazelle:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{30 \text{ feet per second}} = 7 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the cheetah would take 7 seconds to catch up to the gazelle, given they are traveling in the same direction.

To solve this, we need to find the time it takes for the cheetah to close the 210 feet gap between itself and the gazelle.

1. **Convert initial distance from feet to seconds**:
   Since 1 mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, we first convert the initial distance:
   \[
   \text{Initial distance} = 210 \text{ feet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time to cover the initial distance in seconds} = \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{1.5 \text{ feet/second}} = 140 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the relative speed**:
   The cheetah runs at 60 mph and the gazelle runs at 40 mph. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds:
   \[
   \text{Relative speed} = 60 \text{ mph} - 40 \text{ mph} = 20 \text{ mph}
   \]
   Converting this to feet per second to match the units:
   \[
   \text{Relative speed = } 20 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/second} = 30 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time required to close the gap**:
   Now, we find how long it takes to close the 210 feet gap at the relative speed:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance to cover}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{30 \text{ feet/second}} = 7 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time**:
   The 140 seconds it takes to cover the initial distance plus the 7 seconds to close the gap:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 140 \text{ seconds} + 7 \text{ seconds} = 147 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, the cheetah would catch up to the fleeing gazelle in 147 seconds.

To determine how many seconds it would take for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle, we start by calculating their speeds in feet per second. Since 1 mile per hour is equivalent to 1.5 feet per second, the cheetah's speed is:
\[ 60 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/second per mph} = 90 \text{ feet/second} \]
The gazelle's speed is:
\[ 40 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/second per mph} = 60 \text{ feet/second} \]
The cheetah is 210 feet behind the gazelle initially. To catch up, the cheetah needs to cover this 210-foot gap. The cheetah's speed is 90 feet per second, while the gazelle's is 60 feet per second. Therefore, the cheetah gains on the gazelle at a rate of:
\[ 90 \text{ feet/second} - 60 \text{ feet/second} = 30 \text{ feet/second} \]
To find out how long it takes for the cheetah to close the 210-foot gap, we divide the distance by the rate at which the cheetah closes the gap:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{30 \text{ feet/second}} = 7 \text{ seconds} \]
Thus, it would take the cheetah 7 seconds to catch up to the fleeing gazelle.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative speed of the cheetah compared to the gazelle and then determine how long it would take for the cheetah to close the initial 210-foot gap.

Given:
- Cheetah's top speed: 60 mph
- Gazelle's top speed: 40 mph
- 1 mph = 1.5 feet per second
- Initial gap: 210 feet

First, convert the speeds from miles per hour to feet per second:
- Cheetah's speed in feet per second: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/second per mph} = 90 \text{ feet/second}\)
- Gazelle's speed in feet per second: \(40 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/second per mph} = 60 \text{ feet/second}\)

Next, calculate the relative speed at which the cheetah is gaining on the gazelle:
\[ \text{Relative speed} = 90 \text{ feet/second} - 60 \text{ feet/second} = 30 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, determine how long it would take for the cheetah to cover the initial 210-foot gap at the relative speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Initial gap}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{30 \text{ feet/second}} = 7 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it would take the cheetah 7 seconds to catch up to the gazelle.

To determine how many seconds it would take for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the speeds to feet per second:**
   - A cheetah runs at 60 mph, which is equivalent to \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) feet per second.
   - A gazelle runs at 40 mph, which is equivalent to \(40 \times 1.5 = 60\) feet per second.

2. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - The relative speed of the cheetah with respect to the gazelle is the difference in their speeds, which is \(90 - 60 = 30\) feet per second.

3. **Determine the time it takes for the cheetah to cover the initial 210 feet gap:**
   - The time \(t\) it takes for the cheetah to cover 210 feet at a relative speed of 30 feet per second can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{relative speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{30 \text{ feet/second}} = 7 \text{ seconds}

To determine how long it takes for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle, we need to calculate the relative speed and the time it takes for the cheetah to cover the distance between them.

1. **Convert the speeds from miles per hour to feet per second:**
   - Cheetah speed: 60 mph
   - Gazelle speed: 40 mph
   - Conversion factor: 1 mph = 1.5 feet/second

   Therefore,
   - Cheetah speed in feet/second: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) feet/second
   - Gazelle speed in feet/second: \( 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \) feet/second

2. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   Since both animals are running in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds.
   - Relative speed: \( 90 - 60 = 30 \) feet/second

3. **Convert the initial distance between the two animals from feet to feet:**
   - Initial distance: 210 feet

4. **Determine the time it takes for the cheetah to catch up:**
   Time = Distance / Relative Speed
   - Distance: 210 feet
   - Relative Speed: 30 feet/second

   Therefore,
   - Time = \( \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{30 \text{ feet/second}} = 7 \text{ seconds} \)

To solve this problem, we'll first convert the speeds of the cheetah and the gazelle from miles per hour to feet per second, and then calculate the relative speed difference between them. We'll also consider the distance between them before the cheetah catches up.

1. Convert the speeds from miles per hour to feet per second:
   - Cheetah speed = 60 mph = 60 * 1.5 ≈ 90 feet per second
   - Gazelle speed = 40 mph = 40 * 1.5 ≈ 60 feet per second

2. Calculate the relative speed difference:
   - Relative speed = Cheetah speed - Gazelle speed
   - Relative speed = 90 - 60 = 30 feet per second

3. Calculate the time it takes for the cheetah to close the 210-foot gap:
   - Time = Distance / Relative speed = 210 / 30 = 7 seconds

4. Calculate the distance the cheetah will cover in 7 seconds at its top speed:
   - Distance covered by cheetah in 7 seconds = Cheetah speed * Time
   - Distance covered by cheetah in 7 seconds = 90 * 7 = 630 feet

The answer is 630.

To determine how many seconds it takes for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle, we need to calculate the relative speed of the cheetah with respect to the gazelle and then use that to find the time it takes for the cheetah to close the initial 210-foot gap.

First, we calculate the relative speed:
Relative speed = Cheetah's speed - Gazelle's speed
Relative speed = 60 mph - 40 mph = 20 mph

To convert the relative speed from miles per hour to feet per second, we use the conversion factor 1 mile per hour = 1.5 feet per second:
Relative speed (feet per second) = 20 mph * 1.5 feet per second per mph = 30 feet per second

Next, we calculate the time it takes for the cheetah to cover the initial 210-foot gap at the relative speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 feet / 30 feet per second = 7 seconds

Therefore, it takes the cheetah 7 seconds to catch up to the gazelle if they both are traveling in the same direction.

First, let's calculate the speeds of the cheetah and the gazelle in feet per second. Since 1 mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, we can convert their speeds as follows:

Cheetah speed in feet per second = 60 mph * 1.5 ft/sec/mph = 90 ft/sec
Gazelle speed in feet per second = 40 mph * 1.5 ft/sec/mph = 60 ft/sec

Now, let's calculate the relative speed at which the cheetah is running faster than the gazelle. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds:

Relative speed = 90 ft/sec - 60 ft/sec = 30 ft/sec

The distance between the cheetah and the gazelle initially is 210 feet. Since the cheetah is running at 90 ft/sec relative to the gazelle, we can calculate the time it takes for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle:

Time to catch up = Distance / Relative speed
Time to catch up = 210 ft / 30 ft/sec = 7 seconds

To determine how long it would take for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle, we first need to calculate the head start distance of the gazelle in terms of time.

Since one mile per hour is approximately 1.5 feet per second, and the initial distance between the cheetah and the gazelle is 210 feet, we can find the time it takes for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle using the following steps:

1. Calculate the head start time the gazelle has in seconds. The head start distance is 210 feet, and since the gazelle runs at 40 mph, the time taken to cover this distance is \( \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{40 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/second}} \).

\[ \text{Head start time} = \frac{210}{40 \times 1.5} \text{ seconds} \]

2. Once the cheetah catches up to the gazelle, both animals will be running at the same speed. Since they are running for the same time, the time taken to catch up is the same as the time taken for the gazelle to cover the initial 210 feet at the same speed.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{40 \text{ mph}} \]

Let's calculate both times.

\[ \text{Head start time} = \frac{210}{60} = 3.5 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Time to catch up at the same speed} = \frac{210}{40} = 5.25 \text{ seconds} \]

Since the time taken for the cheetah to catch up is the same as the time the gazelle needs to cover the 210 feet at its top speed, it would be:

\[ \text{Time to catch up} = \frac{210 \text{ feet}}{40 \text{ mph}} = 5.25 \text{ seconds} \]
