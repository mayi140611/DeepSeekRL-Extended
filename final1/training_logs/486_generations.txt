72
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Jonah bought 6 pineapples at $3 each, so the total cost is 6 * $3 = $18.

Each pineapple can be cut into 12 pineapple rings, so the total number of rings is 6 * 12 = 72 rings.

Jonah sold 4 rings for $5 each, so the total revenue from selling rings is 72 / 4 * $5 = $90.

The profit Jonah made is the total revenue from selling rings minus the total cost, which is $90 - $18 = $72.

To calculate Jonah's profit, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the pineapple:**
   - Jonah bought 6 pineapples at $3 each.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the pineapple rings:**
   - Each pineapple can be cut into 12 pineapple rings.
   - Jonah sold 4 rings for $5 each.
   \[
   \text{Total rings sold} = 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ rings}
   \]
   - Since 72 rings were sold and you sold 4 rings for $5, we need to do:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue for 4 rings} = \text{Total revenue} = \frac{5}{4}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue for all rings} = 72 \times \frac{5}{4} = 72 \times 1.25 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 90 - 18 = 72 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Let's begin by calculating the total cost of the pineapples. 
Total cost for pineapples: 6 pineapples * $3 each = $18

Next, we'll determine how much Jonah earned from selling the pineapple rings. 
Total rings from 6 pineapples: 6 pineapples * 12 rings each = 72 rings
Price per 4 rings: $5

Now, we calculate how many sets of 4 rings Jonah sold. 
Number of 4-rings sets: 72 rings / 4 rings per set = 18 sets

Finally, we calculate Jonah's total earnings by multiplying the number of sets by the price per set: 
Total earnings: 18 sets * $5 per set = $90

To calculate Jonah's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings: 
Profit: Total earnings - Total cost = $90 - $18 = $72

Therefore, Jonah made a profit of $72.

To find the profit Jonah made, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost, and then subtract the cost from the revenue.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Total cost of pineapples**:
   Jonah bought 6 pineapples at $3 each.
   \[
   6 \text{ pineapples} \times \$3 \text{ per pineapple} = \$18
   \]

2. **Total revenue from selling pineapple rings**:
   Jonah sold 4 rings from each pineapple, and each ring was sold for $5.
   Since each pineapple has 12 rings, Jonah sold 12 rings per pineapple.
   He sold 4 rings for $5, so for 12 rings (which is a full set of four), the revenue is:
   \[
   12 \text{ rings} \times \$5 \text{ per ring} = \$60
   \]

3. **Profit calculation**:
   Subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$60 - \$18 = \$42
   \]

Thus, Jonah made a profit of $42.

To determine Jonah's profit, we need to first calculate his total revenue from selling the pineapple rings and then subtract his total cost.

Jonah bought 6 pineapples at $3 each, so the total cost is:
6 pineapples * $3/pineapple = $18

Each pineapple can be cut into 12 rings, so the total number of rings is:
6 pineapples * 12 rings/pineapple = 72 rings

Jonah sold each ring for $5, so his total revenue is:
72 rings * $5/ring = $360

Now, to find the total profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$360 - $18 = $342

So, Jonah made a profit of $342.

To calculate the profit Jonah made, we need to determine the total cost of the pineapples, the total revenue from selling pineapple rings, and then subtract the cost from the revenue.

Total cost of pineapples = Number of pineapples per unit × Price per unit
= 6 pineapples × $3 per pineapple
= $18

Total revenue from selling pineapple rings = Number of pineapple rings per unit × Price per unit
= 4 pineapple rings × $5 per pineapple ring
= $20

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $20 - $18
= $2

Therefore, Jonah made a profit of $2.

To calculate Jonah's profit, we need to first determine his total revenue and then subtract his total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue.
Jonah sold 4 pineapple rings for $5 each, so he sold a total of 4 * 4 = 16 pineapple rings.
His total revenue is 16 rings * $5/ring = $80.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
Jonah bought 6 pineapples at $3 each, so his total cost is 6 * $3 = $18.

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit is calculated as Revenue - Cost.
Profit = $80 - $18 = $62.

Therefore, Jonah made a profit of $62.

To calculate the profit Jonah made, we need to first calculate his total revenue and then subtract his total costs.

Jonah bought 6 pineapples, each costing $3. Therefore, his total cost for pineapples is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6 \times \$3 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling the pineapple rings:
- Each pineapple can be cut into 12 rings, so Jonah could sell \( 6 \times 12 = 72 \) rings.
- He sold 4 rings for $5, so he can sell 18 sets of 4 rings (since \( \frac{72}{4} = 18 \)).
- Therefore, his total revenue is:
  \[ \text{Total revenue} = 18 \times \$5 \]

Finally, the profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} \]

So, let's calculate the total cost and total revenue:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 6 \times \$3 = \$18 \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 18 \times \$5 = \$90 \]

Now, we can calculate the total profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$90 - \$18 = \$72 \]

Therefore, Jonah made a profit of $72.

First, calculate the total cost of the pineapples. Jonah bought 6 pineapples at $3 each, so the cost is \(6 \times 3 = \$18\).

Next, calculate the total number of pineapple rings he made. Each pineapple can be cut into 12 rings, so for 6 pineapples, he has \(6 \times 12 = 72\) rings.

Jonah sells 4 rings for $5. To find out how much he sells 72 rings for, first find out how many $5 units are in 72 rings. This is \(72 \div 4 = 18\) sets of $5.

So, the total revenue from selling 72 rings is \(18 \times 5 = \$90\).

Finally, the profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is \(90 - 18 = \$72\).

First, calculate the total cost of the pineapples:
6 pineapples * $3 each = $18

Next, calculate the total number of pineapple rings:
6 pineapples * 12 rings each = 72 rings

Then, determine the total revenue from selling the rings. We know that Jonah sold 4 rings for $5 each:

Total revenue from selling rings = (Total number of rings / 4 rings per sale) * $5
Total revenue from selling rings = (72 rings / 4 rings per sale) * $5
Total revenue from selling rings = 18 * $5
Total revenue from selling rings = $90

Now, to find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue from selling rings - Total cost
Profit = $90 - $18
