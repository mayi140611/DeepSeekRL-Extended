Harry's speed on Monday was 10 meters per hour.

From Tuesday to Thursday, he ran 50% faster than on Monday. To find out how much faster that is, we calculate 50% of 10 meters per hour which is 5 meters per hour. 
Adding that to his Monday speed, his running speed during this period would be:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ meters per hour} \]

On Friday, he ran 60% faster than he did on Thursday. To calculate this, we first find 60% of Thursday's speed:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \text{ meters per hour} \]

Adding this to Thursday's speed:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \text{ meters per hour} \]

So, Harry's speed on Friday was 24 meters per hour.

To determine how fast Harry ran on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Harry's speed on Tuesday by adding 50% to his Monday speed.
2. Calculate Harry's speed on Wednesday by adding 50% to his Tuesday speed.
3. Calculate Harry's speed on Thursday by adding 50% to his Wednesday speed.
4. Calculate Harry's speed on Friday by adding 60% to his Thursday speed.

Let's start with Monday's speed:
- Monday: 10 meters per hour

Now, let's calculate Tuesday's speed:
- Tuesday: 10 meters/hour + (50% of 10 meters/hour) = 10 meters/hour + 5 meters/hour = 15 meters/hour

Now, let's calculate Wednesday's speed:
- Wednesday: 15 meters/hour + (50% of 15 meters/hour) = 15 meters/hour + 7.5 meters/hour = 22.5 meters/hour

Now, let's calculate Thursday's speed:
- Thursday: 22.5 meters/hour + (50% of 22.5 meters/hour) = 22.5 meters/hour + 11.25 meters/hour = 33.75 meters/hour

Now, let's calculate Friday's speed:
- Friday: 33.75 meters/hour + (60% of 33.75 meters/hour) = 33.75 meters/hour + 20.25 meters/hour = 54 meters/hour

Therefore, Harry ran 54 meters per hour on Friday.

To determine how fast Harry ran on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Harry's speed from Tuesday to Thursday:
   - Speed on Monday: 10 meters per hour
   - Speed from Tuesday to Thursday: 50% faster than Monday
     Speed = 10 meters/hour + (0.50 * 10 meters/hour)
     Speed = 10 meters/hour + 5 meters/hour
     Speed = 15 meters/hour

2. Calculate Harry's speed on Friday:
   - Speed on Thursday: 15 meters/hour
   - Speed on Friday: 60% faster than Thursday
     Speed = 15 meters/hour + (0.60 * 15 meters/hour)
     Speed = 15 meters/hour + 9 meters/hour
     Speed = 24 meters/hour

Therefore, Harry ran at 24 meters per hour on Friday.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Harry's running speed on each day and then find his speed on Friday.

1. Harry's speed on Monday is given as 10 meters per hour.
2. From Tuesday to Thursday, his speed increased by 50% compared to Monday. Hence, his speed on Tuesday is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) meters per hour, on Wednesday \(15 \times 1.5 = 22.5\) meters per hour, and on Thursday \(22.5 \times 1.5 = 33.75\) meters per hour.
3. On Friday, his speed increased by 60% compared to Thursday. Therefore, his speed on Friday is \(33.75 \times 1.6 = 54\) meters per hour, because 60% is equivalent to 1.6 in decimal form.

Thus, Harry ran 54 meters per hour on Friday.

We start by determining Harry's speed on Monday, which is given as 10 meters per hour.

Next, we calculate Harry's speed from Tuesday to Thursday. Since he ran 50% faster than on Monday, we calculate this as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ meters/hour} \times (1 + 0.5) = 10 \text{ meters/hour} \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ meters/hour} \]

Then, we determine his speed on Friday, which is 60% faster than his speed on Thursday. So we calculate this as follows:
\[ 15 \text{ meters/hour} \times (1 + 0.6) = 15 \text{ meters/hour} \times 1.6 = 24 \text{ meters/hour} \]

Therefore, Harry ran at a speed of 24 meters per hour on Friday.

2. Use that speed to find the speed on Friday.

On Monday, Harry ran at 10 meters per hour. From Tuesday to Thursday, he ran 50% faster than on Monday. The speed on Tuesday to Thursday is:
\[ \text{Speed on Tuesday to Thursday} = 10 \text{ meters per hour} + 0.5 \times 10 \text{ meters per hour} = 10 \text{ meters per hour} + 5 \text{ meters per hour} = 15 \text{ meters per hour} \]

On Friday, he ran 60% faster than he did on Thursday. Therefore, the speed on Friday is:
\[ \text{Speed on Friday} = 15 \text{ meters per hour} + 0.6 \times 15 \text{ meters per hour} = 15 \text{ meters per hour} + 9 \text{ meters per hour} = 24 \text{ meters per hour} \]

To determine Harry's running speed on Friday, we need to calculate his speed each day and then apply the provided percentage increases.

1. **Speed on Monday:** Harry runs at 10 meters per hour.
2. **Speed from Tuesday to Thursday:** Harry runs 50% faster than on Monday. To find 50% of 10 meters per hour, we calculate:
   \[
   0.50 \times 10 = 5 \text{ meters per hour}
   \]
   Adding this to Monday's speed:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15 \text{ meters per hour}
   \]
   So, from Tuesday to Thursday, Harry runs at 15 meters per hour.

3. **Speed on Friday:** Harry runs 60% faster than he did on Thursday. First, we calculate what 160% of Thursday's speed is:
   \[
   1.60 \times 15 = 24 \text{ meters per hour}
   \]
   Therefore, on Friday, Harry runs at 24 meters per hour.

Thus, Harry's speed on Friday is 24 meters per hour.

To determine how fast Harry ran on Friday, we'll calculate his running speed step by step.

First, we know that Harry ran at a speed of 10 meters per hour on Monday.

From Tuesday to Thursday, his speed increased by 50% compared to his Monday speed. This means his speed on these three days was:

\[ \text{Speed on Tuesday to Thursday} = 10 \, \text{meters per hour} + 0.5 \times 10 \, \text{meters per hour} = 10 \, \text{meters per hour} + 5 \, \text{meters per hour} = 15 \, \text{meters per hour} \]

Next, on Friday, his speed was 60% faster than on Thursday. This means his speed on Friday was:

\[ \text{Speed on Friday} = 15 \, \text{meters per hour} + 0.6 \times 15 \, \text{meters per hour} = 15 \, \text{meters per hour} + 9 \, \text{meters per hour} = 24 \, \text{meters per hour} \]

To find out how fast Harry ran on Friday, we need to calculate his speed step by step:

1. On Monday, Harry ran at 10 meters per hour.
2. From Tuesday to Thursday, he ran 50% faster than on Monday. So we calculate the speed by increasing Monday's speed by 50%:
   \[
   10 \text{ meters/hour} + (10 \text{ meters/hour} \times 0.50) = 10 \text{ meters/hour} + 5 \text{ meters/hour} = 15 \text{ meters/hour}
   \]
3. On Friday, he ran 60% faster than he did on Thursday. Since Thursday's speed is the same as Tuesday to Thursday's speed (15 meters per hour), Friday's speed is calculated by increasing Thursday's speed by 60%:
   \[
   15 \text{ meters/hour} + (15 \text{ meters/hour} \times 0.60) = 15 \text{ meters/hour} + 9 \text{ meters/hour} = 24 \text{ meters/hour}

   \]

2. From Tuesday to Thursday, Harry ran 50% faster than he did on Monday. A 50% increase in speed means he ran at 150% of the Monday speed. We calculate 150% of the Monday speed:
   \[
   1.5 \times 10 = 15 \text{ meters/hour}
   \]

3. Now, on Friday, Harry ran 60% faster than he did on Thursday. A 60% increase in speed means he ran at 160% of the Thursday speed. We calculate 160% of the Thursday speed:
