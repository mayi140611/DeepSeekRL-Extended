To determine the total minutes Jeff ran during the week, we need to calculate his runs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Jeff runs for an hour, which is 60 minutes each day.
   - Total for these three days: \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

2. **Thursday:**
   - Jeff runs for 60 minutes but cuts short by 20 minutes.
   - Effective run time: \(60 - 20 = 40\) minutes.

3. **Friday:**
   - Jeff runs for 60 minutes but adds 10 minutes more.
   - Effective run time: \(60 + 10 = 70\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the minutes for all days:
- Total for the week: \(180 + 40 + 70 = 310\) minutes.

Therefore, Jeff ran for a total of 310 minutes that week.

Jeff runs for an hour each day during the weekdays, which means he runs for 6 hours in total during the weekdays. On Thursday, he ran for 60 - 20 = 40 minutes less than his usual hour, so he ran for 60 - 20 = 40 minutes. On Friday, he ran for 60 + 10 = 70 minutes. The total time he ran during the weekdays is therefore 6 * 60 - 20 + 70 = 390 minutes.

Jeff committed to run for an hour a day during weekdays. An hour is equal to 60 minutes.

On Thursday, he cut short his run by 20 minutes, so he ran for a total of 60 - 20 = 40 minutes.

On Friday, he was able to jog 10 minutes more than the normal 60 minutes, so he ran for a total of 60 + 10 = 70 minutes.

To find the total minutes Jeff ran that week, we add the minutes for each day: 40 + 60 + 70 = 170 minutes.

Therefore, Jeff ran a total of 170 minutes that week.

Jeff's original daily run duration is 60 minutes (1 hour). On Thursday, he cut short his run by 20 minutes, so he ran \(60 - 20 = 40\) minutes on Thursday. On Friday, he jogged 10 minutes more than his usual 60 minutes, so he ran \(60 + 10 = 70\) minutes on Friday.

To find out the total number of minutes he ran for the entire week, we sum up the minutes for each day: \(40 + 0 + 60 + 70 + 80 = 250\).

Therefore, Jeff was able to run for 250 minutes that week.

To find out how many minutes Jeff ran in the week, we need to calculate his running times for each day separately and then sum them up.

First, Jeff committed to run for an hour on a normal day (Monday through Wednesday). Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he runs for \(60\) minutes on each weekday. Therefore, for three weekdays, the total running time is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

On Thursday, Jeff cut his run by 20 minutes. So, his running time on Thursday is \(60 - 20 = 40\) minutes.

On Friday, he was able to jog 10 minutes more than the regular running time. Therefore, his running time on Friday is \(60 + 10 = 70\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the running times for all the days of the week:

\[180 \text{ (Monday)} + 60 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 40 \text{ (Thursday)} + 70 \text{ (Friday)} = 350 \text{ minutes}\]

So, Jeff was able to run for a total of \(350\) minutes that week.

Jeff ran for an hour (60 minutes) a day from Monday to Wednesday. On Thursday, he cut his run short by 20 minutes, so he ran for \(60 - 20 = 40\) minutes. On Friday, he jogged 10 minutes more than on Thursday, so he ran for \(40 + 10 = 50\) minutes. 

To find the total minutes Jeff ran for the week, we sum the minutes from Monday to Friday:
\[
(60 + 60 + 60 + 40 + 50) = 270

Therefore, Jeff ran for 270 minutes that week.

Let's calculate the total number of minutes Jeff ran each day for the week.

- Monday to Wednesday he ran for an hour each day, which is 60 minutes each day.
- On Thursday, he cut his run short by 20 minutes, so he ran for 60 - 20 = 40 minutes.
- On Friday, he jogged 10 minutes more than he ran on Thursday, so he ran for 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

Now, let's sum up the total minutes he ran:

- Monday: 60 minutes
- Tuesday: 60 minutes

Jeff ran for an hour on each weekday, which is 60 minutes each day. 

From Monday to Wednesday, he ran for \(60 \times 3 = 180\) minutes.
On Thursday, he cut his run short by 20 minutes, so he ran for \(60 - 20 = 40\) minutes.
On Friday, he jogged 10 more minutes than he originally planned, so he ran for \(60 + 10 = 70\) minutes.

Thus, for the week, he ran for \(180 + 40 + 70 = 290\) minutes.

The total minutes he ran for the week is 290.

To determine the total number of minutes Jeff ran that week, we need to break down his activities for each day:

- On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, Jeff ran for the full hour (60 minutes).
- On Thursday, he cut his run short by 20 minutes, so he only ran for 40 minutes.
- On Friday, he jogged 10 minutes more than he originally planned, so he ran for 60 + 10 = 70 minutes.

Now we can sum up the minutes for each day:
- Monday: 60 minutes
- Tuesday: 60 minutes
- Wednesday: 60 minutes
- Thursday: 40 minutes
- Friday: 70 minutes

Total minutes: 60 + 60 + 60 + 40 + 70 = 290 minutes

Let's calculate Jeff's total running minutes for the week.

1. **Calculate for the first three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday):**
   - Jeff ran for 60 minutes each day.
   - Total for these three days: \( 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate for Thursday:**
   - Jeff cut his run short by 20 minutes.
   - Total running minutes on Thursday: \( 60 \text{ minutes} - 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate for Friday:**
   - Jeff ran 10 minutes more than normal.
   - Total running minutes on Friday: \( 60 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Calculate the total for the week:**
   - Add the minutes from all days: \( 180 \text{ minutes (first three days)} + 40 \text{ minutes (Thursday)} + 70 \text{ minutes (Friday)} = 290 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Jeff was able to run for 290 minutes that week.

To determine the total minutes Jeff ran in the week, we need to calculate the running time for each day of the week.

1. **Monday to Wednesday:**
   - He runs for 2 hours a day.
   - Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
   - Total running time for these three days: 120 minutes.

2. **Thursday:**
   - He runs for 2 hours but cuts short his run by 20 minutes.
   - The new running time is 2 hours - 20 minutes = 120 minutes - 20 minutes = 100 minutes.

3. **Friday:**
   - He runs for 2 hours and 10 minutes more than usual.
   - The usual running time is 2 hours = 120 minutes.
   - He runs 10 minutes more, so the new running time is 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes.

Now, we sum up the running times for all the days.
- Monday to Wednesday: 120 minutes
- Thursday: 100 minutes
- Friday: 130 minutes

Total minutes run in the week: 120 + 100 + 130 = 350 minutes.

Jeff ran for an hour on weekdays, which totals to 5 hours a week (5 days * 60 minutes = 300 minutes). On Thursday, he cut his run short by 20 minutes, so he ran for 50 minutes on Thursday (300 - 20 = 280 minutes). On Friday, he jogged 10 minutes more than his usual run, so he ran for 51 minutes on Friday (300 + 10 = 310 minutes). To find the total for the week, we add the minutes from each day: 280 (Thursday) + 300 (Friday) + 310 (Thursday) = 890 minutes.

To determine how many minutes Jeff was able to run for the week, we need to break down the information given:

1. On average, Jeff committed to run for an hour (60 minutes) a day during weekdays.
2. On Thursday, he cut his run short by 20 minutes. So, he ran for \(60 - 20 = 40\) minutes.
3. On Friday, he was able to jog 10 minutes more than the average, which means he ran for \(60 + 10 = 70\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total minutes for the week:
- From Monday to Wednesday: \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes
- On Thursday: 40 minutes
- On Friday: 70 minutes

Adding these up, the total minutes Jeff ran for the week is \(180 + 40 + 70 = 290\) minutes.
