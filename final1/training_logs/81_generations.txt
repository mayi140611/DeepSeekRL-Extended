###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Sam and Jeff had a skipping competition at recess. The competition was split into four rounds. Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. If Sam skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff?

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we first need to determine the number of skips he completed in each round.

1. **First Round:**
   Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff.
   Since Sam completed 16 skips,
   Jeff completed \(16 - 1 = 15\) skips.

2. **Second Round:**
   Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam.
   Since Sam completed 16 skips,
   Jeff completed \(16 - 3 = 13\) skips.

3. **Third Round:**
   Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam.
   Since Sam completed 16 skips,
   Jeff completed \(16 + 4 = 20\) skips.

4. **Fourth Round:**
   Jeff skipped half the number of skips as Sam.
   Since Sam completed 16 skips,
   Jeff completed \(16 / 2 = 8\) skips.

Now, we add up the total number of skips Jeff completed in all four rounds:
\[ 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56 \]

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we divide the total by the number of rounds:
\[ \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

Therefore, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 14.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of skips Jeff made in each round as \( J_1, J_2, J_3, \) and \( J_4 \) for the first, second, third, and fourth rounds respectively.

From the problem statement:
- In the first round, Sam skipped 1 more times than Jeff: \( J_1 = S_1 + 1 \).
- In the second round, Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam: \( J_2 = S_2 - 3 \).
- In the third round, Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam: \( J_3 = S_3 + 4 \).
- In the fourth round, Jeff skipped half the number of Sam's skips: \( J_4 = \frac{S_4}{2} \).

Given Sam skipped 16 times in each round, we have:
- \( S_1 = 16 \)
- \( S_2 = 16 \)
- \( S_3 = 16 \)
- \( S_4 = 16 \)

Now, we can find the number of skips Jeff made in each round.

1. For the first round:
\[ J_1 = S_1 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \]

2. For the second round:
\[ J_2 = S_2 - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

3. For the third round:
\[ J_3 = S_3 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20 \]

4. For the fourth round:
\[ J_4 = \frac{S_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Now, we have:
- \( J_1 = 17 \)
- \( J_2 = 13 \)
- \( J_3 = 20 \)
- \( J_4 = 8 \)

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we calculate:
\[ \text{Average skips} = \frac{J_1 + J_2 + J_3 + J_4}{4} \]

<answer>
\[ \text{Average skips} = \frac{17 + 13 + 20 + 8}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average skips} = \frac{58}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average skips} = 14.5 \]

Therefore, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 14.5.

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we first need to calculate how many times he skipped in each round.

1. Sam's total skips in each round: 16
2. According to the problem, Sam skipped 1 more than Jeff in the first round, so Jeff skipped 16 - 1 = 15 skips in the first round.
3. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round, so Jeff skipped 16 - 3 = 13 skips in the second round.
4. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round, so Jeff skipped 16 + 4 = 20 skips in the third round.
5. Jeff skipped half the number of skips as Sam in the last round, so Jeff skipped 16 / 2 = 8 skips in the last round.

Now, we calculate the total number of skips Jeff completed:
15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56 skips

Since there are 4 rounds, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is:
56 skips / 4 rounds = 14 skips per round

So, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 14.

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we need to calculate the number of skips Sam and Jeff made in each round and then find the average for Jeff.

1. **First Round**: Sam skipped 16 times. Jeff skipped 1 fewer time than Sam.
   - Jeff's skips in the first round = 16 - 1 = 15.

2. **Second Round**: Sam skipped 16 times. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam.
   - Jeff's skips in the second round = 16 - 3 = 13.

3. **Third Round**: Sam skipped 16 times. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam.
   - Jeff's skips in the third round = 16 + 4 = 20.

4. **Fourth Round**: Sam skipped 16 times. Jeff skipped half the number of skips as Sam.
   - Jeff's skips in the fourth round = 16 / 2 = 8.

Now, we sum up Jeff's skips over all four rounds:
\[ 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56 \]

Since there are four rounds, we calculate the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff:
\[ \text{Average skips per round} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

Thus, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 14.

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we need to first establish the number of skips Jeff completed in each round.

1. **First Round**: 
   - Sam completed 16 skips.
   - Jeff completed 1 fewer skip than Sam.
   - Therefore, Jeff completed \( 16 - 1 = 15 \) skips.

2. **Second Round**:
   - Sam completed 16 skips.
   - Jeff completed 3 fewer skips than Sam.
   - Therefore, Jeff completed \( 16 - 3 = 13 \) skips.

   - Jeff completed 4 more skips than Sam.
   - Therefore, Jeff completed \( 16 + 4 = 20 \) skips.

4. **Fourth Round**:
   - Sam completed 16 skips.
   - Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam.
   - Therefore, Jeff completed \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) skips.

Now, we calculate the total number of skips completed by Jeff over all four rounds:
   - Jeff's total skips = \( 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56 \)

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we divide the total by the number of rounds:
   - Average = \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \)

Therefore, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 14.

The first round Jeff completed 1 fewer skip than Sam who completed 16 skips, therefore, Jeff skipped 15 times in the first round. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round, meaning that Jeff attempted 13 times in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round, meaning Jeff attempted 18 times in the third round. Jeff skipped 1/2 times as many skips as Sam in the forth round, meaning Jeff attempted 8 times in the forth round. The average number of skips Jeff completed in the four rounds is 8 + 15 + 13 + 18 = 54. The answer is 13.5.

Let's denote the number of skips Sam made in each round as \( S_{\text{round}} \) and the number of skips Jeff made in each round as \( J_{\text{round}} \).

Given:
- Sam skipped 16 times in each round, so \( S_{\text{round}} = 16 \).
- In the first round, Sam skipped 1 more skip than Jeff, so \( S_{\text{round}} = J_{\text{round}} + 1 \).
- In the second round, Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam, so \( J_{\text{round}} = S_{\text{round}} - 3 \).
- In the third round, Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam, so \( J_{\text{round}} = S_{\text{round}} + 4 \).
- In the last round, Jeff skipped half the number of skips as Sam, so \( J_{\text{round}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot S_{\text{round}} \).

First, let's find \( J_{\text{round}} \) for each round using the given information:

For the first round, Sam skipped 16 times:
\[ J_{\text{round}} = S_{\text{round}} - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15. \]

For the second round, Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam:
\[ J_{\text{round}} = S_{\text{round}} - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13. \]

For the third round, Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam:
\[ J_{\text{round}} = S_{\text{round}} + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20. \]

For the last round, Jeff skipped half the number of skips as Sam:
\[ J_{\text{round}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot S_{\text{round}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16 = 8. \]

Now, let's list the number of skips Jeff completed in each round:
- First round: 15 skips
- Second round: 13 skips
- Third round: 20 skips
- Last round: 8 skips

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we add up the number of skips he completed in each round and then divide by the number of rounds (4):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{15 + 13 + 20 + 8}{4} = \frac{56}{4} = 14. \]

Therefore, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 14 skips per round.

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we'll first calculate how many times Jeff skipped in each round based on the information provided.

1. **First Round**: Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff, so Jeff completed:
   \[
   16 - 1 = 15 \text{ times}
   \]

2. **Second Round**: Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam, so Jeff completed:
   \[
   16 - 3 = 13 \text{ times}
   \]

3. **Third Round**: Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam, so Jeff completed:
   \[
   16 + 4 = 20 \text{ times}
   \]

4. **Fourth Round**: Jeff only completed half the number of skips as Sam, so Jeff completed:
   \[
   \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of skips completed by Jeff in all four rounds to get the total number of skips:
\[
15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56
\]

Since Jeff's total for all rounds is 56 and there are 4 rounds, we find the average number of skips per round by dividing the total by the number of rounds:
\[
\frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

So the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is **14**.

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we need to calculate the number of skips Jeff completed in each round and then find the average of those numbers.

1. **First Round:**
   - Sam completed 16 skips.
   - Jeff completed 1 more skip than Sam in the first round.
   - Therefore, Jeff's skips in the first round = Sam's skips + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 skips.

2. **Second Round:**
   - Sam skipped 16 times.
   - Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round.
   - Therefore, Jeff's skips in the second round = Sam's skips - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 skips.

3. **Third Round:**
   - Sam skipped 16 times.
   - Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round.
   - Therefore, Jeff's skips in the third round = Sam's skips + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20 skips.

4. **Fourth Round:**
   - Sam skipped 16 times.
   - Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam in the fourth round.
   - Therefore, Jeff's skips in the fourth round = Sam's skips / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 skips.

Now, let's calculate the total number of skips Jeff completed in all four rounds and find the average:

- Total skips by Jeff = 17 (first round) + 13 (second round) + 20 (third round) + 8 (fourth round) = 58 skips.
- Number of rounds = 4.
- Average skips per round by Jeff = Total skips by Jeff / Number of rounds = 58 / 4 = 14.5 skips.

**Average number of skips per round completed by Jeff: 14.5 skips.**

We can start by defining Sam's skips in each round. Sam skips 16 times in each round of the competition.

In the first round, Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam. Therefore, Jeff skipped 16 - 3 = 13 times in the first round.

In the second round, Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam. Therefore, Jeff skipped 16 + 4 = 20 times in the second round.

In the third round, Jeff skipped half the number of skips as Sam. Therefore, Jeff skipped \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) times in the third round.

In the last round, Jeff skipped half the number of skips as Sam. Therefore, Jeff skipped \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) times in the last round.

Next, we calculate the total number of skips Jeff completed across all four rounds:
- First round: 13 skips
- Second round: 20 skips
- Third round: 8 skips
- Last round: 8 skips

Total skips Jeff completed: \( 13 + 20 + 8 + 8 = 49 \) skips.

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we need to divide the total number of skips by the number of rounds:
\[ \text{Average skips per round} = \frac{49 \text{ skips}}{4 \text{ rounds}} = 12.25 \]

Therefore, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 12.25.
