#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Bert's earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of toy phones sold by the price per phone. Thus, Bert's earnings = 8 toy phones * $18/toy phone = $144.

Similarly, Tory's earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of toy guns sold by the price per gun. Therefore, Tory's earnings = 7 toy guns * $20/toy gun = $140.

Now, to find out how much more Bert earned than Tory, we subtract Tory's earnings from Bert's earnings. This means Bert's earnings - Tory's earnings = $144 - $140 = $4.

Therefore, Bert earned $4 more than Tory.

To find out how much more Bert earned than Tory, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then compare them.

Bert's earnings = Number of phones sold * Price per phone
Bert's earnings = 8 phones * $18/phone
Bert's earnings = $144

Tory's earnings = Number of guns sold * Price per gun
Tory's earnings = 7 guns * $20/gun
Tory's earnings = $140

Now, the difference in earnings between Bert and Tory is:

Difference = Bert's earnings - Tory's earnings
Difference = $144 - $140
Difference = $4

Therefore, Bert earned $4 more than Tory.

To calculate how much more Bert earned than Tory, we'll first calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference between them.

Bert's earnings are calculated by multiplying his number of toy phones sold by the price per phone:
\[ \text{Bert's earnings} = 8 \times $18 = $144 \]

Tory's earnings are calculated in a similar manner:
\[ \text{Tory's earnings} = 7 \times $20 = $140 \]

Now, to find out how much more Bert earned than Tory:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Bert's earnings} - \text{Tory's earnings} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = $144 - $140 = $4 \]

So, Bert earned $4 more than Tory.

To solve this, first determine how much Bert earned by calculating the total sales of his toy phones.
Bert's earnings from toy phones = 8 * $18 = $144

Next, calculate how much Tory earned by multiplying the number of toy guns sold by the price per gun.
Tory's earnings from toy guns = 7 * $20 = $140

Now, to find out how much more Bert earned than Tory, subtract Tory's earnings from Bert's earnings.
Difference in earnings between Bert and Tory = Bert's earnings - Tory's earnings
= $144 - $140
= $4

Therefore, Bert earned $4 more than Tory.
