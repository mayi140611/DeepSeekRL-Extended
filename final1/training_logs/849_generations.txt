###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Eugene built a model house out of toothpicks and a deck of playing cards.  For every card, he used 75 toothpicks.  The deck of playing cards had 52 cards, and Eugene used all but 16 of the cards to build his house.  If a box of toothpicks contains 450 toothpicks, how many boxes of toothpicks did Eugene use to create his model house?

<reasoning>
Eugene used 52 cards in total, but he used only 52 - 16 = 36 cards. Since he uses 75 toothpicks for each card, he used 36 * 75 = 2700 toothpicks.
A box of toothpicks contains 450 toothpicks, so the number of boxes Eugene used is 2700 / 450 = 6 boxes.

Therefore, Eugene used 6 boxes of toothpicks to create his model house.

Eugene used 52 - 16 = 36 cards to build his house.
Since each card requires 75 toothpicks, Eugene used 36 * 75 = 2700 toothpicks.

We know that a box of toothpicks contains 450 toothpicks.

To find out how many boxes Eugene used, divide the total number of toothpicks by the number of toothpicks in a box:
2700 toothpicks / 450 toothpicks per box = 6 boxes.

Therefore, Eugene used 6 boxes of toothpicks to create his model house.

First, we need to determine how many cards Eugene used to build his house. Since the deck had 52 cards and he used all but 16, we subtract 16 from 52:

$$
52 - 16 = 36 \text{ cards}
$$

Next, we know that for every card, Eugene used 75 toothpicks. Therefore, to find out how many toothpicks he used in total, we multiply the number of cards by the number of toothpicks per card:

$$
36 \text{ cards} \times 75 \text{ toothpicks per card} = 2700 \text{ toothpicks}
$$

Since each box contains 450 toothpicks, we can determine the number of boxes Eugene used by dividing the total number of toothpicks by the number of toothpicks per box:

$$
\frac{2700 \text{ toothpicks}}{450 \text{ toothpicks per box}} = 6 \text{ boxes}
$$

Therefore, Eugene used 6 boxes of toothpicks to create his model house.

First, we need to determine how many cards Eugene used to build his model house. We know the deck had 52 cards and he used all but 16 of them. So, the number of cards used is \(52 - 16 = 36\).

Next, given that Eugene used 75 toothpicks per card, we can calculate the total number of toothpicks used: \(36 \times 75 = 2700\).

A box of toothpicks contains 450 toothpicks, so to find out how many boxes Eugene used, we divide the total number of toothpicks by the number of toothpicks per box: \(2700 \div 450 = 6\).

Therefore, Eugene used 6 boxes of toothpicks to create his model house.

Eugene used all but 16 of the 52 cards from a deck, so he used \( 52 - 16 = 36 \) cards. Each card required 75 toothpicks, so the total number of toothpicks used is \( 36 \times 75 \).

\[ 36 \times 75 = 2700 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Eugene's model house can be built with toothpicks contained in boxes of 450, the number of boxes he used is the ceiling of the division of the total number of toothpicks by the number of toothpicks per box.

\[ \left\lceil \frac{2700}{450} \right\rceil \]

Calculating the division gives:

\[ \frac{2700}{450} = 6 \]

Since 2700 divided by 450 exactly equals 6, Eugene used exactly 6 boxes of toothpicks.

First, let's determine the number of cards Eugene used to build his house. We know there were 52 cards in the deck, and he used all but 16 of them. Therefore, the number of cards used is $52 - 16 = 36$ cards.

Next, we know that for each card, Eugene used 75 toothpicks. So, the total number of toothpicks used would be $36 \times 75$.

Finally, we need to determine how many boxes of toothpicks Eugene used. Since one box contains 450 toothpicks, we divide the total number of toothpicks by 450 to find the number of boxes used.

Let's calculate the total number of toothpicks and then convert it to boxes:
\[
\text{Total toothpicks} = 36 \times 75 = 2700
\]
\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{2700}{450} = 6
\]

So, Eugene used 6 boxes of toothpicks to create his model house.

To determine how many boxes of toothpicks Eugene used, we need to first calculate the total number of toothpicks he used.

Eugene used all but 16 cards from a deck of 52 cards. Therefore, the number of cards he used is:
\[ 52 - 16 = 36 \]

Since each card uses 75 toothpicks, the total number of toothpicks used is:
\[ 36 \times 75 = 2700 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes of toothpicks are required to get at least 2700 toothpicks. Since each box contains 450 toothpicks, we divide 2700 by 450 to find the number of boxes:

\[ \frac{2700}{450} = 6 \]

Therefore, Eugene used 6 boxes of toothpicks to create his model house.
