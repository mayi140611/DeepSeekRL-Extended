Let's denote the cost of a dozen apples as \( A \) and the cost of a bunch of bananas as \( B \).

From the information given:
1. Tony paid $7 for 2 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas.
   \[ 2A + B = 7 \]

2. Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas.
   \[ A + B = 5 \]

To find the cost of a bunch of bananas (\( B \)), we can solve these two equations. Subtract the second equation from the first:

\[ (2A + B) - (A + B) = 7 - 5 \]
\[ 2A + B - A - B = 2 \]
\[ A = 2 \]

Now that we know the cost of a dozen apples (\( A \)) is $2, we can substitute \( A \) back into the equation for Arnold's purchase to find \( B \):

\[ 2 + B = 5 \]
\[ B = 5 - 2 \]
\[ B = 3 \]

Therefore, a bunch of bananas costs $3.

From the information given, we need to determine the cost of a bunch of bananas. 

Firstly, let's express the total cost in terms of numbers and variables.
- Tony paid $7 for 2 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas, so the cost of 2 dozens of apples plus cost of one bunch of bananas is $7.
- Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas, so the cost of 1 dozen of apples plus cost of one bunch of bananas is $5.

Let's denote:
- Cost of one dozen apples as \(A\) (for Tony)
- Cost of one dozen apples as \(B\) (for Arnold)
- Cost of one bunch of bananas as \(B\) (since the number of bunches of bananas paid for is 1 for both Tony and Arnold)

From the information:
\[ 2A + B = 7 \]
\[ A + B = 5 \]

Now, to solve for \(B\), we can subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (2A + B) - (A + B) = 7 - 5 \]
\[ 2A + B - A - B = 2 \]
\[ A = 2 \] 

Now substitute \(A\) back into the inequality:
\[ 2 + B = 5 \]
\[ B = 5 - 2 \]
\[ B = 3 \]

So, the cost of a bunch of bananas is $3.

We can solve this problem by setting up a system of equations. Let \( A \) be the cost of a dozen apples and \( B \) be the cost of a bunch of bananas. We can represent the given information as follows:

1. Tony's purchase: \( 2A + B = 7 \)
2. Arnold's purchase: \( A + B = 5 \)

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \( 2A + B = 7 \)
2. \( A + B = 5 \)

To solve for \( B \), we can use the elimination method. First, we can eliminate \( B \) by subtracting the second equation from the first equation.

\[ (2A + B) - (A + B) = 7 - 5 \]
\[ 2A + B - A - B = 2 \]
\[ A = 2 \]

Now that we know \( A = 2 \), we can substitute this value back into the second equation to solve for \( B \).

\[ A + B = 5 \]
\[ 2 + B = 5 \]
\[ B = 5 - 2 \]
\[ B = 3 \]

Therefore, a bunch of bananas costs \( \$3 \).

Let's denote the cost of a dozen apples as \( A \) dollars and the cost of a bunch of bananas as \( B \) dollars.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. \( 2A + B = 7 \) (Tony's purchase)
2. \( A + B = 5 \) (Arnold's purchase)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, subtract the second equation from the first:

\( (2A + B) - (A + B) = 7 - 5 \)

This simplifies to:

\( A = 2 \) dollars for a dozen apples.

Now substitute \( A = 2 \) back into the second equation:

\( 2 + B = 5 \)

Solving for \( B \):

\( B = 5 - 2 \)

\( B = 3 \) dollars for a bunch of bananas.

Therefore, a bunch of bananas costs $3.

Let's denote the cost of one dozen apples as A and the cost of one bunch of bananas as B.

From the information given, we can form the following two equations:

1. For Tony: \( 2A + B = 7 \)
2. For Arnold: \( A + B = 5 \)

We need to solve these equations to find the cost of a bunch of bananas, B.

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A:

\( (2A + B) - (A + B) = 7 - 5 \)

This simplifies to:

\( A = 2 \)

Now that we know the cost of one dozen apples is $2, we can substitute this value into the second equation to find the cost of a bunch of bananas:

\( 2 + B = 5 \)

Solving for B, we get:

\( B = 5 - 2 \)

\( B = 3 \)

So, the cost of a bunch of bananas is $3.

We will solve this by first forming equations based on the given information:
1) Tony's apples cost twice as many times as Arnold's: 2x = 1
2) Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and a bunch of bananas: 5 = y

From the first equation, we find that a dozen apples cost $2.

We can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for the cost of a bunch of bananas (y):
5 = y
y = $5

Therefore, a bunch of bananas costs $5.

To determine the cost of a bunch of bananas, let's set up some algebraic relationships first. We will use variables to represent the costs of apples and bananas.

1. Let \( A \) be the cost of one dozen apples.
2. Let \( B \) be the cost of one bunch of bananas.

From the given information, we can write two equations based on Tony's and Arnold's payments:

For Tony:
\[
2A + B = 7
\]

For Arnold:
\[
A + B = 5
\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
2A + B = 7 \\
A + B = 5
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the substitution method.

Step 1: Solve the second equation for \( B \):
\[
B = 5 - A
\]

Step 2: Substitute \( B \) from the above equation into the first equation:
\[
2A + (5 - A) = 7
\]

Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( A \):
\[
2A + 5 - A = 7 \\
\]
\[
A + 5 = 7 \\
\]
\[
A = 2
\]

Now that we have \( A = 2 \), we can substitute this value back into the second original equation to find \( B \):

\[
A + B = 5 \\
2 + B = 5 \\
B = 3
\]

So, the cost of one bunch of bananas is \( B = 3 \).

Therefore, the answer is a bunch of bananas costs **3** dollars.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1) 2A + B = 7 (Tony's purchase)
2) A + B = 5 (Arnold's purchase)

We need to solve these equations to find the value of B (cost of the bunch of bananas).

From the second equation, we can express A in terms of B:
A = 5 - B

Now we substitute this expression for A in the first equation:
2(5 - B) + B = 7

Expanding this, we get:
10 - 2B + B = 7

Combining like terms:
10 - B = 7

Subtract 10 from both sides:
-B = 7 - 10
-B = -3

Multiply both sides by -1:
B = 3
