#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out how many slices are left, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices initially: 2 cakes * 8 slices/cake = 16 slices.
2. Calculate the number of slices given away to friends: 1/4 * 16 slices = 4 slices.
3. Calculate the remaining slices after giving some to friends: 16 slices - 4 slices = 12 slices.
4. Calculate the number of slices given away to family: 1/3 * 12 slices = 4 slices.
5. Calculate the remaining slices after giving some to family: 12 slices - 4 slices = 8 slices.
6. Calculate the number of slices eaten by Alex: 3 slices.
7. Calculate the remaining slices after Alex eats: 8 slices - 3 slices = 5 slices.

system
Let's calculate the total number of slices first:

- Alex has 2 cakes, each cut into 8 slices, so he has a total of 2 * 8 = 16 slices.
- A fourth of the slices are given away to friends, which is 16 * (1/4) = 4 slices.
- After giving away 4 slices, Alex has 16 - 4 = 12 slices left.
- A third of the remaining slices are given away to family, which is 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices.
- After giving away 4 slices, Alex has 12 - 4 = 8 slices left.
- Alex eats 3 slices, so the number of slices left is 8 - 3 = 5 slices.

Initially, Alex has 2 cakes with 8 slices each, so he has a total of \(2 \times 8 = 16\) slices. A fourth of the slices are given away to his friends:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \text{ slices}
\]
This leaves \(16 - 4 = 12\) slices. A third of these remaining slices are given to his family:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices}
\]
After giving these slices to his family, the number of slices left is:
\[
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ slices}
\]
Alex eats 3 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[
8 - 3 = 5 \text{ slices}

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many slices of cake are left.

1. **Total number of slices:**
   Alex has 2 cakes, each cut into 8 slices.
   \[
   2 \text{ cakes} \times 8 \text{ slices per cake} = 16 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Slices given to friends:**
   A fourth of the slices are given to his friends.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 16 \text{ slices} = 4 \text{ slices}
   \]
   Remaining slices after giving to friends:
   \[
   16 \text{ slices} - 4 \text{ slices} = 12 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices given to family:**
   A third of the remaining slices are given to his family.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices} = 4 \text{ slices}
   \]
   Remaining slices after giving to family:
   \[
   12 \text{ slices} - 4 \text{ slices} = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Slices eaten by Alex:**
   Alex eats 3 slices.
   Remaining slices after Alex eats:
   \[
   8 \text{ slices} - 3 \text{ slices} = 5 \text{ slices}
   \]

So, the number of slices of the cake left is \( \boxed{5} \).

Initially, Alex has 2 cakes, each cut into 8 slices, so he has \(2 \times 8 = 16\) slices of cake.

A fourth of the slices are given away to his friends, so he gives away \(\frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4\) slices. Therefore, the remaining slices are \(16 - 4 = 12\).

A third of the remaining slices are then given away to his family, so he gives away \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\) slices. The remaining slices after giving to his family are \(12 - 4 = 8\).

Finally, Alex eats 3 slices, leaving \(8 - 3 = 5\) slices of cake.

First, calculate the total number of slices Alex initially has:
\[ 2 \text{ cakes} \times 8 \text{ slices per cake} = 16 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine how many slices are given to friends:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 \text{ slices} = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Subtract the slices given to friends from the total:
\[ 16 \text{ slices} - 4 \text{ slices} = 12 \text{ slices} \]

Then, determine how many slices are given to family:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices} = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Subtract the slices given to family from the remaining slices:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 4 \text{ slices} = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Now, subtract the slices Alex eats:
\[ 8 \text{ slices} - 3 \text{ slices} = 5 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is 5.

First, let's calculate the total number of cake slices Alex has initially. Since Alex has 2 cakes, each cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \).

Next, we calculate the slices given away to friends. A fourth of the slices are given away, so \( \frac{16}{4} = 4 \) slices are given to friends.

After giving away slices to friends, the number of remaining slices is \( 16 - 4 = 12 \).

Then, we calculate the slices given away to family. A third of the remaining slices are given away, so \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) slices are given to family.

After giving away slices to family, the number of remaining slices is \( 12 - 4 = 8 \).

Lastly, we subtract the slices Alex eats. If Alex eats 3 slices, the number of slices left is \( 8 - 3 = 5 \).

So, Alex has 5 slices left.

To determine the number of cake slices left, we start by calculating the total number of slices of cake.

Alex has 2 cakes with 8 slices each:

So, there are 16 slices of cake initially.

Next, we calculate the number of slices given away to his friends. A fourth of the slices are given away:
\[ \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]
So, 4 slices are given away to friends.

After giving away 4 slices, the remaining number of slices is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]
Then, we consider that a third of the remaining slices are given away to his family:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]
So, 4 slices are given away to family.

After giving away 4 slices to family, the remaining number of slices is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]
Finally, we subtract the 3 slices Alex eats:
