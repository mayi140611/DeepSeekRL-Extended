Reasoning:
Let's calculate this step-by-step:
1. First, find the total number of nuts eaten: \( \frac{5}{6} \times 30 = 25 \) nuts.
2. Subtract the number of nuts eaten from the total: \( 30 - 25 = 5 \) nuts remaining.

Answer:
There are 5 nuts left.

<reasoning>
To find out how many nuts were left, we first need to calculate how many nuts were eaten and then subtract that number from the total number of nuts.
Given that 5/6 of the nuts were eaten, we can determine the number of nuts eaten by multiplying the total number of nuts by 5/6.
Total nuts = 30
Nuts eaten = 5/6 * 30 = 25
Now that we know the number of nuts eaten, we can subtract this from the total number of nuts to find out how many nuts were left.
Nuts left = Total nuts - Nuts eaten = 30 - 25 = 5
Therefore, there were 5 nuts left.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####

<reasoning>
To find out how many nuts were left after 5/6 of them were eaten, we need to first calculate how many nuts were eaten. Since there were 30 nuts in total and 5/6 were eaten, we can calculate this as follows:

Nuts eaten = Total nuts * (5/6)
             = 30 * (5/6)
             = 25

So, 25 nuts were eaten, leaving 30 - 25 = 5 nuts left.

To find out how many nuts are left, we first need to calculate how many nuts were eaten. 

Given that 5/6 of the nuts were eaten, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{5}{6} \times 30
\]

Calculating this gives us:

\[
\frac{5 \times 30}{6} = \frac{150}{6} = 25
\]

So, 25 nuts were eaten.

Now, subtract the number of eaten nuts from the total number of nuts to find out how many nuts are left:

\[
30 - 25 = 5
\]

Therefore, there are 5 nuts left.

To find out how many nuts were left, we need to first determine how many nuts were eaten. Given that 5/6 of the nuts were consumed, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of nuts by 5/6. 
Then, we simply subtract this number from the initial total to find the number of nuts left.

So the number of nuts left is: 30 - (30 * 5/6) .

The total number of nuts initially is 30. Given that \( \frac{5}{6} \) of the nuts were eaten, we first need to calculate how many nuts this fraction represents. 

First, find the fraction of the nuts that were eaten:
\[
\frac{5}{6} \times 30 = 25 \text{ nuts}
\]

Then, subtract the number of eaten nuts from the initial total to find the number of nuts left:
\[
30 - 25 = 5 \text{ nuts}
\]

To find out how many nuts were left, we first need to calculate how many nuts were eaten. Given that 5/6 of the nuts were eaten, we can subtract this fraction from the total number of nuts to find out how many nuts are left.

We know that 30 nuts were eaten, which is 5/6 of the total. Therefore, the number of nuts eaten, 30, can be represented as the fraction of the total nuts. To find the total number of nuts, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{5}{6} \times \text{Total Nuts} = 30 \]

Solving for the total nuts gives us:

\[ \text{Total Nuts} = \frac{30}{\frac{5}{6}} = 30 \times \frac{6}{5} = 36 \]

So, there were 36 nuts in total. Since 30 nuts were eaten, the number of nuts left is:

\[ \text{Nuts Left} = \text{Total Nuts} - \text{Nuts Eaten} = 36 - 30 = 6 \]

Therefore, there were 6 nuts left.

To find out how many nuts were left after 5/6 of them were eaten, we start with the total number of nuts, which is 30. 

If 5/6 of the nuts were eaten, then 1/6 of the nuts remained. We calculate this by subtracting the eaten nuts from the total:

$30 \times \frac{1}{6} = 5$

So, 5 nuts were left.

To find out how many nuts were left after 5/6 of them were eaten, we first need to determine what fraction of the nuts remain. Since 5/6 were eaten, the fraction that remained is \(1 - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6}\).

Next, calculate the number of nuts that were left based on the total number of nuts, which is 30.

To find out how many nuts were left after some were eaten, we first need to find out how many nuts were eaten. 

We know that 5/6 of the nuts were eaten, so we can calculate the number of eaten nuts by multiplying the total number of nuts (30) by 5/6:

Number of eaten nuts = 30 * 5/6 = 25

Now that we know 25 nuts were eaten, we can find out how many nuts are left by subtracting the number of eaten nuts from the total number of nuts:

Number of nuts left = Total nuts - Eaten nuts = 30 - 25 = 5

So, there are 5 nuts left.

To find out how many nuts were eaten, you can calculate the fraction of the total number of nuts that was eaten and then multiply it by the total number of nuts. In this case, 5/6 of the nuts were eaten, and there are 30 nuts in total. So, the number of nuts eaten is \( 30 \times \frac{5}{6} \).

The remaining nuts can be calculated by subtracting the number of nuts eaten from the total number of nuts. The total number of nuts left will be \( 30 - (30 \times \frac{5}{6}) \).
