###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Mara and Riley went to a carnival, Mara rode the bumper car two times, Riley rode the space shuttle four times, and they both rode the Ferris wheel three times. If a ticket for a bumper car cost $2, a ticket for a space shuttle cost $4, and a ticket for a Ferris wheel cost $5, how much money did they spend?

First, we need to calculate the cost for each ride:

- For the bumper cars: Mara rode 2 times, so the cost is \( 2 \times \$2 = \$4 \).
- For the space shuttles: Riley rode 4 times, so the cost is \( 4 \times \$4 = \$16 \).
- For the Ferris wheels: Both Mara and Riley rode 3 times each, so the cost for each is \( 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \). Since there are two of Mara, the total cost for her is \( 2 \times \$15 = \$30 \), and the total for Riley is \( 2 \times \$15 = \$30 \). 

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount of money they spent:

- For the bumper cars: \( \$4 \)
- For the space shuttles: \( \$16 \)
- For the Ferris wheels: \( \$30 + \$30 = \$60 \)

- Total amount spent: \( \$4 + \$16 + \$60 = \$80 \).

To determine how much money Mara and Riley spent at the carnival, we need to calculate the cost for each ride they took and then sum these costs.

For Mara:
- Bumper car: \(2 \times \$2 = \$4\)
- Space shuttle: \(4 \times \$4 = \$16\)
- Ferris wheel: \(3 \times \$5 = \$15\)
Total cost for Mara: \( \$4 + \$16 + \$15 = \$35\)

For Riley:
- Bumper car: \(4 \times \$2 = \$8\)
- Space shuttle: \(4 \times \$4 = \$16\)
- Ferris wheel: \(3 \times \$5 = \$15\)
Total cost for Riley: \( \$8 + \$16 + \$15 = \$39\)

Now we add the total costs for Mara and Riley to find the total amount spent by both:
Total spent by Mara and Riley: \( \$35 + \$39 = \$74 \)

Therefore, Mara and Riley spent a total of \$74.

To determine the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the cost for each ride and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for Mara:
- Mara rode the bumper car 2 times, with each ticket costing $2.
  \[
  \text{Cost for bumper cars for Mara} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Riley:
- Riley rode the space shuttle 4 times, with each ticket costing $4.
  \[
  \text{Cost for space shuttles for Riley} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Then, let's calculate the cost for both Mara and Riley riding the Ferris wheel:
- Both Mara and Riley rode the Ferris wheel 3 times, with each ticket costing $5.
  \[
  \text{Cost for Ferris wheels for both} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum all the costs:
- Mara: $4
- Riley: $16
- Both Ferris wheels: $15

Total cost:
\[
4 + 16 + 15 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for Mara and Riley based on the number of rides they took. Mara rode the bumper car two times, Riley rode the space shuttle four times, and both of them rode the Ferris wheel three times. The cost of a ticket for a bumper car is $2, for a space shuttle is $4, and for a Ferris wheel is $5.

The total cost Mara spent is:
(2 rides of bumper car * $2 per ride) + (3 rides of Ferris wheel * $5 per ride) = $4 + $15 = $19.

The total cost Riley spent is:
(4 rides of space shuttle * $4 per ride) + (3 rides of Ferris wheel * $5 per ride) = $16 + $15 = $31.

The total cost they both spent is:
$19 + $31 = $50.

Therefore, the total money they spent is $50.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the individual expenses and sum them up.

First, we calculate the cost for each ride:
- Mara's bumper car rides: Mara rode the bumper car 2 times, and each ride costs $2. So, the cost for the bumper car rides is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Riley's space shuttle rides: Riley rode the space shuttle 4 times, and each ride costs $4. So, the cost for the space shuttle rides is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) dollars.
- Both Mara and Riley rode the Ferris wheel 3 times each. So, the cost for the Ferris wheel rides is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars for Mara and \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars for Riley, which totals \(15 + 15 = 30\) dollars together.

Next, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost for bumper car rides: $4
- Total cost for space shuttle rides: $16
- Total cost for Ferris wheel rides: $30

The total amount spent is \(4 + 16 + 30 = 50\) dollars.

Therefore, Mara and Riley spent $50 in total.

Finally, we calculate the cost for both Mara and Riley's ride:

- Total for both: \(\$20 + \$15 = \$35\)

Therefore, Mara and Riley spend a total of \$35 at the carnival.

For Mara:
- She rode the bumper car twice, so the cost is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- She rode the Ferris wheel three times, so the cost is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

For Riley:
- She rode the space shuttle four times, so the cost is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) dollars.
- She also rode the Ferris wheel three times, so the cost is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, Riley's total cost is \(16 + 15 = 31\) dollars.

Now, to find the total amount of money they spent, we add Mara's total cost and Riley's total cost:
- Total cost = Mara's total cost \(+\) Riley's total cost \(= 19 + 31 = 50\) dollars.
