To solve this, first we calculate how long it takes Jim to cover the 1 mile gap, given his speed of 9 miles per hour.
Time = distance / speed = 1 / 9 hours.

Convert this time into minutes since the answer is required in minutes.
1/9 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 6.67 minutes.

Thus, Jim will catch up to Bob in approximately 6.67 minutes.

First, we need to determine the relative speed at which Jim is gaining on Bob. Jim runs at 9 miles per hour and Bob runs at 6 miles per hour, so Jim gains 3 miles per hour on Bob (9 - 6 = 3).

Since Bob has a 1 mile head start, we need to figure out how long it will take Jim to catch up to this 1 mile difference. We can use the formula distance = speed * time to find out how long it will take Jim to catch up.

1 mile = 3 miles/hour * time
time = 1 mile / 3 miles/hour = 1/3 hour

Now we need to convert this time into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1/3 hour is equal to 20 minutes (1/3 * 60 = 20).

So, it will take Jim 20 minutes to catch Bob.

To determine how long it will take for Jim to catch up to Bob, we need to consider their speeds and the head start Bob has. 

1. First, calculate the relative speed of Jim compared to Bob. Jim runs at 9 mph and Bob runs at 6 mph, so Jim is catching up at a rate of \(9 - 6 = 3\) mph.
2. Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Jim to cover the 1 mile head start at this relative speed. This can be calculated using the formula \(\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}\).
\[ \text{time} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{3 \text{ mph}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} \]

3. Finally, convert this time into minutes:
\[ \text{time in minutes} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Jim 20 minutes to catch up to Bob.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Jim to catch up to Bob. 

First, let's calculate how far Bob runs in the time it takes for Jim to close the 1 mile gap.

Bob's speed is 6 miles per hour, and Jim's speed is 9 miles per hour. The relative speed at which Jim is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds:

Relative speed = Jim's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 9 miles per hour - 6 miles per hour
Relative speed = 3 miles per hour

This means that Jim is closing the 1 mile gap at a rate of 3 miles per hour. To catch up with Bob, Jim needs to close this gap entirely:

Time to close the gap = Distance to cover / Relative speed
Time to close the gap = 1 mile / 3 miles per hour
Time to close the gap = 1/3 hours

Now, we need to convert this time into minutes:

Time in minutes = Time in hours × 60
Time in minutes = 1/3 hours × 60 minutes per hour
Time in minutes = 20 minutes

So, it will take Jim 20 minutes to catch up to Bob.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Jim to catch up to Bob, who has a head start of 1 mile before Jim starts running.

First, let's calculate the relative speed between Jim and Bob. Since Jim runs at 9 miles per hour and Bob runs at 6 miles per hour, Jim is gaining on Bob at a rate of \(9 - 6 = 3\) miles per hour.

Next, we need to determine how long it takes for Jim to cover the 1-mile distance between them. Using the formula distance = speed × time, we can rearrange it to find time = distance / speed. Here, the distance is 1 mile and the relative speed is 3 miles per hour, so the time it takes for Jim to catch up to Bob is \(1 \text{ mile} / 3 \text{ miles/hour} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour}\).

To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[
\frac{1}{3} \text{ hour} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ minutes}.
\]

So, it will take Jim 20 minutes to catch up to Bob.

To determine how long it will take for Jim to catch Bob, we first need to calculate the relative speed of Jim with respect to Bob. Since Jim runs 9 miles per hour and Bob runs only 6 miles per hour, the relative speed is \(9 - 6 = 3\) miles per hour.

This means that Jim is gaining on Bob at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Bob has a 1 mile head start, so we need to find out how long it will take for Jim to close that gap.

The time it takes for Jim to catch up can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} \]

Here, the distance is 1 mile and the relative speed is 3 miles per hour. So,
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} \]

Since the question asks for the time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Jim 20 minutes to catch Bob.

To determine how long it will take for Jim to catch up to Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Jim to close the one mile head start.

First, we find out how quickly Jim is closing the gap. Since Jim runs at 9 miles per hour and Bob runs at 6 miles per hour, the relative speed at which Jim is closing the gap is \( 9 - 6 = 3 \) miles per hour.

Next, we need to convert the head start distance from miles to hours because Jim's speed is given in miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, a one mile head start is \( \frac{60}{1} \) minutes, or simply 60 minutes.

Now, we divide the head start time by the relative speed to find out how long it takes for Jim to catch up to Bob:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Head Start Distance (in hours)}}{\text{Relative Speed (in miles per hour)}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} \]

To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 \]
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = 20 \]

So, it will take 20 minutes for Jim to catch up to Bob.

To determine how long it will take for Jim to catch up to Bob, we first need to calculate the time it takes for Jim to close the 1 mile gap. Since Jim runs faster than Bob (9 mph vs 6 mph), he is gaining on Bob at a rate of 3 miles per hour. This means Jim will close the 1 mile gap at a rate of 3 miles per hour.

To find out how long it takes Jim to close this gap, we use the formula: time = distance / rate. Plugging in the values, we get:

time = 1 mile / 3 miles per hour = 1/3 hour.

Since we want the time in minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes per hour:

\( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 \) minutes = 20 minutes.

So, Jim will catch up to Bob in 20 minutes.

Bob has a 1 mile head start. We need to find out how long it takes for Jim to cover this 1 mile gap.

First, we find the speed difference between Jim and Bob. Jim runs at 9 mph, and Bob runs at 6 mph, so the difference is \(9 - 6 = 3\) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Jim to catch up to Bob by dividing the head start by the speed difference: \(1 \text{ mile} / 3 \text{ mph} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour}\).

Since we need the time in minutes, we convert \(\frac{1}{3} \text{ hour}\) to minutes by multiplying by 60: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

So, it will take Jim 20 minutes to catch up to Bob.

To determine how many minutes it will take before Jim catches up to Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Jim to cover the initial 1 mile head-start and then find out how long it takes for Jim to close the gap at their respective speeds.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jim to catch up to Bob. Since Jim runs at 9 miles per hour and Bob runs at 6 miles per hour, the relative speed at which Jim is closing the gap is:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it takes for Jim to cover the 1 mile head-start at this relative speed. Using the formula:

To determine how long it takes for Jim to catch up to Bob, we'll first calculate their relative speed. Since Jim runs at 9 miles per hour and Bob at 6 miles per hour, Jim gains 3 miles per hour on Bob (9 - 6 = 3). Bob has a 1 mile head start.

We'll set up the equation for when Jim has caught up. Let \( t \) be the number of hours it takes for Jim to catch up. In that time, Jim would have traveled \( 9t \) miles and Bob would have traveled \( 6t \) miles, with Bob starting 1 mile ahead.

Jim will catch up when he has traveled the 1 mile head start plus the distance Bob has traveled. So:
\[ 9t = 6t + 1 \]
Solving for \( t \):
\[ 9t - 6t = 1 \]
\[ 3t = 1 \]
\[ t = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to convert this time from hours to minutes:
\[ t = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jim will catch up to Bob in 20 minutes.

Given that Jim runs at 9 miles per hour and Bob runs at 6 miles per hour, the relative speed at which Jim is catching up to Bob is \(9 - 6 = 3\) miles per hour.

Since Bob has a 1 mile head start, we can find the time it takes for Jim to catch up by dividing the head start distance by the relative speed. That is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Jim to catch up to Bob after Bob has a 1 mile head start. 

First, let's calculate how far Bob can run while Jim is still catching up. Since Bob runs at 6 miles per hour and he has a 1 mile head start, the time it takes for Bob to cover this 1 mile distance is:
\[ \text{Time for Bob to close the gap} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hour} \]

During this time, Jim is running. Jim runs at 9 miles per hour, so we need to find out how many miles Jim runs in the same amount of time it takes Bob to close his 1 mile gap. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance Jim runs in } \frac{1}{6} \text{ hour} = 9 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ miles} \]

So, when Jim catches up to Bob, he will have run a total of 1.5 miles plus the 1 mile head start Bob had, making it a total of 2.5 miles.

Now, to find out how long it will take Jim to run this distance, we use his speed:
\[ \text{Time taken by Jim} = \frac{2.5 \text{ miles}}{9 \text{ miles/hour}} = \frac{2.5}{9} \text{ hour} \]

Since we need to find the time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:
\[ \text{Time taken in minutes} = \frac{2.5}{9} \times 60 = 17.78 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Jim approximately 18 minutes to catch up to Bob.

To determine how many minutes it will take for Jim to catch up to Bob, we first need to calculate the time it takes for Jim to cover the 1 mile gap given Bob's initial head start.
