Ursula's boss told her to shorten the commercial by 30%. This means the new length of the commercial will be 100% - 30% = 70% of the original length.
So, the new length of the commercial will be 70% of 30 seconds = 0.70 * 30 = 21 seconds.

To find out how long the commercial will be after Ursula makes the desired changes, we need to calculate a 30% reduction from its original 30 seconds.

First, determine 30% of 30 seconds:
\[ 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, subtract this amount from the original length to find the reduced length:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ seconds} \]

After Ursula makes the desired changes, the commercial will be 21 seconds long.

system
To find the new length of the commercial after a reduction of 30%, we first calculate 30% of the original 30 seconds.

30% * 30 seconds = 0.30 * 30 seconds

Now, we calculate the total reduction:

0.30 * 30 seconds = 9 seconds

This means the commercial is reduced by 9 seconds. To find the new length of the commercial, we subtract this reduction from the original length:

30 seconds - 9 seconds = 21 seconds

Therefore, the commercial will be 21 seconds long after Ursula makes the desired changes.

Currently, the commercial is 30 seconds long. Ursula is instructed to shorten it by 30%. To find out by how much, we calculate 30% of 30 seconds: (30/100) * 30 = 9 seconds. So, Ursula needs to shorten the commercial by 9 seconds. 

Now, subtract the amount of reduction from the original time: 30 - 9 = 21 seconds.

To find the length of the commercial after Ursula makes the desired changes, we need to calculate 30% of the original 30 seconds and subtract that from the original length.

30% of 30 seconds is calculated as follows:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 \text{ seconds} = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, subtract the 30% reduction from the original length:
\[ 30 \text{ seconds} - 9 \text{ seconds} = 21 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the commercial will be 21 seconds long after Ursula makes the desired changes.

Initially, the commercial is 30 seconds long. Ursula decides to shorten it by 30%. To calculate the reduction in seconds, we can find 1/3 of the original duration, which is \(30 \times \frac{30}{100} = 9\) seconds. Adding this to the original duration gives us the new length of the commercial.

</answer>
<reasoning>
First, we calculate 30% of the original 30 seconds, which is \(30 \times \frac{30}{100} = 9\) seconds. This 9 seconds represents the decrease in the length of the commercial. Adding this to the original 30 seconds gives us a new length of \(30 + 9 = 39\) seconds.

The initial length of the commercial is 30 seconds. To find the reduced length, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9 seconds

So, after reducing it by 9 seconds, the new length of the commercial will be:

30 seconds - 9 seconds = 21 seconds

To find the length of the commercial after Ursula shortens it by 30%, you can calculate 30% of the original length and subtract that from the original length.

Original length = 30 seconds
Decrease = 30% of 30 seconds = 0.30 * 30 = 9 seconds

New length = Original length - Decrease
= 30 - 9 = 21 seconds

To find the length of the commercial after Ursula shortens it by 30%, we can first calculate 30% of 30 seconds.

30% of 30 seconds = 0.30 * 30 seconds = 9 seconds

30 seconds - 9 seconds = 21 seconds

Therefore, the commercial will be 21 seconds long after Ursula makes the desired changes.

The original length of the commercial is 30 seconds. To reduce the length by 30%, we calculate 30% of 30 seconds and subtract that from the original length.

30% of 30 seconds = 0.30 * 30 = 9 seconds.

Now, to find the new length after the reduction:

New length = Original length - Reduction
New length = 30 seconds - 9 seconds
New length = 21 seconds.

To find the length of the commercial after a 30% reduction, we first calculate what 30% of 30 seconds is:

\( 30\% = 0.30 \)

\( 30 \text{ seconds} \times 0.30 = 9 \text{ seconds} \)

Now we subtract the 9 seconds from the original 30 seconds to find the new length:
