system
To determine how much Sean spends, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item he purchases and then sum them up.

1. The cost of each almond croissant and salami and cheese croissant is $4.50 each. Since he buys 1 of each, the cost for these items is \(4.50 + 4.50 = 9.00\).

2. The cost of the plain croissant is $3.00.

3. The cost of the loaf of focaccia is $4.00.

4. The cost of each latte is $2.50 and he buys 2, so the cost for the lattes is \(2.50 \times 2 = 5.00\).

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[ 9.00 + 3.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 21.00 \]

So, Sean spends a total of $21.00.

To determine how much Sean spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item he purchased and then sum them up.

1. **Almond Croissant and Salami and Cheese Croissant:**
   - Each is $4.50.
   - Total for both: \( 4.50 \times 2 = 9.00 \).

2. **Plain Croissant:**
   - $3.00.

3. **Loaf of Focaccia:**
   - $4.00.

4. **Lattes:**
   - Each costs $2.50.
   - Total for 2 lattes: \( 2.50 \times 2 = 5.00 \).

Now, we add up all these amounts to find the total expenditure:
\[
9.00 + 3.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 21.00
\]

So, Sean spent a total of $21.00.

To determine how much Sean spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and item he purchased, then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the almond and salami croissants:
Each almond croissant and salami croissant costs $4.50, and since Sean buys 2 of each:
\[ 2 \times 4.50 = 9.00 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plain croissant and the loaf of focaccia:
The plain croissant costs $3.00, and the loaf of focaccia costs $4.00, so:
\[ 3.00 + 4.00 = 7.00 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the 2 lattes:
Each latte costs $2.50, and since Sean buys 2:
\[ 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum all these costs:
\[ 9.00 + 7.00 + 5.00 = 21.00 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Sean spent a total of $21.00.

Let's calculate the cost of each type of croissant and the lattes Sean buys:

- 1 almond croissant and 1 salami and cheese croissant cost $4.50 each.
- Therefore, for both croissants, it costs $4.50 * 2 = $9.
- 1 plain croissant costs $3.00.
- 1 loaf of focaccia costs $4.00.
- 2 lattes each cost $2.50, so for both lattes, it costs $2.50 * 2 = $5.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Total cost for croissants and focaccia: $9
- Total cost for lattes: $5

So, Sean's total spending is $9 + $5 = $14.

To calculate the total amount Sean spent, we need to first determine the cost of each type of pastry and sandwich he bought on Sundays.

The cost of a almond croissant is $4.50 each, so two almond croissants cost:
\[ 2 \times \$4.50 = \$9.00 \]

The cost of a salami and cheese croissant is also $4.50 each, so two of these are:
\[ 2 \times \$4.50 = \$9.00 \]

The plain croissant is $3.00 each, so:
\[ 1 \times \$3.00 = \$3.00 \]

The loaf of focaccia costs $4.00, and he buys one, so that's:
\[ 1 \times \$4.00 = \$4.00 \]

The two lattes cost $2.50 each, so:
\[ 2 \times \$2.50 = \$5.00 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total:
\[ \$9.00 + \$9.00 + \$3.00 + \$4.00 + \$5.00 = \$30.00 \]

Therefore, Sean spent a total of \$30.00 on his Sunday purchase.

First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Sean buys 1 almond croissant and 1 salami and cheese croissant each day. The prices for these croissants are $4.50 each. This means he spends $4.50 + $4.50 = $9.00 on these two types of croissants each day.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the plain croissant and the loaf of focaccia. On Sunday, he buys one plain croissant for $3.00 and the loaf of focaccia for $4.00. Therefore, he spends $3.00 + $4.00 = $7.00 on these items.

Finally, let's look at the lattes. Sean buys 2 lattes each Sunday, with each latte costing $2.50. This means he spends 2 * $2.50 = $5.00 on lattes.

To find out the total amount Sean spends on Sunday, we need to sum up all the costs:
- Croissants: $9.00
- Plain croissant and focaccia: $7.00
- Lattes: $5.00

Total amount = $9.00 + $7.00 + $5.00 = $21.00

Therefore, Sean spends $21.00 on Sunday.

To determine how much Sean spends in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of croissant, the plain croissant, the loaf of focaccia, and the lattes he buys on Sundays. 

1. Almond croissant: $4.50 each
   He buys 1, so the cost is $4.50.

2. Salami and cheese croissant: $4.50 each
   He buys 1, so the cost is $4.50.

3. Plain croissant: $3.00
   He buys 1, so the cost is $3.00.

4. Loaf of focaccia: $4.00
   He buys 1, so the cost is $4.00.

5. Lattes: $2.50 each
   He buys 2, so the cost is $2.50 * 2 = $5.00.

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount spent:

- Almond croissant: $4.50
- Salami and cheese croissant: $4.50
- Plain croissant: $3.00
- Loaf of focaccia: $4.00
- Lattes: $5.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $4.50 + $3.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $21.00
