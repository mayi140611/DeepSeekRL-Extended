###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

First, calculate the number of classrooms with 30 desks and how many students those desks accommodate:
- One-third of the 15 classrooms have 30 desks: \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) classrooms.
- Each of these classrooms accommodates 30 students, so \( 5 \times 30 = 150 \) students are accommodated.

Next, calculate the number of classrooms with 25 desks:
- There are \( 15 - 5 = 10 \) classrooms with 25 desks each.
- These classrooms have 25 desks, so each accommodates 25 students, totaling \( 10 \times 25 = 250 \) students.

Adding these two totals gives the maximum number of students the school can accommodate:
- \( 150 + 250 = 400 \) students.

Therefore, the school can accommodate a total of 400 students.

To determine the total number of students that the school can accommodate, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the classrooms with 30 desks and the classrooms with 25 desks.

First, we calculate the number of classrooms with 30 desks. Since one-third of the 15 classrooms have 30 desks:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ classrooms}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of desks in these 5 classrooms:
\[
5 \text{ classrooms} \times 30 \text{ desks per classroom} = 150 \text{ desks}
\]

Now, we calculate the number of classrooms with 25 desks. The rest of the classrooms have 25 desks:
\[
15 \text{ classrooms} - 5 \text{ classrooms} = 10 \text{ classrooms}
\]

Then, we calculate the total number of desks in these 10 classrooms:
\[
10 \text{ classrooms} \times 25 \text{ desks per classroom} = 250 \text{ desks}
\]

Finally, we add the total number of desks from both types of classrooms to find the total number of students that can be accommodated:
\[
150 \text{ desks} + 250 \text{ desks} = 400 \text{ desks}
\]

Since each student requires one desk, the school can accommodate 400 students.

1. First, calculate the number of classrooms that have 30 desks each:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5
   \]
   So, 5 classrooms have 30 desks each.

2. Next, calculate the number of classrooms that have 25 desks each:
   \[
   15 - 5 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 classrooms have 25 desks each.

3. To find the total number of desks, add the desks from both types of classrooms:
   \[
   5 \times 30 + 10 \times 25 = 150 + 250 = 400
   \]

4. Since each desk accommodates one student, the total number of students the school can accommodate is equal to the total number of desks:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 400
   \]

Therefore, the school can accommodate 400 students such that each student has their own desk.

First, let's determine the number of classrooms that have 30 desks and the number of classrooms that have 25 desks. One-third of the 15 classrooms are:

\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ classrooms} \]

These 5 classrooms each contain 30 desks, so the total number of desks in these classrooms is:

\[ 5 \times 30 = 150 \text{ desks} \]

The remaining classrooms are:

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ classrooms} \]

Each of these classrooms contains 25 desks, so the total number of desks in these classrooms is:

\[ 10 \times 25 = 250 \text{ desks} \]

Adding the desks from both groups, the total number of desks in the school is:
\[ 150 + 250 = 400 \text{ desks} \]

Since each student needs one desk, the school can accommodate 400 students.

The school has 15 classrooms in total. One-third of these classrooms have 30 desks each. That means there are \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) classrooms with 30 desks.

The rest of the classrooms, which is \( 15 - 5 = 10 \) classrooms, have 25 desks each.

So, the total number of desks in the school is:
\[ 5 \text{ classrooms} \times 30 \text{ desks/classroom} + 10 \text{ classrooms} \times 25 \text{ desks/classroom} \]
\[ = 150 + 250 \]
\[ = 400 \text{ desks} \]

Therefore, the school can accommodate 400 students.

First, we calculate the number of classrooms with 30 desks:
\[ \text{Number of classrooms with 30 desks} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

Each of these 5 classrooms has 30 desks, so the total number of desks in these classrooms is:

Next, we calculate the number of classrooms with 25 desks:
\[ \text{Number of classrooms with 25 desks} = 15 - 5 = 10 \]

Each of these 10 classrooms has 25 desks, so the total number of desks in these classrooms is:
\[ 10 \times 25 = 250 \]

Now, we sum the number of desks from both types of classrooms to find the total number of desks the school can accommodate:
\[ 150 + 250 = 400 \]

Therefore, the school can accommodate 400 students with their own desk.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. The school has 15 classrooms in total.
2. One-third of these classrooms have 30 desks each, so the number of these classrooms is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \).
3. The remaining two-thirds have 25 desks each, so the number of these classrooms is \( 15 - 5 = 10 \).
4. Since each student requires one desk, we need to calculate the total number of desks available and then divide by the number of students, which is equal to the number of classrooms.

So, the total number of desks is \( 5 \times 30 + 10 \times 25 \).

Let's calculate this.
</reasoning>
<answer>
<total-desks>
5 * (number-of-desks-per-classroom-at-that-level) + 10 * (number-of-desks-per-classroom-at-that-level) = (5 + 10) * (30 + 25) = 15 * 55 = 825
</total-desks>

Therefore, the school can accommodate a total of 825 students so that everyone has their own desk.
