system
Jan splits the 1000 feet of cable into 25-foot sections, so she has 1000 / 25 = 40 sections.
She gives 1/4 of that to a friend, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 sections.
She then puts half of the rest in storage, so she keeps 30 - 10 = 20 sections on hand.
Therefore, Jan keeps 20 sections * 25 feet = 500 feet of cable on hand.

Jan splits the 1000 feet of cable into 25-foot sections, so she gets 1000 / 25 = 40 sections.
She gives 1/4 of the sections to a friend, so she gives away 40 * 1/4 = 10 sections.
She gives away 10 sections, leaving her with 40 - 10 = 30 sections.
She puts half of the rest in storage, which means she puts 30 / 2 = 15 sections in storage.
She keeps the other half, which is 30 - 15 = 15 sections on hand.

system
Jan starts with 1000 feet of cable. She splits it into 25-foot sections, which means she has 1000 / 25 = 40 sections. She gives 1/4 of these sections to a friend, which means she gives away 40 * 1/4 = 10 sections. This leaves her with 40 - 10 = 30 sections. She then puts half of these sections in storage, which means she keeps 30 / 2 = 15 sections. The cable used for these 15 sections is 15 * 25 = 375 feet. Therefore, the cable she keeps on hand is 1000 - 375 = 625 feet.

#### GENERATION 10 RESPONSE ####


system
Jan splits 1000 feet of cable into 25-foot sections. To find out how many sections she gets:

\[ \frac{1000}{25} = 40 \]

So, Jan has 40 sections of cable.

She gives 1/4 of those sections to a friend. To find out how many she gives away, we calculate:

\[ 40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10 \]

So, Jan gives away 10 sections to her friend, leaving her with:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

She then puts half of the remaining sections in storage. To find out how many she puts in storage, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{2} = 15 \]

So, Jan puts 15 sections in storage, leaving her with:

\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

Therefore, she keeps 15 sections on hand.

Jan splits the 1000 feet of cable into 25-foot sections, which gives her \( \frac{1000}{25} = 40 \) sections. She gives 1/4 of these sections to a friend, which is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) sections. So, the number of sections she has left is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \). She then puts half of the remaining sections in storage, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sections. Thus, she keeps \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) sections, which means she keeps 15 * 25 = 375 feet of cable on hand.
