system
To find the total number of calories in the salad, we first need to calculate the calories from the croutons and then add them to the calories from the lettuce and cucumber.

Let's break it down:

1. The lettuce has 30 calories.
2. The cucumber has 80 calories.
3. The croutons have 20 calories each, and there are 12 of them.

First, we calculate the total calories from the croutons:
\[ 20 \text{ calories/crouton} \times 12 \text{ croutons} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we add the calories from the lettuce, cucumber, and croutons:
\[ 30 \text{ (lettuce)} + 80 \text{ (cucumber)} + 240 \text{ (croutons)} = 350 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the salad is 350 calories.

The lettuce has 30 calories. The cucumber has 80 calories. Each of the 12 croutons has 20 calories, so the total calories from the croutons are \(12 \times 20 = 240\) calories. The total calories in the salad are the sum of the calories from the lettuce, cucumber, and croutons, which is \(30 + 80 + 240 = 350\) calories.

To find the total number of calories in the salad, we need to add the calories from each component.

Lettuce: 30 calories
Cucumber: 80 calories
Croutons: 12 * 20 = 240 calories

Total calories = 30 + 80 + 240 = 350 calories

To find the total number of calories in the salad, we need to add the calories from each item.

Lettuce: 30 calories
Cucumber: 80 calories
Croutons: 12 croutons * 20 calories each = 240 calories

Total calories = 30 + 80 + 240 = 350 calories

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####

system
To find the total number of calories in the salad, we need to calculate the calories from the lettuce, the cucumber, and the croutons separately, and then add them together.

First, we calculate the calories from the lettuce:
Lettuce = 30 calories

Next, we calculate the calories from the cucumber:
Cucumber = 80 calories

Finally, we calculate the calories from the croutons:
Croutons = 12 croutons * 20 calories per crouton = 240 calories

Now, we add up all the calories:
Calories in the salad = Lettuce + Cucumber + Croutons
                  = 30 + 80 + 240
                  = 350 calories

Therefore, the total number of calories in the salad is 350 calories.

To find the total number of calories in the salad, we need to sum the calories from each ingredient. 

The calculation is as follows:
- Lettuce: 30 calories
- Cucumber: 80 calories
- Croutons: 12 croutons, each with 20 calories, which gives a total of \(12 \times 20 = 240\) calories

Adding these together: \(30 + 80 + 240 = 350\) calories.

Therefore, the salad has 350 calories in total.

The lettuce has 30 calories, the cucumber has 80 calories, and each of the 12 croutons has 20 calories, so the total number of calories in the croutons is 12 * 20 = 240 calories.

Now, adding up all the calories we get: 30 (lettuce) + 80 (cucumber) + 240 (croutons) = 350 calories.

Let's calculate the total calories step by step:

1. The lettuce has 30 calories.
2. The cucumber has 80 calories.
3. Each of the 12 croutons has 20 calories.

First, we calculate the total calories from the croutons:

\[ 12 \text{ croutons} \times 20 \text{ calories per crouton} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add the calories from the lettuce and the cucumber to the calories from the croutons:

\[ 30 \text{ calories (lettuce)} + 80 \text{ calories (cucumber)} + 240 \text{ calories (croutons)} = 350 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the salad is 350 calories.

The total calories from the croutons can be calculated by multiplying the number of croutons by the calories per crouton: 12 croutons * 20 calories/crouton = 240 calories. Adding the calories of the lettuce and cucumber gives: 30 + 80 = 110 calories. Therefore, the total calories in the salad are 110 + 240 = 350 calories.
