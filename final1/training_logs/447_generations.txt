Jar A has 28 marbles. Jar B has 12 more marbles than jar A. Jar C has twice as many marbles as jar B. How many marbles are there altogether?

#### ANS ####

148
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
First, let's find out how many marbles are in Jar B. Since Jar B has 12 more marbles than Jar A, we add 12 to the number of marbles in Jar A:

Jar B = Jar A + 12
Jar B = 28 + 12
Jar B = 40 marbles

Next, we'll calculate the number of marbles in Jar C. Since Jar C has twice as many marbles as Jar B, we multiply the number of marbles in Jar B by 2:

Jar C = 2 × Jar B
Jar C = 2 × 40
Jar C = 80 marbles

Now, to find the total number of marbles in all three jars, we add the number of marbles in each jar together:

Total marbles = Jar A + Jar B + Jar C
Total marbles = 28 + 40 + 80
Total marbles = 148

So, there are 148 marbles altogether in all three jars.

To find out how many marbles are in each jar, we'll first add 12 to the number of marbles in Jar A to find out how many marbles are in Jar B. 
Jar B has 28 + 12 = 40 marbles.
Now we need to add 12 more marbles to Jar B's amount to find out how many marbles are in Jar C. 
Jar C has 40 + 12 = 52 marbles.
Now that we know all three jars have a certain number of marbles each, we can add them all together to find out how many marbles are added in total. 
Jar A has 28 marbles, Jar B has 40 marbles, and Jar C has 52 marbles. 
28 + 40 + 52 = 110
There are 110 marbles altogether.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Jar A has 28 marbles.
2. Jar B has 12 more marbles than Jar A:
   Jar B = 28 + 12 = 40 marbles
3. Jar C has twice as many marbles as Jar B:
   Jar C = 2 * 40 = 80 marbles

Now, to find the total number of marbles:

Total = Jar A + Jar B + Jar C
Total = 28 + 40 + 80
Total = 148 marbles

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####


system
To find the total number of marbles, we need to determine the number of marbles in each jar and then sum them up.

1. Jar A has 28 marbles.
2. Jar B has 12 more marbles than Jar A. Therefore, the number of marbles in Jar B is:
   \[
   28 + 12 = 40
   \]
3. Jar C has twice as many marbles as Jar B. Therefore, the number of marbles in Jar C is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

Now, we sum the marbles from all three jars:
\[
28 + 40 + 80 = 148
\]

Thus, the total number of marbles is \(148\).

To find out how many marbles are in each jar, we start with the information given:

Jar A contains 28 marbles.

Jar B has 12 more marbles than Jar A, so:

Jar B = Jar A + 12
Jar B = 28 + 12
Jar B = 40 marbles

Jar C has twice as many marbles as Jar B, so:

Jar C = 2 * Jar B
Jar C = 2 * 40
Jar C = 80 marbles

Now, to find out how many marbles there are altogether in all the jars, we add the number of marbles in each jar together:

Total marbles = Jar A + Jar B + Jar C

To find out how many marbles are there altogether, let's calculate the number of marbles in each jar:

- Jar A has 28 marbles.
- Jar B has 12 more marbles than Jar A, so it has \(28 + 12 = 40\) marbles.
- Jar C has twice as many marbles as Jar B, so it has \(40 \times 2 = 80\) marbles.

Now, add the numbers to find the total:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Jar A} + \text{Jar B} + \text{Jar C} \]

\[ \text{Total marbles} = 28 + 40 + 80 \]

To find the total number of marbles, we:

1. Determine the number of marbles in Jar B.
Since Jar B has 12 more marbles than Jar A, and Jar A has 28 marbles, then Jar B has:
   28 (Jar A) + 12 = 40 marbles.
   
2. Calculate the number of marbles in Jar C.
Jar C has twice as many marbles as Jar B, so:
   40 (Jar B) * 2 = 80 marbles.
   
3. Add up all the marbles.
Jar A: 28, Jar B: 40, Jar C: 80. Altogether there are:
   28 + 40 + 80 = 148 marbles.
