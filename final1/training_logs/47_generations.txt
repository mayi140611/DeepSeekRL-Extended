To calculate the total time taken to download the entire file, we need to consider the time taken for each segment of the download.

For the first 60 megabytes, the download rate is 5 megabytes per second. So, the time taken for the first 60 megabytes is distance divided by speed: 
\[ \text{Time for first 60 MB} = \frac{60 \text{ MB}}{5 \text{ MB/s}} = 12 \text{ seconds} \]

For the remaining part of the file, which is the total size minus the first 60 megabytes, we have:
\[ \text{Remaining part} = 90 \text{ MB} - 60 \text{ MB} = 30 \text{ MB} \]

The remaining part is downloaded at a rate of 10 megabytes per second. Therefore, the time taken for the remaining part is:
\[ \text{Time for remaining part} = \frac{30 \text{ MB}}{10 \text{ MB/s}} = 3 \text{ seconds} \]

Adding these two times together gives the total download time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 12 \text{ seconds} + 3 \text{ seconds} = 15 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time to download the entire file is 15 seconds.

First, we need to calculate the time it takes for the file to download its first 60 megabytes. Given the download rate of 5 megabytes per second for the first 60 megabytes, the time required is:

\[
\text{Time for the first 60 megabytes} = \frac{60 \text{ megabytes}}{5 \text{ megabytes/second}} = 12 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the remaining size of the file after the first 60 megabytes have been downloaded:

\[
\text{Remaining size} = 90 \text{ megabytes} - 60 \text{ megabytes} = 30 \text{ megabytes}
\]

The download rate after the first 60 megabytes is 10 megabytes per second. Therefore, the time required to download the remaining 30 megabytes is:

\[
\text{Time for the remaining 30 megabytes} = \frac{30 \text{ megabytes}}{10 \text{ megabytes/second}} = 3 \text{ seconds}
\]

The total time required to download the entire file is the sum of the time taken for the first 60 megabytes and the time taken for the remaining 30 megabytes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 12 \text{ seconds} + 3 \text{ seconds} = 15 \text{ seconds}
\]

Hence, the file downloads entirely after \boxed{15} seconds.

To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time taken for the first 60 megabytes and the time taken for the remaining 30 megabytes separately, and then sum the two times.

First, the time taken to download the first 60 megabytes at a rate of 5 megabytes per second is calculated as:
\[
\text{Time for first 60 MB} = \frac{60 \text{ MB}}{5 \text{ MB/s}} = 12 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, the time taken to download the remaining 30 megabytes at a rate of 10 megabytes per second is calculated as:
\[
\text{Time for remaining 30 MB} = \frac{30 \text{ MB}}{10 \text{ MB/s}} = 3 \text{ seconds}
\]

Adding these two times together, the total time to download the entire file is:
\[
\text{Total time} = 12 \text{ seconds} + 3 \text{ seconds} = 15 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the file takes \boxed{15} seconds to download entirely.

To determine how long it takes to download the entire file, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on the given download rates and the sizes of the files.

1. **First 60 Megabytes:**
   - Download rate for this part is 5 megabytes per second.
   - Time taken to download the first 60 megabytes:
     \[
     \text{Time}_1 = \frac{\text{Size}_1}{\text{Rate}_1} = \frac{60 \text{ MB}}{5 \text{ MB/s}} = 12 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Remaining File:**
   - Size of the file after the first 60 megabytes is 90 megabytes - 60 megabytes = 30 megabytes.
   - Download rate for this remaining file is 10 megabytes per second.
   - Time taken to download the remaining 30 megabytes:
     \[
     \text{Time}_2 = \frac{\text{Size}_2}{\text{Rate}_2} = \frac{30 \text{ MB}}{10 \text{ MB/s}} = 3 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time to download the entire file:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 12 \text{ seconds} + 3 \text{ seconds} = 15 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Therefore, it takes 15 seconds to download the entire file.

To determine how long it takes to download the file completely, we need to break down the process into two parts: the first 60 megabytes and the remaining 30 megabytes.

1. **First 60 megabytes**: The file initially downloads at a rate of 5 megabytes per second.
   \[
   \text{Time for first 60 MB} = \frac{60 \text{ MB}}{5 \text{ MB/s}} = 12 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Remaining 30 megabytes**: After the first 60 megabytes, the file downloads at a rate of 10 megabytes per second.
   \[
   \text{Time for next 30 MB} = \frac{30 \text{ MB}}{10 \text{ MB/s}} = 3 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Total time**: The total time to download the entire file is the sum of the time for the first 60 megabytes and the time for the next 30 megabytes.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 12 \text{ seconds} + 3 \text{ seconds} = 15 \text{ seconds}

To determine how long it takes to download the entire 90 megabytes, we will break the process into two phases based on the different download rates.

Phase 1:
The first 60 megabytes are downloaded at a rate of 5 megabytes per second.

To calculate the time for this phase:
\[ \text{Time}_1 = \frac{\text{Total bytes}_1}{\text{Rate}_1} = \frac{60\ \text{MB}}{5\ \text{MB/s}} = 12\ \text{seconds} \]

Phase 2:
After the first 60 megabytes, an additional 30 megabytes need to be downloaded at a rate of 10 megabytes per second.

To calculate the time for this phase:
\[ \text{Time}_2 = \frac{\text{Total bytes}_2}{\text{Rate}_2} = \frac{30\ \text{MB}}{10\ \text{MB/s}} = 3\ \text{seconds} \]

To find the total download time, we add the times from both phases:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 12\ \text{seconds} + 3\ \text{seconds} = 15\ \text{seconds} \]

Therefore, the file will take 15 seconds to download entirely.

To find the total time taken to download the entire file, we first divide the file into two parts: the first part that downloads at a rate of 5 megabytes per second, and the second part that downloads at a rate of 10 megabytes per second.

The first part, which is 60 megabytes, will take 60 seconds to download because 60 megabytes divided by 5 megabytes per second is 12 seconds.

The second part is the remaining 30 megabytes of the file, and it will take 30 megabytes divided by 10 megabytes per second, which is 3 seconds.

To find the total time, we add the time for each part:

60 seconds (for the first part) + 3 seconds (for the second part) = 63 seconds

Therefore, it takes a total of 63 seconds to download the entire file.

To determine the total time it takes to download the 90 megabytes, we'll break down the process as follows:

First, calculate the time taken to download the first 60 megabytes:
- Rate: 5 megabytes per second
- Size: 60 megabytes

Time for the first 60 megabytes = \( \frac{60}{5} = 12 \) seconds

Next, calculate the remaining size to download:
- Total size: 90 megabytes
- Downloaded size: 60 megabytes
- Remaining size: \( 90 - 60 = 30 \) megabytes

Then, calculate the time taken to download the remaining 30 megabytes:
- Rate: 10 megabytes per second
- Size: 30 megabytes

Time for the remaining 30 megabytes = \( \frac{30}{10} = 3 \) seconds

Finally, sum the times for both segments to find the total time to download the entire file:
Total time = Time for the first 60 megabytes + Time for the remaining 30 megabytes
Total time = 12 seconds + 3 seconds
Total time = 15 seconds

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the entire file is 15 seconds.

   - After the first 60 megabytes, the remaining data is 30 megabytes.
   - The download rate for the remaining 30 megabytes is 10 megabytes per second.
   - Time = Total data / Rate
   - Time = 30 MB / 10 MB/s = 3 seconds

3. **Total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = Time for first 60 megabytes + Time for remaining 30 megabytes

To calculate the total time taken to download the file, we need to break down the download into two parts: the first 60 megabytes and the remaining part of the file that downloads at a rate of 10 megabytes per second.

For the first 60 megabytes, the download rate is 5 megabytes per second. Since he downloaded 60 megabytes at this rate, we can find the time taken for this part of the download by dividing the total size of the first part by the download rate:

Time for first 60 MB = Size of first part / Download rate
Time for first 60 MB = 60 MB / 5 MB/second
Time for first 60 MB = 12 seconds

For the remaining part of the file that downloads at a rate of 10 megabytes per second, the size of this part is:

Size of remaining part = Total size - Size of first part
Size of remaining part = 90 MB - 60 MB
Size of remaining part = 30 MB

Since the download rate is 10 MB per second, the time taken for this part of the download is:

Time for remaining part = Size of remaining part / Download rate
Time for remaining part = 30 MB / 10 MB/second
Time for remaining part = 3 seconds

Now, we add the time taken for both parts of the download:

Total time = Time for first 60 MB + Time for remaining part
Total time = 12 seconds + 3 seconds
Total time = 15 seconds

Therefore, it takes 15 seconds in total to download the completely file.

For the first 60 megabytes, the file downloads at a rate of 5 megabytes per second. So, the time taken to download this portion is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{first 60 MB}} = \frac{60 \text{ MB}}{5 \text{ MB/s}} = 12 \text{ seconds} \]

For the remaining \(90 - 60 = 30\) MB, the file downloads at a rate of 10 MB per second. So, the time taken to download this portion is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{remaining 30 MB}} = \frac{30 \text{ MB}}{10 \text{ MB/s}} = 3 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we add both times together to find the total time to download the entire file:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{first 60 MB}} + \text{Time}_{\text{remaining 30 MB}} \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the initial download and the remaining download.

1. **Initial Download (0-60 MB):** 
   - Download rate: 5 MB/s
   - Time required to download the first 60 MB: \(\frac{60 \text{ MB}}{5 \text{ MB/s}} = 12 \text{ seconds}\)

2. **Remaining Download (60+ MB):** 
   - Download rate: 10 MB/s
   - Remaining size to download: \(90 \text{ MB} - 60 \text{ MB} = 30 \text{ MB}\)
   - Time required to download the remaining 30 MB: \(\frac{30 \text{ MB}}{10 \text{ MB/s}} = 3 \text{ seconds}\)

Total time to download the entire file:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for initial download} + \text{Time for remaining download} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 12 \text{ seconds} + 3 \text{ seconds} = 15 \text{ seconds} \]

1. **First 60 megabytes**: The download rate is 5 megabytes per second. So, the time taken to download the first 60 megabytes is \( \frac{60 \text{ MB}}{5 \text{ MB/s}} = 12 \text{ seconds} \).

2. **Remaining 30 megabytes**: After the first 60 megabytes, the file has a total size of 90 megabytes. The remaining size to be downloaded is 30 megabytes. The download rate increases to 10 megabytes per second for the remaining part.

   So, the time taken to download the remaining 30 megabytes is \( \frac{30 \text{ MB}}{10 \text{ MB/s}} = 3 \text{ seconds} \).

Adding these two times together gives the total time taken to download the entire file:
