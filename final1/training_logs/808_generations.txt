###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Tabitha and her friends were excited to go to the Christmas parade because they knew candy would be thrown to the crowd from the floats.  Tabitha caught 22 pieces of candy.  Stan caught 13 pieces.  Julie caught half the amount of candy as Tabitha caught and Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan.  How many pieces in total did the friends catch?

To find the total number of pieces of candy caught by Tabitha, Stan, Julie, and Carlos, we will calculate the amount each person caught and then sum them up.

1. Tabitha caught 22 pieces of candy.
2. Stan caught 13 pieces of candy.
3. Julie caught half the amount of candy as Tabitha. So, Julie caught \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) pieces of candy.
4. Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan. So, Carlos caught \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \) pieces of candy.

Now, we sum the pieces of candy caught by all four friends:

- Tabitha: 22
- Stan: 13
- Julie: 11
- Carlos: 26

Total pieces of candy = \( 22 + 13 + 11 + 26 \).

To find the total, we add these numbers up.

\[
22 + 13 = 35
\]
\[
35 + 11 = 46
\]
\[
46 + 26 = 72
\]

Therefore, the friends caught a total of 72 pieces of candy.

First, we need to determine the amount of candy caught by each person involved in the problem.

1. **Tabitha:** Tabitha caught 22 pieces of candy.
2. **Stan:** Stan caught 13 pieces of candy.
3. **Julie:** Julie caught half the amount of candy as Tabitha. Since Tabitha caught 22 pieces, Julie caught \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) pieces.
4. **Carlos:** Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan. Since Stan caught 13 pieces, Carlos caught \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \) pieces.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pieces of candy caught by the group by summing all the candy caught by each person:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total pieces of candy} &= \text{Tabitha's candy} + \text{Stan's candy} + \text{Julie's candy} + \text{Carlos's candy} \\
&= 22 + 13 + 11 + 26 \\
&= 72

Therefore, the total number of pieces of candy caught by the friends is 72.
