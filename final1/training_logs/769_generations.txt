Amoli drove 42 miles an hour for 3 hours, so she traveled:
\[ 42 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 126 \text{ miles} \]

Anayet drove 61 miles an hour for 2 hours, so he traveled:
\[ 61 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 122 \text{ miles} \]

Together, they have traveled:
\[ 126 \text{ miles} + 122 \text{ miles} = 248 \text{ miles} \]

They need to travel a total of 369 miles, so the total distance remaining is:
\[ 369 \text{ miles} - 248 \text{ miles} = 121 \text{ miles} \]

First, let's calculate the total distance Amoli traveled. Amoli drove at a speed of 42 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, the distance Amoli traveled is:
\[ 42 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 126 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Anayet traveled. Anayet drove at a speed of 61 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance Anayet traveled is:
\[ 61 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 122 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's add the distances traveled by Amoli and Anayet to find the total distance they have already covered:
\[ 126 \text{ miles} + 122 \text{ miles} = 248 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance they need to travel is 369 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance they still need to travel is:
\[ 369 \text{ miles} - 248 \text{ miles} = 121 \text{ miles} \]

So, they still need to travel 121 miles.

To find out how many miles Amoli and Anayet still need to travel, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them has traveled and then find the difference between their total distance traveled and the total distance they must travel.

Amoli's distance:
\[ 42 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 126 \text{ miles} \]

Anayet's distance:
\[ 61 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 122 \text{ miles} \]

Combined distance traveled:
\[ 126 \text{ miles} + 122 \text{ miles} = 248 \text{ miles} \]

Total distance to be traveled:
\[ 369 \text{ miles} \]

So, the remaining distance they need to travel is:
\[ 369 \text{ miles} - 248 \text{ miles} = 121 \text{ miles} \]

To determine how many miles Amoli and Anayet still need to travel, we first need to calculate the distance each of them has already traveled.

Amoli's distance:
\[ \text{Speed of Amoli} = 42 \text{ miles/hour} \]
\[ \text{Time driven by Amoli} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance driven by Amoli} = 42 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 126 \text{ miles} \]

Anayet's distance:
\[ \text{Speed of Anayet} = 61 \text{ miles/hour} \]
\[ \text{Time driven by Anayet} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance driven by Anayet} = 61 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 122 \text{ miles} \]

Total distance traveled by both:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven by Amoli} + \text{Distance driven by Anayet} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 126 \text{ miles} + 122 \text{ miles} = 248 \text{ miles} \]

Total distance they need to travel:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 369 \text{ miles} \]

Distance left to travel:
\[ \text{Distance left to travel} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Total distance driven} \]
\[ \text{Distance left to travel} = 369 \text{ miles} - 248 \text{ miles} = 121 \text{ miles} \]

So, they still need to travel 121 miles.

Amoli drove 42 miles an hour for 3 hours, so she covered a distance of 42 * 3 = 126 miles. Anayet drove at 61 miles an hour for 2 hours, so he covered a distance of 61 * 2 = 122 miles. Together, they covered a distance of 126 + 122 = 248 miles. Therefore, they still need to travel 369 - 248 = 121 miles.

First, we calculate the distance Amoli traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Amoli's distance = 42 miles/hour * 3 hours = 126 miles

Next, we calculate the distance Anayet traveled:
Anayet's distance = 61 miles/hour * 2 hours = 122 miles

Now, we sum the distances traveled by both Amoli and Anayet:
Total distance travelled = Amoli's distance + Anayet's distance
Total distance travelled = 126 miles + 122 miles = 248 miles

Finally, we subtract the total distance travelled from the total distance they need to travel to find the remaining distance:
Remaining distance = Total distance - Total distance travelled
Remaining distance = 369 miles - 248 miles = 121 miles

Therefore, they still need to travel 121 miles.

First, let's calculate the distance Amoli drove. We know Amoli drove 42 miles per hour for 3 hours, so the distance Amoli drove is:
\[ 42 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 126 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Anayet drove. We know Anayet drove 61 miles per hour for 2 hours, so the distance Anayet drove is:
\[ 61 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 122 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add the distances they drove together to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 126 \, \text{miles} + 122 \, \text{miles} = 248 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, let's subtract the total distance traveled from the total distance to be traveled to find the distance they still need to travel:
\[ 369 \, \text{miles} - 248 \, \text{miles} = 121 \, \text{miles} \]

So, they still need to travel 121 miles.

To determine how many miles Amoli and Anayet still need to travel, we can calculate the distance each of them has already traveled and then subtract that from the total distance of 369 miles.

First, calculate the distance Amoli traveled:
\[ 42 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 126 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the distance Anayet traveled:
\[ 61 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 122 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, add the distances traveled by Amoli and Anayet to find the total distance they have covered so far:
\[ 126 \, \text{miles} + 122 \, \text{miles} = 248 \, \text{miles} \]

Subtract the total distance covered from the total distance of 369 miles to find the remaining distance they need to travel:
\[ 369 \, \text{miles} - 248 \, \text{miles} = 121 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles they still need to travel is \( \boxed{121} \).

To find out how many miles Amoli and Anayet still need to travel, we can first calculate the distance each of them has already traveled and then subtract that from the total distance to be traveled.

Anayet's distance: Anayet drove at 61 miles an hour for 2 hours, so he covered \(61 \times 2 = 122\) miles.

The total distance already traveled by both of them is \(126 + 122 = 248\) miles.

The total distance they need to travel together is 369 miles. So, the distance they still need to travel is \(369 - 248 = 121\) miles.
