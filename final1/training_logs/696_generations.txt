<reasoning>
Let's denote the cost of one brown sock as \( B \) cents. According to the problem, two white socks cost 45 cents more than one brown sock. Therefore, the cost of two white socks, which is 100 cents, is equal to \( B + 45 \) cents. We can set up the equation:
\[ 2B = 100 - 45 \]
\[ 2B = 55 \]
\[ B = \frac{55}{2} \]
\[ B = 27.5 \text{ cents} \]

So, one brown sock costs 27.5 cents.

Next, we need to find out how much 15 brown socks would cost. Since one brown sock costs 27.5 cents, 15 brown socks would cost:
\[ 15 \times 27.5 = 412.5 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's convert this amount to dollars:
\[ 412.5 \times 0.01 = 4.125 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for 15 brown socks is 4.125 dollars.

Let's denote the cost of a brown sock as \( x \) cents.

From the problem, we know that two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. Since two white socks cost 45 cents, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x = 45 + 25 \]
\[ 2x = 70 \]
\[ x = 35 \]

So, the cost of a brown sock is 35 cents.

Now, we need to find out how much 15 brown socks cost. Since each brown sock costs 35 cents, the total cost for 15 brown socks is:
\[ 15 \times 35 = 525 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the total cost for 15 brown socks is 525 cents.

Let's denote the cost of one brown sock as \( x \) cents. According to the information given, two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. Since two white socks cost 45 cents, we can write the equation:
\[ 2 \times 45 = x + 25 \]

Solving this equation for \( x \):
\[ 90 = x + 25 \]
\[ x = 65 \]

So, one brown sock costs 65 cents.

Now, to find the cost of 15 brown socks, we multiply the cost of one brown sock by 15:
\[ 65 \times 15 = 975 \text{ cents} \]

Since 975 cents is the same as 9.75 dollars, the cost for 15 brown socks is 9.75 dollars.

First, we determine the cost of a single brown sock. According to the information given, two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. If two white socks cost 45 cents, then the cost of a single brown sock is:
\[ 45 \text{ cents} - 25 \text{ cents} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 15 brown socks. Since one brown sock costs 20 cents, the cost for 15 brown socks is:
\[ 15 \times 20 \text{ cents} = 300 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the cost for 15 brown socks is 300 cents, which is equivalent to $3.00.

Let's denote the cost of a single brown sock as \( B \) cents.

We are given that two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. The cost of two white socks is 45 cents. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

\[ 2B = 45 + 25 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ 2B = 70 \]
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} \]
\[ B = 35 \]

So, a single brown sock costs 35 cents.

To find out how much 15 brown socks would cost, we multiply the cost of one brown sock by 15:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 brown socks} = 15 \times 35 = 525 \text{ cents} \]

Converting to dollars:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 brown socks} = \frac{525}{100} = 5.25 \text{ dollars} \]

So, 15 brown socks would cost 5.25 dollars.

To determine the cost of one brown sock, we start by identifying the cost of a white sock. We know that two white socks cost 45 cents. Therefore, the cost of one white sock is:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ cents}}{2} = 22.5 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of a brown sock, which is 25 cents less than the cost of one white sock. Therefore, the cost of one brown sock is:
\[ 22.5 \text{ cents} - 25 \text{ cents} = -2.5 \text{ cents} \]

This calculation seems incorrect because the cost of a brown sock cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The problem states that two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. Let the cost of a brown sock be \( b \) cents. Then, the cost of two white socks would be \( 2b + 25 \) cents. We know this equals 45 cents, so we have:
\[ 2b + 25 = 45 \]

Solving for \( b \):
\[ 2b = 45 - 25 \]
\[ 2b = 20 \]
\[ b = 10 \]

So, the cost of one brown sock is 10 cents. To find the cost of 15 brown socks, we multiply the cost of one brown sock by 15:
\[ 10 \text{ cents} \times 15 = 150 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of 15 brown socks is 150 cents, or $1.50.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1.50} \]

Given that two white socks cost 45 cents and that a pair of white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock, we can start by finding the cost of one white sock.

Since two white socks cost 45 cents, the cost of one white sock (W) would be:
\[ 45/2 = 22.5 \text{ cents} \]

Given that a pair of white socks costs 25 cents more than a single brown sock, we can say that:
\[ 22.5 = \text{cost of one brown sock} + 25 \]
\[ \text{cost of one brown sock} = 22.5 - 25 = -2.5 \]

Clearly, there is an error in the logic. Let's correct this by calculating directly with the information given:
\[ \text{Cost of one white sock} = \text{Cost of one pair of white socks} - 25 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one white sock} = 45 - 25 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Since each white sock costs 20 cents:
\[ \text{Cost of 15 brown socks} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ cents} \]

Let's denote the cost of the brown sock as \( B \) cents. We know two things:
1. Two white socks cost 45 cents.
2. Two white socks cost 25 cents more than a brown sock.

From the second piece of information, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45 = B + 25 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 45 - 25 = 20 \]

So, the brown sock costs 20 cents.

Now, to find out how much you would pay for 15 brown socks, we simply multiply the cost of one brown sock by 15:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, 300 cents is equal to 3 dollars.

Therefore, the cost for 15 brown socks is 3 dollars.

Let's define the cost of a single brown sock as \( x \) cents.

According to the problem, two white socks cost 25 cents more than one brown sock. If two white socks cost 45 cents, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2 \times 45 = x + 25 \]

Simplifying this equation gives us:

\[ 90 = x + 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 90 - 25 \]
\[ x = 65 \]

So, one brown sock costs 65 cents.

If you pay for 15 brown socks, the total cost would be:

\[ 15 \times 65 = 975 \text{ cents} \]

Let's denote the cost of a brown sock as \( B \) cents. According to the problem, two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. Since two white socks cost 45 cents, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2 \times (B + 25) = 45 \]

Expanding and solving for \( B \):
\[ 2B + 50 = 45 \]
\[ 2B = 45 - 50 \]
\[ 2B = -5 \]

This result is not possible because the cost of a sock cannot be negative. There seems to be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The correct interpretation should be that the cost of two white socks is 70 cents, not 45 cents, because:
\[ 2 \times (B + 25) = 70 \]

\[ 2B + 50 = 70 \]
\[ 2B = 70 - 50 \]
\[ 2B = 20 \]
\[ B = 10 \]

So, a single brown sock costs 10 cents. Now, to find out how much it would cost to buy 15 brown socks:
\[ 15 \times 10 = 150 \]

Therefore, the cost for 15 brown socks is 150 cents, or $1.50.

Let's denote the cost of a single brown sock as \( B \) cents.

According to the problem, two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. Since two white socks cost 45 cents, we can write the following equation:

\[ 25 = B + 45 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 25 - 45 \]
\[ B = -20 \]

The cost of a single brown sock is -20 cents. However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as socks can't have a negative cost. It seems there might be a mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck the initial information.

Given that 2 white socks cost 45 cents, we should calculate the actual cost of a single white sock. Therefore, if two white socks cost 45 cents, a single white sock would cost:

\[ 45 / 2 = 22.5 \text{ cents} \]

So, two white socks cost 25 cents more than a brown sock, which means:

\[ 22.5 + 25 = 47.5 \text{ cents} \]

Now, if a brown sock costs 47.5 cents, the cost of 15 brown socks would be:

\[ 15 \times 47.5 = 712.5 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the total cost for 15 brown socks would be 712.5 cents.

Reasoning:
1. We know that two white socks cost 45 cents.
2. We also know that two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock.
3. So, a single brown sock costs 45 cents - 25 cents = 20 cents.
4. If one brown sock costs 20 cents, then 15 brown socks would cost 15 * 20 cents = 300 cents.
5. Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, 300 cents would be 300 / 100 = 3 dollars.

Therefore, the answer is 3 dollars.

Let's denote the cost of a single brown sock as \( B \) cents.

We know:
1. Two white socks cost 45 cents.
2. Two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock, which can be written as:
\[ 2W = B + 25 \]
where \( W \) is the cost of one white sock.

Since two white socks cost 45 cents, one white sock costs:
\[ W = \frac{45}{2} = 22.5 \text{ cents} \]

Now we can find the cost of a single brown sock:
\[ 22.5 = B + 25 \]
\[ B = 22.5 - 25 = -2.5 \]

It seems there might be an error in the calculation or the given conditions. Let's recheck the information provided:

If two white socks cost 45 cents, and they are 25 cents more than a brown sock, let's correct the calculation:
\[ B = 22.5 - 25 = -2.5 \]

Since the cost cannot be negative, let's assume the correct interpretation is that two white socks cost 45 cents, which is 25 cents more than A brown sock:
\[ 22.5 = B + 25 \]
\[ B = 22.5 - 25 = -2.5 \]

This clearly indicates an error. The correct price should be positive if interpreted correctly. Let's recheck:
\[ B = 22.5 - 25 = -2.5 \]

The correct interpretation should be:
\[ B = 22.5 - 25 = -2.5 \]

Therefore, the cost of a single brown sock is 22.5 cents.

Now, if you buy 15 brown socks:
\[ 15 \times 22.5 = 337.5 \]

So, the amount you would pay for 15 brown socks is 337.5 cents or 3.375 dollars.
