###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A plumber is trying to decide which of three different jobs he should take to make the most money.  The first job involves fixing three toilets and three sinks at an apartment complex.  The second involves two toilets and five sinks at a different apartment complex.  The third involves fixing one toilet, two showers and three sinks at a third apartment complex.  If the plumber charges $30 to fix a sink, $40 to fix a shower and $50 to fix a toilet, what is the most money the plumber can earn if he can only choose one of these three jobs?

To determine which job will earn the most money, we need to calculate the total earnings for each job based on the given hourly rates for fixing toilets, sinks, and showers.

For the first job:
- Fixing three toilets: 3 * $50 = $150
- Fixing three sinks: 3 * $30 = $90
- Sum: $150 + $90 = $240

For the second job:
- Fixing two toilets: 2 * $50 = $100
- Fixing five sinks: 5 * $30 = $150
- Sum: $100 + $150 = $250

For the third job:
- Fixing one toilet: 1 * $50 = $50
- Fixing two showers: 2 * $40 = $80
- Fixing three sinks: 3 * $30 = $90
- Sum: $50 + $80 + $90 = $220

Comparing the totals for each job:
- First job: $240
- Second job: $250
- Third job: $220

The most money the plumber can earn is $250 for the second job.

To determine which job will earn the plumber the most money, we need to calculate the total cost for each job. The charges are $30 for a sink, $40 for a shower, and $50 for a toilet.

**Job 1: Fixing three toilets and three sinks**
- Cost for three toilets: \(3 \times 50 = 150\) dollars
- Cost for three sinks: \(3 \times 30 = 90\) dollars
- Total cost for Job 1: \(150 + 90 = 240\) dollars

**Job 2: Fixing two toilets and five sinks**
- Cost for two toilets: \(2 \times 50 = 100\) dollars
- Cost for five sinks: \(5 \times 30 = 150\) dollars
- Total cost for Job 2: \(100 + 150 = 250\) dollars

**Job 3: Fixing one toilet, two showers, and three sinks**
- Cost for one toilet: \(1 \times 50 = 50\) dollars
- Cost for two showers: \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dollars
- Cost for three sinks: \(3 \times 30 = 90\) dollars
- Total cost for Job 3: \(50 + 80 + 90 = 220\) dollars

Comparing the total costs of the three jobs:
- Job 1: $240
- Job 2: $250
- Job 3: $220

The most money the plumber can earn is from Job 3, which yields a total cost of $220.

To determine which job will yield the most money for the plumber, we need to calculate the total earnings for each job. The costs of fixing toilets, sinks, and showers are given, along with the number of each fixture to be repaired in each job.

Let's denote:
- T for the cost to fix a toilet, which is $50.
- S for the cost to fix a sink, which is $30.
- H for the cost to fix a shower, which is $40.

For the first job, the plumber will fix three toilets and three sinks:
- Income from fixing toilets: \(3T = 3 \times 50 = 150\)
- Income from fixing sinks: \(3S = 3 \times 30 = 90\)
- Total income for the first job: \(150 + 90 = 240\)

For the second job, the plumber will fix two toilets and five sinks:
- Income from fixing toilets: \(2T = 2 \times 50 = 100\)
- Income from fixing sinks: \(5S = 5 \times 30 = 150\)
- Total income for the second job: \(100 + 150 = 250\)

For the third job, the plumber will fix one toilet, two showers, and three sinks:
- Income from fixing toilets: \(1T = 1 \times 50 = 50\)
- Income from fixing showers: \(2H = 2 \times 40 = 80\)
- Income from fixing sinks: \(3S = 3 \times 30 = 90\)
- Total income for the third job: \(50 + 80 + 90 = 220\)

Comparing the total incomes from all three jobs, we have:
- First job: $240
- Second job: $250
- Third job: $220

Therefore, the most money the plumber can earn is from the second job.
