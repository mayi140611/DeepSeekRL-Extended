Jack is running a bake sale to help pay for his basketball team's uniforms. He's already sold 4 brownies for $3 each and 5 lemon squares for $2 each. If Jack's goal is to make $50 and he sells cookies for $4 each, how many cookies does he need to sell to reach his goal?

Jack has already made from selling brownies:

4 brownies * $3/brownie = $12

He has made from selling lemon squares:

5 lemon squares * $2/square = $10

Total revenue from brownies and lemon squares:

$12 + $10 = $22

To reach his goal of $50, he needs to earn an additional:

$50 - $22 = $28

Jack sells cookies for $4 each, so the number of cookies he needs to sell to earn the additional $28 is:

$28 / $4/cookie = 7 cookies

Jack has already made an additional amount from the brownies and lemon squares:
- From the brownies: \(4 \times 3 = 12\) dollars
- From the lemon squares: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars
Therefore, he has made \(12 + 10 = 22\) dollars from the brownies and lemon squares.

His goal is to earn \(50\) dollars. Hence, the additional amount he needs to earn to meet his goal is \(50 - 22 = 28\) dollars.

If Jack sells cookies for \(4\) dollars each, then he needs to sell \(28 / 4 = 7\) cookies.

Jack has already made money from selling brownies and lemon squares. He sold 4 brownies at $3 each, which amounts to \(4 \times 3 = 12\) dollars. He also sold 5 lemon squares at $2 each, which amounts to \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars. So, he has already earned \(12 + 10 = 22\) dollars.

To reach his goal of $50, Jack needs to earn \(50 - 22 = 28\) dollars from selling cookies.

Since he sells cookies for $4 each, to earn $28 he needs to sell \(28 \div 4 = 7\) cookies.

First, we calculate how much money Jack has made from the brownies and lemon squares. He sold 4 brownies for $3 each and 5 lemon squares for $2 each.

For the brownies:
\(4 \times $3 = $12\)

For the lemon squares:
\(5 \times $2 = $10\)

Now, we add the amounts made from brownies and lemon squares:
\$12 + \$10 = \$22

Jack's goal is to make $50. We subtract the amount he has already earned from his goal to find out how much more he needs to earn:
\$50 - \$22 = \$28

Jack sells cookies for $4 each. To find out how many cookies he needs to sell to reach his goal of $28, we divide the remaining amount he needs by the price of each cookie:
\$28 รท $4 = 7

So, Jack needs to sell 7 cookies to reach his goal.

Jack has sold 4 brownies x $3/brownie = $12 worth of brownies.
Jack has sold 5 lemon squares x $2/lemon square = $10 worth of lemon squares.
Jack has made a total of $12 + $10 = $22.
Jack still needs to make $50 - $22 = $28 from cookies.
So Jack needs to sell $28 / $4 = 7 cookies to reach his goal.
