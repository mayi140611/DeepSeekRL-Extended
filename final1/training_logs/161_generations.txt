To find out how much money is left for managing public spaces, we first need to calculate how much is allocated to policing.

First, the town's annual budget totals $32 million. Half of this budget goes towards policing, so we calculate half of $32 million:

\(32 \text{ million} \div 2 = 16 \text{ million}\)

This $16 million goes towards policing.

Next, we subtract the money allocated to policing and education from the total budget to find out how much is left for managing public spaces:

\(32 \text{ million} - 16 \text{ million} - 12 \text{ million} = 4 \text{ million}\)

So, there is $4 million left for managing public spaces, as the answer is 4 million.

To find out how much money is left for managing public spaces, we need to start with the total budget and subtract the amounts allocated to policing and education.

1. Total budget: $32 million
2. Amount for policing: $32 million / 2 = $16 million
3. Amount for education: $12 million

Now, let's subtract the amounts for policing and education from the total budget to find out how much remains for managing public spaces.

\[ \text{Money for managing public spaces} = \text{Total budget} - (\text{Amount for policing} + \text{Amount for education}) \]
\[ \text{Money for managing public spaces} = $32 million - ($16 million + $12 million) \]
\[ \text{Money for managing public spaces} = $32 million - $28 million \]
\[ \text{Money for managing public spaces} = $4 million \]

The total budget is $32 million. Half of the budget goes towards policing, which is $32 million / 2 = $16 million. $12 million goes towards education. So the total amount allocated for policing and education is $16 million + $12 million = $28 million. therefore, the remaining amount for managing public spaces is $32 million - $28 million = $4 million.

The town's annual budget is $32 million.
Half of the budget goes towards policing, so $32 million / 2 = $16 million is allocated for policing.
$12 million out of the $32 million budget is dedicated to education.

Subtracting the police and education allocations from the total budget:

$32 million - $16 million - $12 million = $4 million.

This $4 million is left for managing public spaces.

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####

To find out how much money is left for managing public spaces, we need to first calculate the amount of money allocated to policing and then subtract that and the amount allocated to education from the total budget.

1. The total budget is $32 million.
2. Half of this budget goes towards policing, so that's \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) million dollars.
3. $12 million goes towards education.

Now we add the amount allocated to policing and education to find the total amount spent:
\( 16 \) (police) + \( 12 \) (education) = \( 28 \) million dollars.

Finally, subtract the total amount spent from the total budget to find the amount left for managing public spaces:
\( 32 \) (total budget) - \( 28 \) (spent) = \( 4 \) million dollars.

The total budget of the town is $32 million. Half of this budget goes towards policing, which would be:

\[ 32 \, \text{million} \times \frac{1}{2} = 16 \, \text{million} \text{ for policing} \]

$12 is already allocated to education. So, subtract the amount for policing and education from the total budget:

\[ 32 \, \text{million} - 16 \, \text{million} - 12 \, \text{million} = 4 \, \text{million} \]

There is $4 million left for managing public spaces.

system
To find out how much money is left for managing public spaces, we need to start by determining how much goes towards policing. Since half of the budget goes towards policing, we can calculate this by dividing the total budget by 2. Then, we subtract the amount going towards policing and education from the total budget. Let's do the calculation.

The calculation is:

\[ \text{Amount for policing} = \frac{\text{Total budget}}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

\[ \text{Total spent} = \text{Amount for policing} + \text{Amount for education} = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

\[ \text{Amount left for public spaces} = \text{Total budget} - \text{Total spent} = 32 - 28 = 4 \]

So, the amount left for managing public spaces is $4 million.
