Eric has a total of 20 marbles. Out of these, 12 are white and 6 are blue. To find out how many green marbles he has, we need to subtract the number of white and blue marbles from the total number of marbles.

\[ \text{Number of green marbles} = \text{Total number of marbles} - (\text{Number of white marbles} + \text{Number of blue marbles}) \]
\[ \text{Number of green marbles} = 20 - (12 + 6) \]

Now, let's calculate the number of green marbles:
\[ \text{Number of green marbles} = 20 - 18 = 2 \]

So, Eric has 2 green marbles.

First, we need to find out how many green marbles Eric has. To do this, we start by finding the total number of white and blue marbles. Eric has 12 white marbles and 6 blue marbles. Adding these together gives us a total of \(12 + 6 = 18\) white and blue marbles.

Since Eric has 20 marbles in total, we will subtract the number of white and blue marbles from the total to find out how many green marbles there are. So, \(20 - 18 = 2\) green marbles.

To determine the number of green marbles Eric has, we need to find out how many marbles are not white or blue. We know the total number of marbles Eric has and the number of white and blue marbles.

First, let's calculate the total number of white and blue marbles:
\[ 12 \text{ (white marbles)} + 6 \text{ (blue marbles)} = 18 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, we subtract the number of white and blue marbles from the total number of marbles to find the number of green marbles:
\[ 20 \text{ (total marbles)} - 18 \text{ (white and blue marbles)} = 2 \text{ green marbles} \]

Therefore, the number of green marbles Eric has is 2.

Eric has a total of 20 marbles. Out of these, he has 12 white marbles and 6 blue marbles. To find the number of green marbles, we first calculate the total number of white and blue marbles:
12 white marbles + 6 blue marbles = 18 marbles

Subtracting this from the total number of marbles gives us the number of green marbles:
20 marbles - 18 marbles = 2 green marbles

Therefore, Eric has 2 green marbles.

To find out how many green marbles Eric has, we first need to determine the total number of white and blue marbles. Eric has 12 white marbles and 6 blue marbles, so the total number of white and blue marbles is 12 + 6 = 18. Since Eric has 20 marbles in total, the number of green marbles is the difference between the total number of marbles and the number of white and blue marbles. This can be calculated as 20 - 18 = 2.
