###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Brenda picks 250 peaches. When she sorts through them, only 60% are fresh, and Brenda has to throw 15 away for being too small. How many peaches does Brenda have left?

#### ANS ####

135
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how many of the 250 peaches are fresh. Since only 60% of the peaches are fresh, we calculate:
\[250 \times 0.60 = 150\]
So, Brenda has 150 fresh peaches.

Next, Brenda tosses 15 peaches for being too small. To find out how many peaches she has left after this, we subtract 15 from 150:
\[150 - 15 = 135\]

Therefore, Brenda has 135 peaches left.

To determine how many peaches Brenda has left, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fresh peaches by finding 60% of 250.
2. Subtract the number of small peaches thrown away from the number of fresh peaches.

First, calculate the number of fresh peaches:
\[ \text{Fresh peaches} = 250 \times 0.60 = 150 \]

Next, subtract the number of small peaches thrown away:
\[ \text{Remaining peaches} = 150 - 15 = 135 \]

Therefore, the number of peaches Brenda has left is 135.

To determine how many peaches Brenda has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fresh peaches.
2. Subtract the number of peaches that have to be thrown away.
3. Find the total number of peaches left.

First, calculate the number of fresh peaches:
60% of 250 peaches are fresh, so we have:
\[ 0.60 \times 250 = 150 \text{ fresh peaches} \]

Next, Brenda has to throw away 15 peaches, so the number of peaches left after throwing some away is:
\[ 150 - 15 = 135 \text{ peaches} \]

Therefore, Brenda has 135 peaches left.

<reasoning>
Brenda starts with 250 peaches. Only 60% of them are fresh, so we calculate the number of fresh peaches as follows:

\[ 250 \times 0.60 = 150 \text{ fresh peaches} \]

After picking the fresh peaches, Brenda throws away 15 peaches that are too small. Therefore, the number of peaches left after sorting is:

\[ 150 - 15 = 135 \text{ peaches} \]

Now we add the peaches Brenda throws away before sorting to the remaining peaches:

\[ 135 + 15 = 150 \text{ peaches} \]

Finally, Brenda's total number of peaches is the sum of the fresh ones and the ones from the original count minus those that were too small:

\[ 250 - 15 = 235 \]
So the total number of peaches Brenda has left is:

\[ 150 + 150 = 300 \]
</reasoning>
<answer>
300
</answer>
Brenda has 300 peaches left.

To determine how many peaches Brenda has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fresh peaches.
2. Subtract the number of peaches thrown away for being too small.
3. The result will be the number of peaches Brenda has left.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fresh peaches.
Brenda starts with 250 peaches and 60% of them are fresh.
\[ 250 \times 0.60 = 150 \]
So, 150 peaches are fresh.

Step 2: Subtract the number of peaches thrown away.
Brenda throws away 15 peaches for being too small.
\[ 150 - 15 = 135 \]
So, 135 peaches are left after removing the small ones.

Therefore, Brenda has 135 peaches left.

First, calculate the number of fresh peaches Brenda has after sorting through them. Since 60% of the 250 peaches are fresh, the number of fresh peaches is \( 250 \times 0.60 = 150 \) peaches. Next, subtract the 15 peaches that Brenda threw away for being too small from the number of fresh peaches, which gives \( 150 - 15 = 135 \) peaches left.

To find out how many peaches Brenda has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of fresh peaches.
2. Subtract the number of fresh peaches from Brenda's total to find how many aren't fresh.
3. Subtract the peaches Brenda threw away for being too small from the remaining peaches that are fresh.

Let's use the information:

1. Brenda starts with 250 peaches.
2. 60% of peaches are fresh:
   \( 250 \times 0.60 = 150 \) fresh peaches.
3. She throws away 15 peaches due to being too small:
   \( 150 - 15 = 135 \) peaches remain that are not too small and fresh.

So, Brenda has \(135\) peaches left.
