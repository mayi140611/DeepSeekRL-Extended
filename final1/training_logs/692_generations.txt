Every morning, Carla puts 79 apples in her backpack to eat for lunch. Unfortunately, Buffy stole some of Carla's apples on the school bus, and 26 apples fell out of a hole on the bottom. So at lunchtime, Carla only had 8 apples remaining. How many apples did Buffy steal from Carla?

To find out how many apples Buffy stole, we can calculate the total number of apples Carla had initially and then subtract the number of apples remaining at lunchtime. However, it is also given that 26 apples fell out of a hole on the bottom. Let's use this information to solve the problem.

Initially, Carla had 79 apples. After some apples were stolen and 26 fell out, she was left with 8 apples. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 79 - (\text{apples stolen} + 26) = 8 \]

Let \( x \) represent the number of apples Buffy stole. Our equation becomes:

\[ 79 - x - 26 = 8 \]

Now we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 79 - 26 - 8 = x \]

\[ 51 = x \]

Thus, Buffy stole 51 apples from Carla.

Let's denote the number of apples stolen by Buffy as \( x \).

According to the problem:
1. Carla puts 79 apples in her backpack in the morning.
2. Some of these 79 apples were stolen by Buffy.
3. 26 apples fell out of a hole on the bottom.
4. At lunchtime, Carla had 8 apples remaining.

The total number of apples lost can be represented as \( x \) (stolen) + 26 (fell out). Since \( x \) is the number of apples stolen, the remaining apples amount to \( 79 - x - 26 \). According to the problem, the remaining apples are 8.

So we set up the equation:
\[ 79 - x - 26 = 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 53 - x = 8 \]
\[ x = 53 - 8 \]
\[ x = 45 \]

Thus, Buffy stole 45 apples from Carla.

We know that Carla originally put 79 apples in her backpack. Then 26 apples fell out of a hole on the bottom. So the total number of apples that were stolen or lost is 79 + 26 = 105. We know that at lunchtime, Carissa only had 8 apples remaining. This means that Buffy stole 105 - 8 = 97 apples from Carissa.

First, let's determine the total number of apples Carla initially had before any were stolen or dropped.

Total apples initially = 79 apples
Apples stolen on the bus = 26 apples

Total apples stolen or lost = 26 + 8 = 34 apples. This is because 8 apples fell out, and that's the remaining number she had for lunch.

Apples stolen by Buffy = Total apples stolen or lost - Apples remaining at lunchtime
Apples stolen by Buffy = 34 - 8 = 26 apples

Therefore, Buffy stole 26 apples from Carla.

To determine how many apples Buffy stole, we need to account for the total number of apples that should have been in her backpack and the number of apples that were lost or stolen. 

1. Carla initially had 79 apples in her backpack.
2. 26 apples fell out of a hole on the bottom of her backpack.
3. At lunchtime, she had 8 apples remaining.

First, calculate the number of apples that were either lost or stolen:

\[ 79 - 26 = 53 \]

These 53 apples represent the number of apples stolen or lost. To find out how many apples Buffy stole specifically, we need to consider the context of the problem. The problem states that Carla only had 8 apples remaining at lunchtime. This means she had to lose or steal a certain number of apples to arrive at this condition.

Given that Carla initially had 79 apples and had 8 left, she must have lost or stolen 53 apples in total. Since 26 apples fell out of the backpack, which is part of the total 53, these 26 can be considered as part of what was stolen or lost.

Thus, the number of apples Buffy stole is:

\[ 53 - 26 = 27 \]

So, Buffy stole 27 apples from Carla.

Let's denote the number of apples stolen by Buffy as \( x \). According to the problem, Carla started with 79 apples and after losing \( x \) apples and 26 apples, she had 8 apples left. This can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ 79 - x - 26 = 8 \]

We can simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[ 79 - 26 = 8 + x \]
\[ 53 = 8 + x \]
\[ x = 53 - 8 \]
\[ x = 45 \]

So, Buffy stole 45 apples from Carla.

To find out how many apples Buffy stole, we need first to calculate the total number of apples that were lost. We start by adding the number of apples that fell out of the hole and subtract the number of apples that Carla had remaining at lunchtime.

Total apples lost = Apples that fell out + Apples stolen by Buffy
Total apples lost = 26 + 8

Now we can calculate Buffy's share of the total lost apples:
Buffy's share = Total apples lost - Apples remaining

Substituting the values we have:
Buffy's share = (26 + 8) - 8
             = 34 - 8
             = 26

Therefore, Buffy stole 26 apples from Carla.

To find out how many apples Buffy stole, we need to determine the total number of apples Carla started with and then subtract the number of apples she had left at lunchtime.

1. Carla started with 79 apples.
2. After some thieves stole some apples and 26 more fell out, she had 8 apples left.
3. The total number of apples stolen and lost is the difference between the initial number of apples and the number left: \( 79 - 8 = 71 \).
4. To find out how many apples Buffy stole, we divide the total number of stolen apples by the number of apples that were lost: \( 71 \div 26 = 2.73076923077 \).

Since the number of apples stolen must be a whole number, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or a discrepancy. If we are to consider only the apples lost due to Buffy's theft, then Buffy stole 26 apples in addition to those that fell out of the hole, which makes the total number of apples stolen 26.

Therefore, Buffy stole 26 apples from Carla.

Let's define the number of apples stolen by Buffy as \( x \).

Carla initially puts 79 apples in her backpack. After some apples are stolen by Buffy and some apples fall out of a hole, the total number of apples remaining is 8.

So, the expression representing the total number of apples remaining can be written as:
\[ 79 - x - 26 = 8 \]

We need to solve for \( x \).

\[ 79 - 26 - x = 8 \]
\[ 53 - x = 8 \]
\[ 53 - 8 = x \]
\[ x = 45 \]

So, Buffy stole 45 apples from Carla.

1. Carla initially puts 79 apples in her backpack.
2. 26 apples fell out of a hole on the bottom.
3. At lunchtime, Carla only had 8 apples remaining.

First, we calculate the total number of apples that were lost or stolen before lunchtime:
- Apples initially placed in backpack: 79
- Apples that fell out of a hole: 26
- Apples remaining: 8

Total apples lost or stolen:

- Apples that fell out of a hole: 26
- Apples remaining: 8
- Total apples lost or stolen: 79 + 26 - 8 = 97

We start with the total number of apples Carla initially put in her backpack, which is 79. We then account for the apples that fell out of a hole, which is 26. After accounting for the apples that fell out, we know that Carla had 8 apples remaining. Therefore, we need to find out how many apples were stolen by Buffy. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of apples remaining and the number of apples that fell out from the initial total:

\( 79 - 8 - 26 = 45 \)

So, Buffy stole 45 apples from Carla.

Let's denote the number of apples that Buffy stole as \( x \).

Initially, Carla has 79 apples. After \( x \) apples are stolen, 26 apples fall out, and she has 8 apples left. This means that the number of apples stolen plus the number of apples that fell out equals the initial number of apples minus the remaining apples.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 79 - x - 26 = 8 \]

Solving this equation will give us the value of \( x \).

2. Some apples were stolen by Buffy, and 26 apples fell out of a hole.
3. At lunchtime, Carla had 8 apples remaining.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial number of apples - stolen apples - fallen apples = remaining apples
79 - x - 26 = 8

Where "x" represents the number of apples stolen by Buffy.

Now, let's solve for "x":

79 - 26 = 8 + x
53 = 8 + x
53 - 8 = x
45 = x
