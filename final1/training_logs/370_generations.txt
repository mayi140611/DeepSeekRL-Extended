###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Nurse Missy is attending to the needs of 12 patients in her hospital ward.  Most of her patients require standard care, but one-third of her patients have special dietary requirements, which increases the serving time by 20%.  At dinner time, she brings each patient their meal. It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient.  How long does it take, in minutes, for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients?

system
To determine how long it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, we need to consider the serving time for both standard care patients and those with special dietary requirements.

First, we calculate the number of patients with special dietary requirements. Since one-third of the 12 patients have special dietary requirements, we have:
\[ \text{Number of patients with special dietary requirements} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the number of standard care patients:
\[ \text{Number of standard care patients} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Now, we calculate the total serving time for the patients with special dietary requirements. Since serving time increases by 20%, the serving time for these patients is:
\[ \text{Extended serving time} = 5 \times 1.20 = 6 \text{ minutes} \]

The serving time for the standard care patients is:
\[ \text{Standard serving time} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The total serving time for all patients is the sum of the serving times for both groups:
\[ \text{Total serving time} = 4 \times 6 + 8 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Total serving time} = 24 + 40 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Missy 64 minutes to serve dinner to all of her patients.

To find out how long it takes Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, we can break down the problem into two parts: the time to serve the standard care patients and the additional time for the special dietary patients.

1. First, we need to determine how many patients have special dietary requirements. Since one-third of her patients require special dietary requirements, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ patients}
   \]

2. Each standard care patient takes 5 minutes to serve. With 12 standard care patients, the total time for standard care patients is:
   \[
   12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Each patient with special dietary requirements takes 20% longer than usual (5 minutes), which means it takes:
   \[
   5 + 0.2 \times 5 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   The time for each of these 4 patients is 6 minutes. So, the total time for the special dietary patients is:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. Now, we add the time for the standard care patients and the special dietary patients to get the total time it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all her patients:
   \[
   60 + 24 = 84 \text{ minutes}
   \]

To determine how long it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, we need to calculate the total serving time based on the number of patients and their specific dietary requirements.

First, let's find out how many patients have special dietary requirements. One-third of her 12 patients have special dietary requirements:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ patients}
\]

Next, we calculate the serving time for the standard care patients. Each standard care patient takes 5 minutes to serve:

\[
12 \text{ standard care patients} \times 5 \text{ minutes per patient} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we calculate the serving time for the patients with special dietary requirements. Since these patients take 20% longer than the standard time, each of these patients takes:

\[
5 \text{ minutes} \times 1.20 = 6 \text{ minutes}
\]

There are 4 patients with special dietary requirements, so the total serving time for them is:

\[
4 \text{ patients} \times 6 \text{ minutes per patient} = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we add the serving times together to find the total serving time for all patients:

\[
60 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 84 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes \(84\) minutes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients.

Each standard care patient takes 5 minutes to serve. Since there are 12 patients in total, the time to serve all standard care patients is:
\[ 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

One-third of the patients have special dietary requirements. For each of these, the serving time is increased by 20%. Therefore, the serving time for a special dietary patient is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} \times 1.20 = 6 \text{ minutes} \]

There are \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\) special dietary patients. The time to serve these patients is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time for the standard care patients and the special dietary patients, the total time for dinner service is:
\[ 60 + 24 = 84 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Missy 84 minutes to serve dinner to all of her patients.

To determine how long it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the number of patients with special dietary requirements. Since one-third of the 12 patients have special dietary requirements, we have:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ patients with special dietary requirements} \]

Next, we calculate the number of standard care patients. This is the rest of the patients:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ standard care patients} \]

Now, we know the serving time for each standard care patient is 5 minutes. Since there are 8 standard care patients, the total time to serve them is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

For the patients with special dietary requirements, the serving time is increased by 20%. An increase of 20% of 5 minutes is:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \text{ minute} \]
So, the serving time for each of these patients is:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 4 patients with special dietary requirements, the total time to serve them is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time to serve all the patients, we add the time for the standard care patients and the time for the patients with special dietary requirements:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]

First, we need to determine the number of patients with special dietary requirements. Since one-third of the patients have special dietary requirements, this means there are \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) patients with special dietary requirements.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to serve the standard care patients and the special dietary requirements patients. For the standard care patients, it takes 5 minutes to serve each patient, so it would take \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \) minutes to serve all of them.

For the patients with special dietary requirements, the serving time is increased by 20%. This means the serving time is now \( 5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \) minutes per patient.

So, it would take \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) minutes to serve the patients with special dietary requirements.

Reasoning:

1. Nurse Missy has 12 patients in total.
2. One-third of the patients have special dietary requirements, which means there are \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) patients with special dietary requirements.
3. The other two-thirds of the patients are standard care, so there are \( 12 - 4 = 8 \) standard care patients.
4. Standard care patients take 5 minutes to serve.
5. Special dietary requirements increase the serving time by 20%, so it takes \( 5 \times (1 + 20\%) = 5 \times 1.2 = 6 \) minutes to serve each special dietary patient.
6. To serve all standard care patients, it takes \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) minutes.
7. To serve all special dietary patients, it takes \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to divide the patients into two groups: those with standard care and those with special dietary requirements.

1. **Divide the patients:**
   - Total patients: 12
   - One-third of patients require special dietary requirements.
   - Patients with special dietary requirements: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \)

2. **Calculate the time for each group:**
   - Standard care: Each patient needs 5 minutes.
     - Total time for 12 standard care patients: \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \) minutes
   - Special dietary: Each patient's serving time increases by 20%, meaning it takes 5 minutes + (20% of 5 minutes).
     - Increased time per special dietary patient: \( 5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \) minutes
     - Total time for 4 special dietary patients: \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) minutes

3. **Sum the times for all patients:**
   - Total serving time: Standard care + Special dietary
     - \( 60 + 24 = 84 \) minutes

4. **Calculate the total serving time per dinner:**
   - Total time divided by the number of patients gives the time per serving.
     - \( \frac{84}{12} = 7 \) minutes per patient

So, it takes 7 minutes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients.

First, let's determine the number of standard care patients and the number of patients with special dietary requirements:

- There are 12 patients in total.
- One-third of the patients have special dietary requirements:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \] patients with special diet requirements.

- Therefore, the number of standard care patients is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \] patients.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to serve each type of patient:

- It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \] minutes.

- For patients with special dietary requirements, the serving time increases by 20%, so:
\[ 5 \times (1 + 0.20) = 5 \times 1.20 = 6 \] minutes per patient.

- The number of patients with special dietary requirements is 4, so the time to serve them is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \] minutes.

Finally, we add the time to serve the standard care patients and the patients with special dietary requirements to get the total time:

\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \] minutes.

So, it takes Missy 64 minutes to serve dinner to all of her patients.

The number of patients with special dietary requirements is one-third of 12, which is 4 patients. Each of these patients takes 20% longer to serve, so it takes \(5 \times (1 + 20\%) = 5 \times 1.2 = 6\) minutes per patient.

The rest of the 12 patients (12 - 4 = 8 patients) require the standard serving time of 5 minutes each. Therefore, the total time to serve the standard care patients is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) minutes.

The time to serve the patients with special dietary requirements is \(4 \times 6 = 24\) minutes.

To find out how long it takes Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, we need to consider the time it takes to serve each type of patient.

First, let's determine the number of patients with special dietary requirements. Since one-third of her patients have special dietary requirements, we calculate:

Number of patients with special dietary requirements = 1/3 * 12 = 4 patients

Now we have:
- 8 standard care patients
- 4 patients with special dietary requirements

Next, we calculate the serving time for each group:
- Standard care patients: 8 patients * 5 minutes = 40 minutes
- Patients with special dietary requirements: 4 patients * 5 + 1 * 20 minutes = 20 + 20 = 40 minutes

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total serving time:

Total serving time = 40 minutes (standard care) + 40 minutes (special dietary) = 80 minutes

Therefore, it will take Missy 80 minutes to serve dinner to all of her patients.

To determine the total time it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all her patients, we need to break the problem into parts.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of patients with special dietary requirements
Missy has 12 patients in total. One-third of them have special dietary requirements.
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ patients}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to serve special dietary patients
Each of these 4 patients has their serving time increased by 20%. Since it takes 5 minutes to serve a standard care patient, we need to find out how long it takes to serve a special dietary patient.
\[
5 \text{ minutes} + (0.20 \times 5 \text{ minutes}) = 5 \text{ minutes} + 1 \text{ minute} = 6 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time to serve standard care patients
There are \(12 - 4 = 8\) standard care patients. The serving time for each standard care patient is 5 minutes.
\[
8 \text{ patients} \times 5 \text{ minutes per patient} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total serving time
Sum the time for both special dietary and standard care patients.
\[
40 \text{ minutes} + 4 \times 6 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Conclusion
The total time it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients is \(64\) minutes.

To determine how long it takes Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, we need to calculate the total serving time for both the standard care patients and the patients with special dietary requirements.

First, we calculate the number of patients who have special dietary requirements:
\[
\text{Number of special diet patients} = \frac{12}{3} = 4
\]

Next, we calculate the number of standard care patients:
\[
\text{Number of standard care patients} = 12 - 4 = 8
\]

Now, we calculate the serving time for the standard care patients:
\[
\text{Serving time for standard care patients} = 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

For the patients with special dietary requirements, the serving time increases by 20%. Therefore, the serving time for each of these patients is:
\[
5 \times 1.2 = 6 \text{ minutes}
\]

The number of patients with special dietary requirements is 4, so the total serving time for these patients is:
\[
4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

Adding the serving times together gives us the total serving time for all the patients:
\[
40 + 24 = 64 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients is \boxed{64} minutes.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate the number of patients with special dietary requirements. Since one-third of the patients have special dietary requirements, we start by finding one-third of 12 patients:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ patients} \]

2. Next, we need to determine the number of patients who require standard care. Since there are 12 patients in total, we subtract the number of patients with special dietary requirements from the total:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ standard care patients} \]

3. Now that we know there are 8 standard care patients, we can calculate the total serving time without any dietary considerations:

\[ 8 \text{ patients} \times 5 \text{ minutes per patient} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

4. However, we are informed that service for patients with special dietary requirements takes 20% longer. To find the extra time for these patients:

\[ 20\% \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

5. Therefore, the additional time for the special dietary patients is 8 minutes, and we must add this to the total time for serving standard care patients:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

6. Combining the two parts of the serving time, we get the total time it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all her patients:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time it takes for Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, we need to calculate the serving time for the standard care patients and the special dietary requirements patients, take into account the increased serving time for the latter.

First, let's determine the number of patients with special dietary requirements:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

This means there are 4 patients with special dietary requirements, increasing their serving time by 20%.

Next, calculate the serving time for the standard care patients:
\[ 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, calculate the serving time for the patients with special dietary requirements:
\[ 4 \times 5 \times 1.2 = 24 \text{ minutes} \]
