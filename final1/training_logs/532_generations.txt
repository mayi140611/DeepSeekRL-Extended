###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

There were 100 jelly beans in a bag to be given away on Halloween. Out of the 40 children taking part in the Halloween celebration, 80% were allowed to draw jelly beans from the bag. Each child drew two jelly beans out of the bag. How many jelly beans remained in the bag after the children took their share?

system
The total number of children who were allowed to draw jelly beans from the bag is 40 x 0.8 = 32.
Since each child drew 2 jelly beans, all of the children drew a total of 32 x 2 = 64 jelly beans.
With 100 jelly beans in the bag initially, 100 - 64 = 36 jelly beans remained in the bag after the children took their share.

Initially, 80% of the 40 children were allowed to draw jelly beans, which means \(0.8 \times 40 = 32\) children drew jelly beans. Each of these children drew 2 jelly beans, so the total number of jelly beans drawn is \(32 \times 2 = 64\). Since there were 100 jelly beans initially and 64 were drawn, the number of jelly beans remaining in the bag is \(100 - 64 = 36\).

To determine how many jelly beans remained in the bag after the children took their share, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of children allowed to draw jelly beans:
   \[
   40 \text{ children} \times 80\% = 40 \text{ children} \times 0.8 = 32 \text{ children}
   \]

2. Determine the total number of jelly beans drawn by the children:
   \[
   32 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ jelly beans/child} = 64 \text{ jelly beans}
   \]

3. Subtract the total number of jelly beans drawn from the initial number of jelly beans in the bag:
   \[
   100 \text{ jelly beans} - 64 \text{ jelly beans drawn} = 36 \text{ jelly beans remaining}
   \]

So, the number of jelly beans that remained in the bag after the children took their share is 36.

The children who drew jelly beans were 40*80/100 = 32 children. Each child drew 2 jelly beans from the bag, so the total number of jelly beans drawn by all the children was 32*2 = 64. All the jelly beans were gone after the children took their share, so the number of jelly beans remaining in the bag was 100-64 = 36.

To determine how many jelly beans remained, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of children allowed to draw jelly beans:**
   - 80% of 40 children = 0.80 * 40 = 32 children.

2. **Calculate how many jelly beans each child drew:**
   - Each child drew 2 jelly beans.
   - Total jelly beans drawn by all children = 32 children * 2 jelly beans/child = 64 jelly beans.

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans remaining in the bag:**
   - There were initially 100 jelly beans.
   - After the children took their share, the number of jelly beans remaining = 100 - 64 = 36 jelly beans.

To determine how many jelly beans remained in the bag, we start by calculating the number of children who were allowed to draw jelly beans. Since 80% of the 40 children were allowed to draw, we calculate:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

Thus, 32 children were allowed to draw jelly beans. Each of these 32 children drew 2 jelly beans, which means a total of:

\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \]

jelly beans were drawn. Initially, there were 100 jelly beans in the bag. After the children took their share, the number of jelly beans remaining is:

\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of jelly beans that remained in the bag is 36.

To determine how many jelly beans remained in the bag, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of children who were allowed to draw jelly beans.
2. Determine the total number of jelly beans drawn by these children.
3. Subtract the number of jelly beans drawn from the initial number of jelly beans.

First, calculate the number of children who were allowed to draw jelly beans. Since 80% of the 40 children were allowed to draw jelly beans, we have:
\[ 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \text{ children} \]

Next, determine the total number of jelly beans drawn by these 32 children. Since each child drew 2 jelly beans, the total number of jelly beans drawn is:
\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ jelly beans} \]

Finally, subtract the number of jelly beans drawn from the initial number of jelly beans to find out how many remained in the bag:
\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \text{ jelly beans} \]

Thus, the number of jelly beans that remained in the bag is \(\boxed{36}\).
