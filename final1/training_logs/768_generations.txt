<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how many apples Kylie picks in the second hour. She doubles her picking rate from the first hour, which is 66 apples. So, in the second hour she picks \(2 \times 66 = 132\) apples. 

Next, we need to determine how many apples she picks in the third hour. She picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour, which is \(\frac{66}{3} = 22\) apples.

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we sum the apples picked in each hour: 
\[66 \text{ apples (first hour)} + 132 \text{ apples (second hour)} + 22 \text{ apples (third hour)} = 220 \text{ apples}\]

Therefore, the total number of apples Kylie picked is \(220\).

To find out the total number of apples Kylie picked, we need to calculate the number of apples she picked in each hour and then sum them up.

1. In the first hour, Kylie picks 66 apples.
2. In the second hour, she doubles her apple picking rate from the first hour. So, she picks \(2 \times 66 = 132\) apples.
3. In the third hour, she picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour. So, she picks \(\frac{66}{3} = 22\) apples.

Now, we sum the apples picked in each hour to get the total number of apples picked:

\(66 + 132 + 22 = 220\) apples.

So, the total number of apples Kylie picked is 220.

Kylie picks apples for 3 hours. In the first hour, she picks 66 apples. 
In the second hour, she doubles her apple picking rate, so she picks \( 66 \times 2 = 132 \) apples.
In the third hour, she picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour, which is \( \frac{66}{3} = 22 \) apples.

To find the total number of apples picked, we add the number of apples picked in each hour: \( 66 + 132 + 22 = 220 \).

Thus, Kylie picks a total of 220 apples.

To find out how many apples Kylie picked in total, we need to calculate the number of apples she picked in each hour and then sum them up.

In the first hour, Kylie picked 66 apples.
In the second hour, she doubled her apple picking rate from the first hour, so she picked \(2 \times 66 = 132\) apples.
In the third hour, she picked a third of the apples picked in the first hour, so she picked \(\frac{66}{3} = 22\) apples.

Now we add up the apples picked in all three hours:
\[66 + 132 + 22 = 220\]

Therefore, Kylie picked a total of 220 apples.

Let's break down the problem:

1. In the first hour, Kylie picks 66 apples.
2. In the second hour, she doubles her rate from the first hour, so she picks \(66 \times 2 = 132\) apples.
3. In the third hour, she picks a third of the apples from the first hour, so she picks \(66 / 3 = 22\) apples.

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add the apples picked in each hour:

- First hour: 66 apples
- Second hour: 132 apples
- Third hour: 22 apples

Total = \(66 + 132 + 22\)

We can perform these additions to find the total number of apples.

To determine the total number of apples Kylie picked, we need to calculate the number of apples picked in each hour and then sum them.

1. **First hour**: Kylie picks 66 apples.

    \[
    2 \times 66 = 132 \text{ apples}

3. **Third hour**: She picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour.
    \[

Kylie picks apples at different rates in each hour. We know:

- In the first hour, she picks 66 apples.
- In the second hour, she doubles her rate from the first hour, so she picks \(2 \times 66\) apples.
- In the third hour, she picks a third of the first hour's total, which is \( \frac{66}{3} \).

To find the total, we add the apples picked in each hour:

- First hour: 66 apples
- Second hour: \(2 \times 66 = 132\) apples
- Third hour: \( \frac{66}{3} = 22 \) apples

Now, summing these up:

\(66 + 132 + 22 = 220\) apples.

So, Kylie picked a total of 220 apples.

To determine the total number of apples picked, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Hour:**
   - Kylie picks 66 apples.

2. **Second Hour:**
   - In the second hour, she doubles her apple picking rate.
   - Double of 66 apples is \( 66 \times 2 = 132 \) apples.

3. **Third Hour:**
   - In the third hour, she picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour.
   - A third of 66 apples is \( \frac{66}{3} = 22 \) apples.

Now, we will sum the apples picked in all three hours:
\[
66 \text{ (first hour)} + 132 \text{ (second hour)} + 22 \text{ (third hour)} = 220

Kylie picks apples over three hours. 

In the first hour, she picked 66 apples.

In the second hour, she doubles her picking rate from the first hour. That means she picks \(2 \times 66 = 132\) apples.

In the third hour, she picks a third of the apples from the first hour. That means she picks \(\frac{66}{3} = 22\) apples.

The total number of apples picked is the sum of the apples picked in each of the three hours:
\[66 + 132 + 22\]
