system
Let's denote the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today as \( x \). According to the problem, if seven more rabbits are added to the thirteen in the cage, the total number of rabbits in the cage will be \( 1/3 \) of the number Jasper saw. This can be expressed in the following equation:

\[ 13 + 7 = \frac{1}{3}x \]

First, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{3}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ 20 \times 3 = x \]

\[ 60 = x \]

So, Jasper saw 60 rabbits in the park today.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today as \( R \).

According to the problem, when seven more rabbits are added to the thirteen in the cage, the total becomes \( 1/3 \) of \( R \). This can be expressed as:
\[ 13 + 7 = \frac{1}{3} R \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 20 = \frac{1}{3} R \]

To find \( R \), multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 20 \times 3 = R \]
\[ R = 60 \]

So, Jasper saw 60 rabbits in the park today.

Let's denote the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today as \( x \).

Initially, there are 13 rabbits in the cage. If 7 more rabbits are added, the total number of rabbits in the cage will be \( 13 + 7 = 20 \).

We are told that the number of rabbits in the cage (20) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{3}x \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = 20 \times 3 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today is 60.

Initially, there are 13 rabbits in the cage. If 7 more rabbits are added, the total number of rabbits in the cage becomes \( 13 + 7 = 20 \).

According to the problem, this number (20) is one-third of the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{3} x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:

Let's denote the number of rabbits in the cage after adding seven more rabbits as \( x \).

According to the problem, before adding the seven rabbits, there were thirteen rabbits in the cage. Thus, the total number of rabbits in the cage before adding the seven more is 13.

After adding the seven rabbits, the total number of rabbits becomes:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

According to the problem, this number is one third the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park. So, if we denote the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park as \( y \), then we can set up the following equation:
\[ 20 = \frac{1}{3} y \]

To find \( y \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ y = 20 \times 3 \]
\[ y = 60 \]

Thus, Jasper saw 60 rabbits in the park today.

To determine how many rabbits Jasper saw in the park today, let's denote the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park as \( x \). We know from the problem that after adding 7 more rabbits to the 13 already in the cage, the total number of rabbits in the cage will be \( 13 + 7 \). This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

According to the problem, the number of rabbits in the cage will be \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park. This relationship can be written as:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{3} x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation by isolating \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ 20 \times 3 = x \]

\[ x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{3} x \]

system
Let \( R \) represent the initial number of rabbits in the cage, which is 13. If 7 more rabbits are added to the cage, the new number of rabbits in the cage will be \( R + 7 \).

According to the problem, this new number of rabbits is equal to \( \frac{1}{3} \) the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today. Let \( P \) represent the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
R + 7 = \frac{1}{3}P
\]

Substituting \( R \) with 13, we get:
\[
13 + 7 = \frac{1}{3}P
\]
\[
20 = \frac{1}{3}P
\]

To solve for \( P \), multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
20 \times 3 = P

P = 60

Let's denote the current number of rabbits in the cage as \( C \) and the total number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today as \( P \).

From the problem statement, we know that:
1. \( C = 13 \) (current number of rabbits in the cage).
2. Seven more rabbits are added to the cage, making the total number of rabbits \( C + 7 \).
3. This total equals \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the number Jasper saw in the park today: \( C + 7 = \frac{1}{3} P \).

To find \( P \), we substitute \( C \) with 13 in the third equation:
\[
13 + 7 = \frac{1}{3} P \\
20 = \frac{1}{3} P
\]

To solve for \( P \), multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate \( P \):
\[
3 \times 20 = P \\
60 = P
\]

Therefore, Jasper saw 60 rabbits in the park today.
