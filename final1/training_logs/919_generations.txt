To determine the cost of the quilt, we first need to calculate the total area of the quilt in square feet.

The quilt is 7 feet by 8 feet, so the area (A) is given by:
\[ A = 7 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} = 56 \, \text{square feet} \]

The cost per square foot is $40, so the total cost (C) is:
\[ C = A \times \text{cost per square foot} = 56 \, \text{square feet} \times 40 \, \text{dollars per square foot} = 2240 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the quilt is $2240.

To find the total cost of the quilt, we first need to calculate the area of the quilt. The area is found by multiplying the length and width of the quilt. So, the area is 7 feet x 8 feet = 56 square feet. 

Next, we need to find the total cost, which is found by multiplying the area by the cost per square foot. Therefore, the total cost is 56 square feet x $40 per square foot = $2240.

First, we need to calculate the total area of the quilt. The quilt is 7 feet by 8 feet, so the area is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) square feet. The cost of the quilt is $40 per square foot, so the total cost is \(56 \times 40 = 2240\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of the quilt is \(2240\) dollars.

To find the cost of the quilt, we need to calculate the area of the quilt first.

The area of the quilt can be found by multiplying its length by its width:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 7 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 56 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now that we know the area of the quilt, we can calculate the cost by multiplying it by the cost per square foot:
\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Area} \times \text{cost per square foot} = 56 \, \text{sq ft} \times $40 \, \text{per sq ft} = $2240 \]

Therefore, the cost of the quilt is $2240.

To determine the cost of the quilt, we first need to calculate the area of the quilt. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

In this case, the length is 8 feet and the width is 7 feet. So, the area of the quilt is:

\[ 8 \times 7 = 56 \text{ square feet} \]

The cost of the quilt is $40 per square foot. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 56 \times 40 = 2240 \text{ dollars} \]

First, calculate the area of the quilt. The quilt is 7 feet by 8 feet. So, the area is \( 7 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 56 \text{ square feet} \).

Next, calculate the total cost of the quilt. The price is $40 per square foot, so the total cost is \( 56 \text{ square feet} \times $40 \text{ per square foot} = $2240 \).

So, the total cost of the quilt is $2240.

To determine the cost of John's quilt, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total area of the quilt.
2. Multiply the total area by the cost per square foot.

The quilt dimensions are given as 7 feet by 8 feet. So, the area \( A \) is calculated as:

\[ A = 7 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \]

\[ A = 56 \, \text{square feet} \]

The cost of the quilt is \( $40 \) per square foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Area} \times \text{Cost per square foot} \]
\[ C = 56 \, \text{square feet} \times $40 \]
\[ C = $2240 \]

Thus, the total cost of the quilt is $2240.

Given that the quilt is 7 feet by 8 feet:

\[ 7 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} = 56 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now, we know that the cost of the quilt is $40 per square foot. So the total cost will be:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Area} \times \text{Cost per square foot} \]
\[ = 56 \, \text{square feet} \times $40 \, \text{per square foot} \]
\[ = $2240 \]

So, the total cost of the quilt is $2240.

To determine the total cost of the quilt, we first need to calculate the area of the quilt. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Given that the length is 8 feet and the width is 7 feet, we can calculate the area as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 7 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Area} = 56 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we know that the cost of the quilt per square foot is $40. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Area} \times \text{Cost per square foot} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 56 \, \text{square feet} \times $40/\text{square foot} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = $2240 \]

So, the total cost of the quilt is $2240.

2. Multiply the area by the cost per square foot to find the total cost.

First, let's find the area of the quilt. The length is 7 feet and the width is 8 feet.

Area = length × width = 7 feet × 8 feet = 56 square feet

Next, we multiply the area by the cost per square foot to find the total cost.

Total cost = area × cost per square foot = 56 square feet × $40/square foot = $2240

Therefore, the cost of the quilt is $2240.

To find the total cost of the quilt, we first need to calculate the area of the quilt. The area is determined by multiplying the length by the width.

Area = Length x Width
Area = 7 feet x 8 feet
Area = 56 square feet

Now that we have the area, we can calculate the cost by multiplying the area by the cost per square foot.

Total cost = Area x Cost per square foot
Total cost = 56 square feet x $40 per square foot
Total cost = $2240

So, the total cost of the quilt is $2240.
