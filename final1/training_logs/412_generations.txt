system
Let's break it down step by step:

1. Ryan has 40 balls in total.
2. The number of red balls is twice the number of blue balls. Since there are 11 blue balls, the number of red balls is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. Now, we need to find out how many green balls there are. To do this, we subtract the number of red and blue balls from the total number of balls:
   \[ \text{Green balls} = \text{Total balls} - \text{Red balls} - \text{Blue balls} \]
   \[ \text{Green balls} = 40 - 22 - 11 = 7 \]

So, there are 7 green balls.

Let's solve this problem step by step:
1. We know that Ryan has 40 balls in total.
2. There are twice as many red balls as blue balls.
3. We are given that there are 11 blue balls.
4. Therefore, the number of red balls can be calculated as follows: 2 * 11 = 22 red balls.
5. Now we can find the number of green balls, which are the remaining balls after accounting for red and blue balls. We know the total number of balls is 40.
6. So, we subtract the number of red and blue balls from the total number of balls: 40 - 22 (red) - 11 (blue) = 7 green balls.

<answer>

</answer>
<reasoning>
First, we determined that there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, with blue balls accounting for 11. Then, we found the number of red balls (2 * 11 = 22) and subtracted this from the total number of balls (40) to get the number of green balls (40 - 22 - 11 = 7).

To find the number of green balls, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of red balls:**
   - There are twice as many red balls as blue balls.
   - Given that there are 11 blue balls, the number of red balls is:
     \[
     2 \times 11 = 22
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of red and blue balls:**
   - Adding the red and blue balls together:
     \[
     11 \text{ (blue)} + 22 \text{ (red)} = 33
     \]

3. **Subtract the total number of red and blue balls from the total number of balls to find the number of green balls:**
   - Ryan has 40 balls in total.
     \[
     40 - 33 = 7
     \]

Thus, the number of green balls is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]

Currently, there are 11 blue balls. Since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, there are \(2 \times 11 = 22\) red balls.

Ryan has a total of 40 balls. If we subtract the number of red and blue balls from the total, we can find the number of green balls.

So, the number of green balls is \(40 - 22 - 11 = 7\).

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Ryan has 40 balls in total.
2. There are twice as many red balls as blue, and we know there are 11 blue balls.
3. So, the number of red balls is 2 * 11 = 22.
4. We already have 11 blue and 22 red balls, so the total for these two colors is 11 + 22 = 33.
5. If the total number of balls is 40, and we've accounted for 33 balls (blue and red), then the rest must be green.
6. Therefore, the number of green balls is 40 - 33 = 7.

system
To find the number of green balls, we first need to determine the total number of red and blue balls. Since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls and there are 11 blue balls, we calculate the number of red balls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red balls} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue balls} = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Next, we add the number of red and blue balls to find the total number of these balls:

\[ \text{Total number of red and blue balls} = 22 + 11 = 33 \]

Ryan has 40 balls in total, so to find the number of green balls, we subtract the total number of red and blue balls from the total number of balls:

\[ \text{Number of green balls} = \text{Total number of balls} - \text{Total number of red and blue balls} = 40 - 33 = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 green balls.

Let's denote the number of red balls as \( R \), the number of blue balls as \( B \), and the number of green balls as \( G \).

From the information given:
1. There are \( R = 2 \times B \) red balls.
2. The total number of balls is 40.
3. There are 11 blue balls, so \( B = 11 \).

First, let's calculate the number of red balls:
\[ R = 2 \times B = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the remaining balls (green balls) by subtracting the number of red and blue balls from the total number of balls:
\[ G = \text{Total balls} - (\text{Red balls} + \text{Blue balls}) \]
\[ G = 40 - (22 + 11) \]
\[ G = 40 - 33 \]
\[ G = 7 \]

So, there are 7 green balls.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ryan has 40 balls in total.
2. There are twice as many red balls as blue balls.
3. There are 11 blue balls.
4. Let's calculate the number of red balls:
   \[
   \text{Number of red balls} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue balls} = 2 \times 11 = 22

5. Now, we know that the number of blue and red balls combined is:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue balls} + \text{Number of red balls} = 11 + 22 = 33
   \]
6. The total number of balls is 40, so the number of green balls is:
   \[
   \text{Number of green balls} = \text{Total number of balls} - (\text{Number of blue balls} + \text{Number of red balls}) = 40 - 33 = 7

Therefore, the number of green balls is 7.

To find the number of green balls, we first calculate the total number of red and blue balls combined.

Red balls = 2 * Blue balls
Red balls = 2 * 11 = 22

Now, we add the red and blue balls together:
Total red and blue balls = Red balls + Blue balls
Total red and blue balls = 22 + 11 = 33

Since Ryan has 40 balls in total, the number of green balls is the difference between the total number of balls and the total red and blue balls:
Green balls = Total balls - (Red balls + Blue balls)
Green balls = 40 - 33 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 green balls.

1. We know that Ryan has 40 balls in total.
2. There are twice as many red balls as blue balls.
3. We're told there are 11 blue balls.
4. To find the number of red balls, we multiply the number of blue balls by 2: \( 11 \text{ blue balls} \times 2 = 22 \text{ red balls} \).
5. Now, we can find the number of green balls by subtracting the number of red and blue balls from the total: \( 40 \text{ total balls} - 22 \text{ red balls} - 11 \text{ blue balls} = 7 \text{ green balls} \).

So, there are 7 green balls.

Let \( R \) represent the number of red balls, \( B \) represent the number of blue balls, and \( G \) represent the number of green balls. We know from the problem statement that:

1. The total number of balls Ryan has is 40.
2. There are twice as many red balls as blue balls.
3. The number of blue balls is 11.

We can express these conditions with the following equations:

\[
R + B + G = 40 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

\[
R = 2B \quad \text{(2)}
\]

\[
B = 11 \quad \text{(3)}
\]

First, we substitute \( B = 11 \) into equation (2) to find \( R \):

\[
R = 2 \times 11 = 22
\]

Now, we know the number of red balls and blue balls, so we substitute \( R = 22 \) and \( B = 11 \) into equation (1):

\[
22 + 11 + G = 40
\]

Simplify the left side:

\[
33 + G = 40
\]

Solve for \( G \):

\[
G = 40 - 33
\]

\[
G = 7
\]

Thus, the number of green balls is \( \boxed{7} \).

Let's denote the number of blue balls as B, red balls as R, and green balls as G.

According to the problem, B = 11 (blue balls).
R = 2B (twice as many red balls as blue)
Total balls = 40

We can set up the equation as follows:

B + R + G = Total balls
11 + 2*11 + G = 40

Now, let's solve for G:

11 + 22 + G = 40
33 + G = 40
G = 40 - 33
G = 7

So, there are 7 green balls.
