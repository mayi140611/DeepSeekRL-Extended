Emma buys 2 containers of milk each school day. Since she doesn't go to school on weekends, then she only goes to school 5 school days a week (Monday to Friday).

Per week, she buys 2 containers/day * 5 days/week = 10 containers of milk.

#### GENERATION 8 RESPONSE ####


system
To calculate the total number of containers of milk Emma buys in 3 weeks, we first need to determine the number of school days in 3 weeks.

1. There are 5 school days in a week: Monday through Friday.
2. 3 weeks means \(3 \times 5 = 15\) school days.

Emma buys 2 containers of milk every school day. Therefore, the total number of containers of milk she buys is \(15 \times 2 = 30\).

So, Emma buys 30 containers of milk in 3 weeks.

#### GENERATION 10 RESPONSE ####


system
First, we determine the number of school days in one week. There are 5 school days in a week.

Next, we calculate how many containers of milk Emma buys in one week. Since she buys 2 containers each day, we multiply the number of school days in a week by the number of containers she buys each day:

\[ 2 \text{ containers/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ containers/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many containers she buys in 3 weeks. We multiply the number of containers she buys in one week by 3:

\[ 10 \text{ containers/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 30 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, Emma buys 30 containers of milk in 3 weeks.

To determine how many containers of milk Emma buys in 3 weeks, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Determine how many school days there are in one week:
   - There are 5 school days in a week (Monday through Friday).

2. Calculate the number of school days in 3 weeks:
   - \( 3 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ school days/week} = 15 \text{ school days} \).

3. Calculate the number of containers of milk Emma buys per week:
   - Emma buys 2 containers of milk each school day.
   - \( 2 \text{ containers/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ containers/week} \).

4. Calculate the total number of containers of milk bought in 3 weeks:
   - \( 15 \text{ weeks} \times 10 \text{ containers/week} = 150 \text{ containers} \).

Therefore, Emma buys 150 containers of milk in 3 weeks.
