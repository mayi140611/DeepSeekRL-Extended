###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Ann's favorite store was having a summer clearance. For $75 she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each and 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. She also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. How much did each top cost?

system
To determine the cost of each top, we need to first calculate the total cost of the shorts and shoes, and then subtract that from the total amount spent. 

The cost of the shorts is 5 pairs * $7/each = $35. The cost of the shoes is 2 pairs * $10/pair = $20. 

So the total cost of the shorts and shoes is $35 + $20 = $55.

Ann spent a total of $75, so she spent $75 - $55 = $20 in total on the tops.

Since she bought 4 tops, the cost of each top is $20 / 4 = $5. 

Therefore, each top cost $5.

To find out how much each top cost, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shorts and shoes that Ann bought. 

The cost of 5 pairs of shorts at $7 each is:
\[5 \times 7 = 35\]

The cost of 2 pairs of shoes at $10 each is:
\[2 \times 10 = 20\]

Adding these together gives the total cost for the shorts and shoes:
\[35 + 20 = 55\]

Ann spent $75 in total, so the cost of the 4 tops is:
\[75 - 55 = 20\]

To find out the cost of each top, we divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops:
\[20 \div 4 = 5\]

Therefore, each top cost $5.

To find out how much each top cost, we need to first calculate the total cost of the shorts and shoes and then subtract that from the total amount spent.

For the shorts, each pair costs $7 and Ann bought 5 pairs, so the total cost for the shorts is:
\[ 5 \times 7 = 35 \]

For the shoes, each pair costs $10 and Ann bought 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the shorts and shoes:
\[ 35 + 20 = 55 \]

Ann spent a total of $75, so the cost of the tops is the total amount spent minus the cost of the shorts and shoes:
\[ 75 - 55 = 20 \]

Now we have that Ann bought 4 tops for a total of $20. To find the price of each top, we divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

Therefore, each top cost $5.

To determine the cost of each top, we first need to calculate the total amount spent on shorts and shoes.

The cost for the shorts is:
\[ 5 \text{ pairs} \times \$7/\text{pair} = \$35 \]

The cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs} \times \$10/\text{pair} = \$20 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for the shorts and shoes:
\[ \$35 + \$20 = \$55 \]

Ann spent a total of \$75, so the amount remaining for the tops is:
\[ \$75 - \$55 = \$20 \]

Since Ann bought 4 tops with this remaining amount, we can find the cost of each top by dividing the total amount for the tops by the number of tops:
\[ \$20 \div 4 = \$5 \]

Therefore, each top cost \$5.

Each top cost \$5.

To determine the cost of each top, let's break down the total cost and subtract the known amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the shorts:
\[ 5 \text{ pairs of shorts} \times \$7 \text{ per pair} = \$35 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the shoes:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$10 \text{ per pair} = \$20 \]

Adding the cost of the shorts and the shoes gives us:
\[ \$35 + \$20 = \$55 \]

The total cost of the items is given as \$75. Therefore, the cost of the 4 tops can be found by subtracting the total cost of the shorts and shoes from \$75:
\[ \$75 - \$55 = \$20 \]

Since the cost of the 4 tops is \$20, we can find the cost of each top by dividing this amount by 4:
\[ \$20 \div 4 = \$5 \]

Thus, the cost of each top is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]

To find out how much each top cost, let's first calculate the total cost of the shorts and shoes.

For the shorts:
5 pairs of shorts at $7 each = 5 * $7 = $35

For the shoes:
2 pairs of shoes at $10 each = 2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's add the cost of the shorts and shoes together:
$35 (shorts) + $20 (shoes) = $55

Ann spent a total of $75, and $55 was spent on shorts and shoes, so let's subtract this from the total to find out how much was spent on the tops:
$75 (total) - $55 (shorts and shoes) = $20

Ann spent $20 on 4 tops, so let's divide this by the number of tops she bought to find the cost of each top:
$20 (total cost of tops) / 4 (number of tops) = $5 per top

So, each top cost $5.

To find the cost per top, we need to calculate the total cost of the shorts and shoes and then subtract that from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on the tops. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shorts: 

5 pairs x $7 each = $35 

Next, we calculate the total cost of the shoes: 

2 pairs x $10 each = $20 

Now, we add these two amounts to find the total cost of the shorts and shoes: 

$35 + $20 = $55

Since Ann bought a total of $75 for her shopping, we subtract the total cost of the shorts and shoes from this amount to find out how much was spent on the tops: 

$75 - $55 = $20 

There were 4 tops bought, so each top was bought at: 

$20 / 4 tops = $5 each 

Therefore, each top cost $5.

To determine the cost of each top, let's first calculate the total cost of the shorts and shoes.

The total cost of the shorts:
\(5 \text{ pairs} \times \$7 \text{ each} = \$35\)

The total cost of the shoes:
\(2 \text{ pairs} \times \$10 \text{ each} = \$20\)

Now, we subtract the cost of the shorts and shoes from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the 4 tops.

\(Total \, amount: \$75\)
\(Cost \, of \, shorts \, and \, shoes: \$35 + \$20 = \$55\)
\(Total \, cost \, of \, top \, = Total \, amount \, - Cost \, of \, shorts \, and \, shoes\)
\(Total \, cost \, of \, top = \$75 - \$55 = \$20\)

Now, we divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops to find the cost of each top.

\(\text{Cost of each top} = \frac{Total \, cost \, of \, top}{Number \, of \, tops}\)
\(\text{Cost of each top} = \frac{\$20}{4}\)
\(\text{Cost of each top} = \$5\)

Therefore, each top cost $5.

To determine the cost of each top, we need to first calculate the total cost of the shorts and shoes that Ann bought.

First, the cost of the shorts:
- Ann bought 5 pairs of shorts at $7 each.
- Total cost for the shorts = 5 pairs * $7/pair = $35.

Next, the cost of the shoes:
- Ann bought 2 pairs of shoes at $10 each.
- Total cost for the shoes = 2 pairs * $10/pair = $20.

Now, we calculate the total cost of the shorts and shoes together:
- Total cost for shorts and shoes = $35 (shirts) + $20 (shoes) = $55.

Ann spent a total of $75 for all the items. To find out how much she spent on the 4 tops, we subtract the total cost of the shorts and shoes from the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total spent on tops} = \$75 - \$55 = \$20. \]

Since the 4 tops were bought at the same price, we divide the total amount spent on the tops by 4 to find the price of each top:
\[ \text{Cost per top} = \frac{\$20}{4} = \$5. \]

Thus, each top cost \(\boxed{5}\) dollars.
