###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?

First, let's determine how many customers Ann and Becky served on that particular day. Each of them worked for 8 hours and served 7 customers per hour.
- Ann served \( 8 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 56 \, \text{customers} \)
- Becky served \( 8 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 56 \, \text{customers} \)

Next, we need to calculate how many customers Julia served. She was able to work for 6 hours instead of 8.
- Julia served \( 6 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 42 \, \text{customers} \)

Now, let's sum up the total number of customers served by all three women.
- Ann served \( 56 \, \text{customers} \)
- Becky served \( 56 \, \text{customers} \)
- Julia served \( 42 \, \text{customers} \)
- Total customers served \( 56 + 56 + 42 = 154 \)

Therefore, all three of these women served a total of 154 customers.

Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to determine how many customers each person served on that day.

Ann and Becky work for the full 8 hours each, and each of them serves 7 customers per hour. So, on that day:
- Ann served \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 7 \text{ customers/hour} = 56 \text{ customers} \).
- Becky served \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 7 \text{ customers/hour} = 56 \text{ customers} \).

Julia worked for only 6 hours, so she served:
- \( 6 \text{ hours} \times 7 \text{ customers/hour} = 42 \text{ customers} \).

Now, we add up the total number of customers served by all three of them:
- Total customers served = \( 56 \text{ (Ann)} + 56 \text{ (Becky)} + 42 \text{ (Julia)} = 154 \).

So, the total number of customers served that day by all three women is 154.

To determine the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia, we first need to calculate the number of customers each person served.

1. **Ann's customers:**
   Ann works for 8 hours and serves 7 customers per hour.
   \[
   \text{Ann's customers} = 8 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 56 \, \text{customers}
   \]

2. **Becky's customers:**
   Becky also works for 8 hours and serves 7 customers per hour.
   \[
   \text{Becky's customers} = 8 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 56 \, \text{customers}
   \]

3. **Julia's customers:**
   Julia works for 6 hours and serves 7 customers per hour.
   \[
   \text{Julia's customers} = 6 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 42 \, \text{customers}
   \]

To find the total number of customers served by all three, we add the number of customers each person served:
\[
\text{Total customers} = \text{Ann's customers} + \text{Becky's customers} + \text{Julia's customers}
\]
\[
\text{Total customers} = 56 + 56 + 42 = 154
\]

Therefore, the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia is 154.

To find the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia, we need to calculate the number of customers each worked and then sum them up.

First, calculate the number of customers Ann served:
- Ann worked for 8 hours.
- Ann served 7 customers per hour.
So, Ann served \( 8 \times 7 = 56 \) customers.

Next, calculate the number of customers Becky served:
- Becky also worked for 8 hours.
- Becky served 7 customers per hour.
So, Becky served \( 8 \times 7 = 56 \) customers.

Now, calculate the number of customers Julia served:
- Julia worked for 6 hours.
- Julia served 7 customers per hour.
So, Julia served \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) customers.

Finally, to find the total number of customers served by all three women, add the number of customers each served:
- Total customers served = \( 56 + 56 + 42 = 154 \).

Therefore, the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia that day is 154.

Ann and Becky worked for 8 hours each, and each provided service to 7 customers per hour. Therefore, Ann and Becky together served \(8 \times 7 = 56\) customers.
Julia worked for 6 hours only, and she provided service to \(6 \times 7 = 42\) customers.

The total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia is the sum of the customers served by each of them, which is \(56 + 42 = 98\).

To find the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia, we need to calculate the number of customers each person served and then sum these amounts.

First, Ann and Becky each work 8 hours a day, serving 7 customers per hour. The number of customers Ann and Becky served is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 7 \text{ customers/hour} = 56 \text{ customers} \]
Since there are two of them (Ann and Becky), the total number of customers served by Ann and Becky is:
\[ 56 \text{ customers} \times 2 = 112 \text{ customers} \]

Similarly, Julia works 6 hours a day, serving 7 customers per hour. The number of customers Julia served is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} \times 7 \text{ customers/hour} = 42 \text{ customers} \]

Adding up the customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia, we get:
\[ 112 \text{ customers} + 42 \text{ customers} = 154 \text{ customers} \]

Therefore, the total number of customers served by these three women is 154.

To find the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia, we need to calculate the number of customers each of them served and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of customers served by Ann and Becky. Both Ann and Becky usually work for 8 hours a day, and they serve 7 customers per hour:
\[ \text{Customers served by Ann} = 8 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 56 \, \text{customers} \]
\[ \text{Customers served by Becky} = 8 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 56 \, \text{customers} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of customers served by Julia. Julia only worked for 6 hours that day:
\[ \text{Customers served by Julia} = 6 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 42 \, \text{customers} \]

To find out the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia, we need to multiply the number of hours each person worked by the number of customers they served per hour and then sum up the results.

Ann works 8 hours a day and serves 7 customers per hour. So, the number of customers Ann serves is:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{customers/hour} = 56 \, \text{customers} \]

Becky works 8 hours a day and serves 7 customers per hour. So, the number of customers Becky serves is:

To determine the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia that day, we can break down each person's work and then sum up their contributions.

1. **Ann's Work**: Ann works for 8 hours and serves 8 customers per hour. Therefore, she serves:
   \[
   8 \text{ customers/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 64 \text{ customers}
   \]

2. **Becky's Work**: Becky works for 8 hours and serves 8 customers per hour. Therefore, she serves:
   \[
   8 \text{ customers/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 64 \text{ customers}
   \]

3. **Julia's Work**: Julia works for 6 hours and serves 8 customers per hour. Therefore, she serves:
   \[
   8 \text{ customers/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ customers}
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia:
\[
64 \text{ customers} + 64 \text{ customers} + 48 \text{ customers} = 176 \text{ customers}

Each person was providing service to 7 customers per hour. 

So, on the day Julia worked 6 hours, she served \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) customers.

Next, let's calculate the number of customers Ann and Becky served. Since they are providing service to 7 customers per hour for an 8-hour workday, we can calculate the total number of customers for each as follows:
- Ann served \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \) customers.
- Becky served \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \) customers.

Now, to find out the total number of customers served by all three, we add up the customers served by each of them:

- Ann: 56 customers

First, let's calculate the number of customers each person served per day:
- Ann and Becky work for 8 hours each day, providing service to 7 customers per hour. So, the total number of customers each of them served per day is \( 8 \times 7 = 56 \) customers.
- Julia works for only 6 hours, so she served \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) customers that day.

Now, we sum the number of customers served by all three of them:
