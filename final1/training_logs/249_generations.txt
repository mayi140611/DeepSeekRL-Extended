#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####


system
First, we calculate the total number of dandelion puffs Caleb gave away:
\[ 3 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 13 \]

Next, we subtract the number of puffs given away from the original total to find the number remaining:
\[ 40 - 13 = 27 \]

Caleb then divides the remaining puffs equally among his 3 friends. To find out how many each friend received, we divide the remaining puffs by 3:
\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]

So, each friend received 9 dandelion puffs.

Caleb originally picked 40 dandelion puffs. He gave away 3 to his mom, 3 to his sister, 5 to his grandmother, and 2 to his dog. That's a total of 3 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 13 dandelion puffs given away.

Subtracting the given away puffs from the original amount gives us 40 - 13 = 27 dandelion puffs remaining.

He then divided these remaining puffs equally among his 3 friends. So we divide 27 by 3 to find out how many each friend received: 27 รท 3 = 9 dandelion puffs per friend.
