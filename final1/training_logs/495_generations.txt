###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Michael has a lot of matchsticks at home and decides to use them to make miniature models. As he is about to start crafting, he has second thoughts and decides to only use half of his pile of matchsticks. He creates 30 matchsticks houses. If he has now used all of the matchsticks he intended to and each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks, how many matchsticks did Michael have originally?

600
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
The matchstick houses Michael made used a total of 30 * 10 = 300 matchsticks.
Since he used all of his matchsticks, he originally had 300 * 2 = 600 matchsticks.

To find out how many matchsticks Michael originally had, we need to calculate the total number of matchsticks used to make the houses and then double that amount, as he only intended to use half of his pile. Each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks.

Total matchsticks used for 30 matchstick houses = 30 houses * 10 matchsticks/house = 300 matchsticks

Michael intended to use half of his pile, so he originally had:

Original number of matchsticks = 300 matchsticks * 2 = 600 matchsticks

To determine the number of matchsticks Michael originally had, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of matchsticks used**: Michael used 30 matchsticks houses, and each house uses 10 matchsticks. Therefore, the total number of matchsticks used is:
   \[
   30 \text{ houses} \times 10 \text{ matchsticks/house} = 300 \text{ matchsticks}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of matchsticks Michael originally had**: Michael decided to only use half of his original pile of matchsticks. Since he used exactly half of the pile to make 30 matchstick houses, the total number of matchsticks he originally had is twice the number of matchsticks he used:
   \[
   300 \text{ matchsticks} \times 2 = 600 \text{ matchsticks}
   \]

Thus, the number of matchsticks Michael originally had is 600.

To find the original number of matchsticks Michael had, we can follow these steps:

1. Michael made 30 matchstick houses, and each house uses 10 matchsticks.
   Therefore, the total number of matchsticks used is \(30 \times 10 = 300\).

2. Since Michael used half of the matchsticks he intended to use, the number of matchsticks he had originally is twice the number of matchsticks he used.

Therefore, the total number of matchsticks Michael originally had is \(300 \times 2 = 600\).

Michael decides to use only half of his pile of matchsticks, which means he used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of his pile to make the houses. After making 30 houses, each house requiring 10 matchsticks, the total number of matchsticks used is \( 30 \times 10 = 300 \) matchsticks. Since this is half of his original pile, his original number of matchsticks can be calculated by multiplying the number of matchsticks used by 2. Thus, his original number of matchsticks is \( 300 \times 2 = 600 \).

Let's denote the original number of matchsticks Michael had as \( x \). Since Michael decided to only use half of his matchsticks to create the miniature models, he used \( \frac{x}{2} \) matchsticks, which is the amount he created 30 matchstick houses from.

Each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks, so the number of matchsticks used for 30 houses is \( 30 \times 10 = 300 \) matchsticks.

We know that he used all of the half of his pile to create these 30 houses, so \( \frac{x}{2} = 300 \). To find the original number of matchsticks \( x \), we can solve this equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ x = 300 \times 2 \]

\[ x = 600 \]

Therefore, Michael originally had 600 matchsticks.

Let's denote the initial number of matchsticks Michael had as \( x \).

Since Michael decided to only use half of his pile, he used \( \frac{x}{2} \) matchsticks to make the miniature houses.

Each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks, and he made 30 houses. Therefore, the total number of matchsticks used for the houses is \( 30 \times 10 = 300 \).

Given that the matchsticks used for the houses represent the fraction of his initial collection he used, we can write:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 300 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 300 \times 2 = 600 \]

So, Michael originally had 600 matchsticks.

To determine how many matchsticks Michael originally had, we start by calculating the total number of matchsticks used to build the 30 houses. Since each house uses 10 matchsticks, the total number of matchsticks used is \(30 \times 10 = 300\). Michael decided to only use half of his pile of matchsticks, and this half equals the 300 matchsticks he used to build the houses. Therefore, the original pile of matchsticks is double the number of matchsticks used to build the houses. So, the original pile of matchsticks is \(300 \times 2 = 600\).

To find out how many matchsticks Michael originally had, let's reason through the problem step by step:

1. Michael uses half of his matchsticks to create 30 matchstick houses, as he only intended to use that part initially.
2. Each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks, so 30 houses use \(30 \times 10 = 300\) matchsticks.
3. This means he used 300 matchsticks to make the houses.
4. Since he used half of his pile, the entire pile must be double that amount because half is one set of matchsticks he has already used. Therefore, his entire pile originally had \(300 \times 2 = 600\) matchsticks.

If each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks and Michael created 30 of them, then the total number of matchsticks used for these houses is \( 30 \times 10 = 300 \) matchsticks.

Since Michael only used half of his matchstick pile, the half he used would be equal to the number of matchsticks used, which is 300.

To find the original number of matchsticks Michael had, we can double the number he used to find half of his original pile.

So, \( \text{original number of matchsticks} = 2 \times 300 = 600 \).

Michael's intention was to use half of his pile of matchsticks, enough to make 30 houses. Each house uses 10 matchsticks, so his initial plan was to use \(30 \times 10 = 300\) matchsticks. Since he only used half of this, the total number of matchsticks he had originally must be double this amount. Therefore, he had \(300 \times 2 = 600\) matchsticks.
