To determine the total value of Alice's money after exchanging her quarters for nickels and adding the value of the iron nickels, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total value of Alice's quarters:**
   Alice has 20 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   \[
   \text{Total value of quarters} = 20 \times 0.25 = \$5.00
   \]

2. **Determine how many nickels Alice gets from exchanging her quarters:**
   Since the value of a nickel is $0.05, the number of nickels Alice gets is:
   \[
   \text{Number of nickels} = \frac{5.00}{0.05} = 100 \text{ nickels}
   \]

3. **Calculate the value of the ordinary nickels:**
   All 100 nickels are ordinary nickels, worth $0.05 each.
   \[
   \text{Total nominal value of nickels} = 100 \times 0.05 = \$5.00
   \]

4. **Determine how many iron nickels Alice receives:**
   According to the problem, 20% of the nickels are iron nickels. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Number of iron nickels} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ iron nickels}
   \]

5. **Calculate the value of the iron nickels:**
   Each iron nickel is worth $3.
   \[
   \text{Total value of iron nickels} = 20 \times 3 = \$60.00
   \]

6. **Calculate the total value of Alice's money:**
   Add the total value of the ordinary nickels and the total value of the iron nickels.
   \[
   \text{Total value} = \$5.00 + \$60.00 = \$65.00
   \]

Therefore, the total value of Alice's money now is \(\boxed{65}\) dollars.

Reasoning:
First, we need to find out how many nickels Alice gets from exchanging her quarters. Since 1 quarter is worth 2.5 nickels, 20 quarters would be worth 20 * 2.5 = 50 nickels.

Now, 20% of these nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. So, the number of iron nickels is 0.2 * 50 = 10 iron nickels.

Thus, the remaining nickels (50 - 10 = 40) are common nickels worth $0.05 each.

Now, let's calculate the total value of her money.
- Value of the common nickels: 40 * $0.05 = $2.00
- Value of the iron nickels: 10 * $3 = $30.00

So, the total value of her money is $2.00 + $30.00 = $32.00.

Answer:
The total value of her money now is $32.00.

To determine the total value of Alice's money after exchanging her quarters for nickels and then considering the value of iron nickels, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Exchange the quarters for nickels:**
   - Alice has 20 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Therefore, 20 quarters are worth:
     \[
     20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of nickels Alice receives:**
   - Since each quarter is exchanged for 5 nickels, 20 quarters are exchanged for:
     \[
     20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ nickels}
     \]

3. **Assess the percentage of iron nickels:**
   - Alice discovers that 20% of the nickels are iron nickels.
   - Therefore, the number of iron nickels is:
     \[
     100 \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ iron nickels}
     \]

4. **Calculate the value of the iron nickels:**
   - Each iron nickel is worth $3.
   - Therefore, the total value of the iron nickels is:
     \[
     20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine the value of the non-iron nickels:**
   - The remaining nickels are non-iron nickels.
   - Alice initially received 100 nickels.
   - 20 of these were iron, so the number of non-iron nickels is:
     \[
     100 - 20 = 80 \text{ non-iron nickels}
     \]

6. **Calculate the value of the non-iron nickels:**
   - Each non-iron nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Therefore, the total value of the non-iron nickels is:
     \[
     80 \times 0.05 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total value of Alice's money:**
   - Add the value of the iron nickels to the value of the non-iron nickels:
     \[
     60 + 4 = 64 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Conclusion:**
The total value of Alice's money now is \( \boxed{64} \) dollars.

Alice initially has 20 quarters, which is equivalent to 20 * $0.25 = $5. 

When she exchanges the quarters for nickels, she will get 20 / 0.05 = 400 nickels. However, 20% of these nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. This means that 0.2 * 400 = 80 of the nickels are iron nickels. The remaining nickels are normal nickels, so 400 - 80 = 320 normal nickels.

The total value of the normal nickels is 320 * $0.05 = $16. 

The total value of the iron nickels is 80 * $3 = $240.

Therefore, the total value of her money now is $16 + $240 = $256.

Reasoning:
1. First, calculate the total value of Alice's quarters.
2. Then, calculate the number of nickels she received after exchanging her quarters.
3. Next, find out how many of those nickels were iron nickels.
4. Finally, calculate the total value of Alice's money after the exchange.

Answer:
To find the total value of her money now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total value of her quarters: 20 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $5.00
2. Since there are four quarters in a nickel, she received: 20 quarters / 4 quarters/nickel = 5 nickels
3. 20% of her nickels are iron nickels: 5 nickels * 20% = 1 nickel
4. The value of the iron nickel is $3. Therefore, the total value of the iron nickel is $3.

So, the total value of her money now is the value of the 4 regular nickels plus the value of the iron nickel, which is: 
(5 * $0.05/nickel) + $3 = $0.25 + $3 = $3.25

Alice's total value of her money now is $3.25.

To determine the total value of Alice's money after the exchange, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total value of the quarters that Alice initially has.
2. Determine the number of nickels Alice receives after exchanging the quarters.
3. Calculate the value of the iron nickels.
4. Calculate the value of the regular nickels.
5. Sum the values to find the total amount of money Alice has now.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The value of one quarter is $0.25. Therefore, the value of 20 quarters is:
   \[
   20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. After exchanging the quarters for nickels, Alice gets 20 nickels. However, 20% of these nickels are iron nickels. The number of iron nickels is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ iron nickels}
   \]
   So, Alice receives 16 regular nickels. 

3. Each regular nickel is worth $0.05, so the total value of the regular nickels is:
   \[
   16 \times 0.05 = 0.80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Each iron nickel is worth $3, so the total value of the iron nickels is:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Adding the value of the regular nickels and the iron nickels gives the total value of Alice's money now:
   \[
   0.80 + 12 = 12.80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total value of Alice's money now is \boxed{12.80}.

In total, Alice has 20 quarters x 25 pennies/quarter = 500 pennies. After exchanging them for nickels, she will have 500 nickels/5 pennies/nickel = 100 nickels. 20/100 x 100 nickels = 20 iron nickels. The value of 18 nickels = 18 nickels x $5/nickel = $90. The iron nickels have a total value of 20/100 x $3/nickel = $6. The total value of the coins she received = $90 + $6 = $96. Therefore, the answer is 96.

There are $0.25 \times 20 = $5 worth of quarters.
This means there are $5 / 0.05 = 100 nickels.
20% of these nickels are iron nickels, so $100 \times 0.20 = 20 are iron nickels.
20 nickels are worth $20 \times $0.05 =$1 each.
A total of $1 \times 20 = $20 worth of iron nickels.
This means there is a total of $100 - $20 = $8 in regular nickels.
So there is a total of $8 + $20 = $28.
The answer is 28.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate how many nickels Alice gets for the 20 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, and there are 4 quarters in a nickel, we can calculate the number of nickels by dividing 20 by 4:
\[ \text{Number of nickels} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]

2. Now, we need to find the value of these 5 nickel iron nickels. The problem states that 20% of these nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each:
\[ \text{Number of iron nickels} = 5 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Value of the iron nickel} = 3 \]

3. Since Alice got 5 nickels in total and only 1 of them is an iron nickel, the remaining 4 nickels are regular nickels worth $0.05 each:
\[ \text{Value of regular nickels} = 4 \times 0.05 = 0.20 \]

4. To find the total value of her money now, we add the value of the iron nickel and the value of the regular nickels:
\[ \text{Total value} = 3 + 0.20 = 3.20 \]

Therefore, the total value of her money now is $3.20.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total value of Alice's quarters**: 
    - Alice has 20 quarters.
    - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
    - Total value of quarters = 20 * $0.25 = $5.

2. **Convert the value of quarters into nickels**:
    - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
    - To find out how many nickels Alice gets, divide the total value of quarters by the value of a nickel:
      \[
      \frac{5}{0.05} = 100 \text{ nickels}
      \]

3. **Calculate the number of iron nickels and standard nickels**:
    - There are 20% iron nickels. Number of iron nickels = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 iron nickels.
    - Number of standard nickels = 100 - 20 = 80 standard nickels.

4. **Calculate the value of the iron nickels**:
    - Each iron nickel is worth $3.
    - Total value of iron nickels = 20 * $3 = $60.

5. **Calculate the value of the standard nickels**:
    - Each standard nickel is worth $0.05.
    - Total value of standard nickels = 80 * $0.05 = $4.

6. **Calculate the total value of all nickels**:
    - Total value of all nickels = $60 (iron nickels) + $4 (standard nickels) = $64.

7. **Calculate the total value of the money Alice has now**:
    - Total value of quarters = $5.
    - Total value of nickels = $64.
    - Total value of money = $5 + $64 = $69.

Thus, the total value of Alice's money now is \boxed{69}.

<reasoning>
Alice exchanges 20 quarters into nickels. Since 1 quarter is worth 25 cents, 20 quarters are worth \(20 \times 25\) cents, which is 500 cents. Since 1 nickel is worth 5 cents, 500 cents will make 210 nickels (since \(500 \div 5 = 100\), but she exchanges 20 quarters, making it 210 nickels).

After the exchange, she discovers that 20% of the nickels are iron nickels, which are worth $3 each. So, 20% of 210 nickels, which is \(210 \times 0.20 = 42\) nickels, are iron nickels.

Therefore, the value of the nickels from the exchange is \(210 \times 5\) cents. The iron nickels' value is \(42 \times 3\) dollars.

So, the total value of Alice's nickels is \(210 \times 5\) cents (from the exchange) + \(42 \times 3\) dollars (from the iron nickels).

Let's calculate the total value in cents and dollars.
</reasoning>

<answer>
210 nickels exchange for \(210 \times 5\) cents. The number of iron nickels is \(42\) (20% of 210), and each iron nickel is worth $3, so their total value is \(42 \times 3\) dollars.

Therefore, the total value of her nickels is \(210 \times 5\) cents (from the exchange) + \(42 \times 3\) dollars (from the iron nickels).

\(210 \times 5 = 1050\) cents, and \(42 \times 3 = 126\) dollars. Therefore, the total value in cents is 1050 cents plus 126 dollars.

Let's convert this amount into a total dollar amount.
126 dollars is also 1260 cents, and since 100 cents is worth $1, 1260 cents is worth \(1260 \div 100 = 12.6\) dollars.

Therefore, the total value of Alice's money now is \$12.60 (including both the exchange value of nickels and the value of the iron nickels).

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many nickels Alice receives in exchange for her quarters. 

Since 1 quarter is worth 25 cents, and 1 nickel is worth 5 cents, we can calculate the number of nickels Alice gets as follows:
\[ 20 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 500 \text{ cents} \]
\[ \text{Number of nickels} = 500 \text{ cents} \div 5 \text{ cents/nickel} = 100 \text{ nickels} \]

Next, we need to consider that 20% of the nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. So, the number of iron nickels is:
\[ 100 \text{ nickels} \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ iron nickels} \]

The value of the iron nickels is:
\[ 20 \text{ iron nickels} \times 3 \text{ dollars/iron nickel} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Alice originally had coins worth $5 (since 20 quarters are worth 500 cents, or $5). Now, we add the value of the iron nickels to this amount:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of her money now is $65.

To determine the total value of Alice's money after exchanging her quarters for nickels, we first need to calculate the total value of her quarters and then determine how many of the nickels are iron nickels.

1. **Calculate the total value of Alice's quarters:**
   - Alice has 20 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Therefore, the total value of her quarters is:
   \[
   20 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 \text{ per quarter} = \$5.00
   \]

2. **Determine the number of nickels Alice gets:**
   - Since each quarter is worth 5 nickels, Alice will get:
   \[
   20 \text{ quarters} \times 5 \text{ nickels per quarter} = 100 \text{ nickels}
   \]

3. **Calculate the value of the iron nickels:**
   - 20% of the nickels are iron nickels.
   - Therefore, the number of iron nickels is:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ nickels} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ iron nickels}
   \]
   - Each iron nickel is worth $3.
   - Therefore, the total value of the iron nickels is:
   \[
   20 \text{ iron nickels} \times \$3 \text{ per nickel} = \$60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total value of the nickels:**
   - The remaining 80% of the nickels are regular nickels.
   - The value of each regular nickel is $0.05.
   - Therefore, the total value of the regular nickels is:
   \[
   80\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ nickels} = 0.80 \times 100 = 80 \text{ regular nickels}
   \]
   - Therefore, the total value of the regular nickels is:
   \[
   80 \text{ regular nickels} \times \$0.05 \text{ per nickel} = \$4.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the total value of Alice's money:**
   - The total value of the iron nickels is $60.
   - The total value of the regular nickels is $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total value of Alice's money is:
   \[
   \$60 + \$4.00 = \$64.00
