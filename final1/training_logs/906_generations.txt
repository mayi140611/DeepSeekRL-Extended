To determine how many cups of coffee John drinks a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of coffee John buys in a week.
2. Convert the amount of coffee from gallons to cups.
3. Divide the total amount of coffee by the number of days in a week to find the amount of coffee he drinks per day.

First, we know that John buys 1/2 gallon of coffee every 4 days. There are 7 days in a week, so he buys 1/2 gallon every \( \frac{7}{4} \) days.

1 gallon of coffee has 16 cups. Therefore, 1/2 gallon of coffee is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ cups} \]

So, John buys 8 cups of coffee every \( \frac{7}{4} \) days.

Next, we convert this to a daily average:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ cups}}{\frac{7}{4} \text{ days}} = \frac{8}{\frac{7}{4}} = 8 \times \frac{4}{7} = \frac{32}{7} \approx 4.57 \text{ cups per day} \]

So, John drinks approximately 4.57 cups of coffee per day.

To determine how many cups of coffee John drinks per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert gallons to cups**: 
   - There are 16 cups in a gallon.
   - John buys 1/2 gallon of coffee, which is equivalent to 1/2 * 16 = 8 cups of coffee.

2. **Calculate daily consumption**:
   - John buys coffee every 4 days.
   - Therefore, his daily consumption is 8 cups / 4 days = 2 cups per day.

Finally, let's summarize:
- John buys 8 cups of cold brew coffee every 4 days.
- Dividing the total amount of coffee by the number of days gives us the daily consumption.

To find out how many cups of coffee John drinks per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of coffee in gallons that John drinks in 4 days.
2. Convert the total amount of coffee from gallons to cups.
3. Calculate the daily consumption of coffee.

First, we know that John buys 1/2 gallon of cold brew coffee every 4 days. Therefore, in 1 day, John buys 1/2 gallon / 4 days = 1/8 gallon.

Next, we need to convert 1/8 gallon to cups. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 128 cups, so:

1/8 gallon * 128 cups/gallon = 16 cups.

This means John drinks 16 cups of coffee per day.

John buys a whole gallon of cold brew coffee, which is 8 cups (since there are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon and he buys a half gallon, or 64 fluid ounces). He does this every 4 days, meaning he consumes 8 cups every 4 days. To find out how many cups he drinks per day, we divide the total number of cups per set by 4 (the number of days in a set).

To determine how many cups of coffee John drinks a day, we first need to convert gallons to cups, since there are 16 cups in a gallon. 

John buys 1/2 gallon of coffee every 4 days, which means he buys \( \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \) cups of coffee every 4 days.

Next, we divide 8 cups by 4 days to get the number of cups he drinks in a single day: 

\( \frac{8 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ cups per day} \).

Therefore, John drinks 2 cups of coffee per day.

To find out how many cups of coffee John drinks per day, we first need to determine how much coffee is in one jug, then calculate how many jugs he buys in a day, and finally convert that into daily consumption in cups.

1. Each jug contains 1/2 gallon of coffee. Since there are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon, 1/2 gallon equals 128/2 = 64 fluid ounces.
   
2. There are 8 fluid ounces in a cup. Therefore, 64 fluid ounces of coffee equals 64/8 = 8 cups.

3. John buys one jug every 4 days, which means he drinks 8 cups in 4 days. Thus, in one day he drinks 8/4 = 2 cups of coffee.

John buys \( \frac{1}{2} \) gallon of cold brew coffee every 4 days. To find out how much coffee he drinks per day, we need to convert the gallons to cups and then calculate the daily consumption.

First, we need to know how many cups are in a gallon. There are 16 cups in a gallon.

So, \( \frac{1}{2} \) gallon is \( 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \) cups.

He buys this amount every 4 days. Therefore, the amount of coffee he drinks per day is:

\( \frac{8 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ cups/day} \).

Thus, John drinks 2 cups of coffee a day.

To find out how many cups of coffee John drinks per day, we need to first find out how much coffee he drinks in a day, expressed in gallons. 

Given that John buys 1/2 gallon jugs of cold brew coffee every 4 days, we can assume that he drinks 1/2 gallon of coffee every day (since 1/2 gallon is equal to 2 cups of coffee).

Next, we need to convert the gallons into cups. Since there are 8 cups in a gallon, we can calculate the number of cups of coffee John drinks per day as follows:

\( \frac{1/2 \text{ gallon}}{8 \text{ cups/gallon}} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ gallon/cup} \)

So, John drinks \( \frac{1}{16} \) gallon of coffee every day, which is equivalent to \( \frac{1}{8} \) cup of coffee per day.

However, since the question asks for the number of cups of coffee John drinks per day, and we have calculated \( \frac{1}{16} \) gallon per day, we can convert this to cups:

\( \frac{1}{16} \text{ gallon} \times 8 \text{ cups/gallon} = 0.5 \text{ cups} \)

Therefore, John drinks 0.5 cups of coffee per day.

To determine how many cups of coffee John drinks per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert gallons to cups:** 
   - There are 128 cups in a gallon.
   - John buys 1/2 gallon, so he buys \( \frac{1}{2} \times 128 = 64 \) cups of coffee.

2. **Calculate daily consumption:**
   - John buys 64 cups of coffee every 4 days.
   - To find out how many cups he drinks per day, we divide the total number of cups by the number of days: \( \frac{64 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ days}} = 16 \text{ cups/day} \).

So, John drinks 16 cups of coffee per day.
