Frank spent 7 * $1 + 4 * $5 + 2 * $10 + 1 * $20 = $7 + $20 + $20 + $20 = $67 on peanuts. He had $4 in change, so he initially had $67 + $4 = $71. He eats the peanuts over one week, which is 7 days, so he eats $71 / 7 days = $10 per day on average.

Frank has a total of 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 14 $1 bills.
The total amount Frank had before buying peanuts is 14 * $1 + 4 * $5 + 2 * $10 + 1 * $20 = $14 + $20 + $20 + $20 = $74.
He was left with $4 after buying peanuts, meaning he bought 74 - 4 = 70 dollars worth of peanuts.
Since each pound of peanuts costs $3, Frank bought 70 / 3 = 23. 3 pounds of peanuts.
He plans to eat the peanuts all in one week, which is 7 days, so he eats 23. 3 / 7 = 3. 33 pounds of peanuts on average per day.

He has 7*1 + 4*5 + 2*10 + 1*20 = $85 in total.
His change is $4, so he bought 85-4 = 81 dollars worth of peanuts.
Peanuts cost $3 a pound, so he bought 81/3 = 27 pounds of peanuts.
He bought the peanuts in one week, so on average he eats 27/7 = 3.857 pounds per day.

Frank's total amount of money is from the one-dollar bills: \(7 \times 1 = 7\) dollars, from the five-dollar bills: \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars, from the ten-dollar bills: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars, and from the twenty-dollar bill: \(1 \times 20 = 20\) dollars. Adding these up, he has a total of \(7 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 67\) dollars.

Frank buys peanuts for \(67 - 4 = 63\) dollars. Since he buys peanuts for \(63\) dollars at the rate of \(3\) dollars per pound, he buys \(63 \div 3 = 21\) pounds of peanuts. If he plans to eat all 21 pounds of peanuts in one week, he eats \(21 \div 7 = 3\) pounds per day on average.

#### GENERATION 9 RESPONSE ####

First, we calculate the total amount of money Frank has. He has 7 one-dollar bills, 4 five-dollar bills, 2 ten-dollar bills, and 1 twenty-dollar bill. So, the total amount of money is:

\[7 \times 1 + 4 \times 5 + 2 \times 10 + 1 \times 20 = 7 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 67\]

Frank buys peanuts with $67 and has $4 in change. So, the amount he spends on peanuts is:

\[67 - 4 = 63\]

Since peanuts cost $3 per pound, the number of pounds he buys is:

\[\frac{63}{3} = 21\]

Frank plans to eat all the peanuts in one week, which is 7 days. To find out how many pounds he eats on average per day, we divide the total pounds by the number of days:

\[\frac{21}{7} = 3\]

Therefore, he eats 3 pounds of peanuts on average per day.

The total amount Frank has is calculated by summing the value of each type of bill: \(7 \times 1 + 4 \times 5 + 2 \times 10 + 1 \times 20 = 7 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 67\) dollars. He buys peanuts, which cost $3 per pound, and has $4 in change. Therefore, the cost of the peanuts is \(67 - 4 = 63\) dollars. To find out how many pounds of peanuts he buys, we divide the total cost by the price per pound: \(63 / 3 = 21\) pounds. Since he plans to eat all the peanuts in one week, which is 7 days, the average amount he eats per day is \(21 / 7 = 3\) pounds per day.

First, we calculate Frank's total amount of money. He has:
- 7 one-dollar bills, totaling \(7 \times 1 = 7\) dollars
- 4 five-dollar bills, totaling \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars
- 2 ten-dollar bills, totaling \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars
- 1 twenty-dollar bill, totaling \(1 \times 20 = 20\) dollars

Adding these together, Frank has \(7 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 67\) dollars.

Frank buys peanuts that cost $3 a pound and has $4 in change. This means he spends \(67 - 4 = 63\) dollars on peanuts.

Since peanuts cost $3 per pound, the number of pounds he buys is \(\frac{63}{3} = 21\) pounds.

If he eats all of the peanuts in one week, which is 7 days, the average amount he eats per day is \(\frac{21}{7} = 3\) pounds.

The total amount of money Frank has is calculated as follows: \(7 \times \$1 + 4 \times \$5 + 2 \times \$10 + 1 \times \$20 = \$7 + \$20 + \$20 + \$20 = \$67\).

He buys peanuts worth $3 per pound and has $4 in change. Therefore, he spent \( \$67 - \$4 = \$63 \) on peanuts.

The total weight of peanuts he buys can be calculated by dividing the amount spent by the cost per pound: \( \frac{\$63}{\$3/\text{pound}} = 21 \text{ pounds} \).

If he eats all the peanuts in one week, he eats 21 pounds on average per day: \( \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 3 \text{ pounds/day} \).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Frank has. He has:

- 4 five-dollar bills: \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars
- 2 ten-dollar bills: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars

Frank buys peanuts that cost $3 per pound and has $4 in change. Therefore, the amount of money spent on peanuts is:

Since the peanuts cost $3 per pound, the number of pounds of peanuts Frank buys is:
