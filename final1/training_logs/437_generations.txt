To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping compared to his house, we first need to calculate the total amount of rain he experienced during the three days of camping.

The rain amounts were 3 mm, 6 mm, and 5 mm on the three days. Adding these up:

\[ 3 \, \text{mm} + 6 \, \text{mm} + 5 \, \text{mm} = 14 \, \text{mm} \]

Greg experienced 14 mm of rain while camping.

Next, we compare this amount to the amount of rain that fell at his house, which was 26 mm.

To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping, we subtract the amount of rain he experienced from the amount that fell at his house:

\[ 26 \, \text{mm} - 14 \, \text{mm} = 12 \, \text{mm} \]

Therefore, Greg experienced 12 mm less rain while camping compared to his house.

Greg experienced a total of \(3 + 6 + 5 = 14\) mm of rain while camping. At his house, it rained 26 mm during the same week. Thus, Greg experienced \(26 - 14 = 12\) mm less rain while camping.

To determine how much less rain Greg experienced while camping compared to at his house, we first need to calculate the total amount of rain he experienced during his week of camping.

The amounts of rain on the three days were:
- 3 mm
- 6 mm
- 5 mm

We sum these amounts:
\[ 3 + 6 + 5 = 14 \text{ mm} \]

Next, we compare this amount to the total amount of rain at his house, which was 26 mm. To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping, we subtract the camping rain from the house rain:
\[ 26 - 14 = 12 \text{ mm} \]

Therefore, Greg experienced 12 mm less rain while camping compared to at his house.

To determine how much less rain Greg experienced while camping compared to at his house, we first need to calculate the total amount of rain he experienced during his week-long camping trip. 

The rainfall amounts for the three days while camping were 3 mm, 6 mm, and 5 mm. Adding these together:

\[3 + 6 + 5 = 14 \text{ mm}\]

Next, we know that Greg's house received 26 mm of rain during the same week. To find out how much less rain Greg experienced compared to his house, we subtract the camping rainfall amount from the house rainfall amount:

\[26 - 14 = 12 \text{ mm}\]

Therefore, Greg experienced 12 mm less rain while camping compared to his house.

To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping compared to his house, we first need to calculate the total amount of rain he experienced during the camping trip.

The total amount of rain Greg experienced while camping can be calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \, \text{mm} + 6 \, \text{mm} + 5 \, \text{mm} = 14 \, \text{mm} \]

The total amount of rain at Greg's house was 26 mm.

To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping, we subtract the total amount of rain he experienced while camping from the total amount of rain at his house:

\[ 26 \, \text{mm} - 14 \, \text{mm} = 12 \, \text{mm} \]

So, Greg experienced 12 mm less rain while camping compared to his house.

To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping, we need to compare the total amount of rain at his house to the total amount of rain he experienced while camping.

The total amount of rain at his house over the week is 26 mm.

The amount of rain Greg experienced while camping is calculated by summing the rain amounts for the three days: 3 mm + 6 mm + 5 mm = 14 mm.

To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping, we subtract the total amount of rain he experienced while camping from the total amount of rain at his house:

26 mm (house) - 14 mm (camping) = 12 mm

Therefore, Greg experienced 12 mm less rain while camping than he did at his house.
