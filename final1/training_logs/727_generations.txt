First, let's calculate the cost of one pair of jeans. Since a pair of jeans costs twice as much as a shirt, and a shirt costs $10, a pair of jeans will cost $10 * 2 = $20 each.

Next, we need to find out the total earnings from selling shirts. The store sold 20 shirts, and each shirt costs $10. Therefore, the total earnings from shirts will be 20 * $10 = $200.

Now, let's find out the total earnings from selling jeans. The store sold 10 pairs of jeans, and each pair costs $20. Therefore, the total earnings from jeans will be 10 * $20 = $200.

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from shirts and jeans: $200 (from shirts) + $200 (from jeans) = $400.

The clothing store will earn $400 if all shirts and jeans are sold.

First, we need to determine the cost of a pair of jeans. Since a pair of jeans costs twice as much as a shirt, and a shirt costs $10, a pair of jeans costs:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from selling the shirts. Since there are 20 shirts and each sells for $10, the total earnings from the shirts are:
\[ 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total earnings from selling the pairs of jeans. Since there are 10 pairs of jeans and each sells for $20, the total earnings from the jeans are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the earnings from the shirts and the jeans to find the total earnings of the clothing store. Adding these together, we get:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

First, we need to determine the cost of each type of clothing. A shirt is sold for $10, and a pair of jeans is sold for twice as much, which is $20.

Next, we calculate the total earnings from shirts. Since they sell 20 shirts, we multiply the number by the price per shirt: 
\[ 20 \text{ shirts} \times \$10 \text{ per shirt} = \$200 \]

Then, we calculate the total earnings from jeans. They sell 10 pairs of jeans, and each pair costs $20, so:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs of jeans} \times \$20 \text{ per pair} = \$200 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both shirts and jeans to get the total earnings:
\[ \$200 \text{ (from shirts)} + \$200 \text{ (from jeans)} = \$400 \]

Therefore, the total earnings for the clothing store will be $400 if all shirts and jeans are sold.

To determine the total earnings of the clothing store, we need to calculate the earnings from selling shirts and jeans separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings from selling shirts:
- The store sells 20 shirts.
- Each shirt costs $10.
- Therefore, the earnings from shirts is \(20 \times 10 = $200\).

Next, we calculate the earnings from selling jeans:
- The store sells 10 pairs of jeans.
- Each pair of jeans costs twice as much as a shirt, which means each pair costs \(2 \times 10 = $20\).
- Therefore, the earnings from jeans is \(10 \times 20 = $200\).

Now, we add the earnings from shirts and jeans to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = Earnings from shirts + Earnings from jeans
- Total earnings = \(200 + 200 = $400\).

So, the total earnings for the store if all shirts and jeans are sold is $400.

The cost of a pair of jeans is twice the cost of a shirt, so it costs \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars for each pair of jeans. The earnings from selling shirts will be \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) dollars. The earnings from selling jeans will be \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars. Therefore, the total earnings will be \( 200 + 200 = 400 \) dollars.

In this case, the cost of a shirt is calculated as $10. Since a pair of jeans costs twice as much, that means the cost of a pair of jeans is $10 * 2 = $20.

If a total of 20 shirts are sold, then the income from selling the shirts is 20 shirts * $10 = $200. 

For the 10 pairs of jeans, this means that the income from selling the jeans is 10 pairs of jeans * $20 = $200 total.

When each of these earnings is added, the total income from all sales is $200 + $200 = $400.

Let's calculate the earnings from each type of clothing:

1. Cost of a shirt: $10
2. Cost of jeans: twice as much as a shirt = 2 * $10 = $20

The store sells all the shirts and jeans, so:
- Earnings from shirts: 20 shirts * $10/shirt = $200
- Earnings from jeans: 10 pairs of jeans * $20/pair = $200

Total earnings: $200 (from shirts) + $200 (from jeans) = $400

First, we calculate the cost of a pair of jeans, which is double the cost of a shirt. The cost of a shirt is $10, so the cost of a pair of jeans is 2 * $10 = $20.

The store sells 20 shirts for $10 each, so the total earnings from selling shirts is 20 * $10 = $200.

The store also sells 10 pairs of jeans for $20 each, so the total earnings from selling jeans is 10 * $20 = $200.

To find the total earnings from selling all shirts and jeans, we add the earnings from shirts and jeans: $200 + $200 = $400.

Therefore, the clothing store will earn $400 if all shirts and jeans are sold.

To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of socks sold by the price of each type of sock, and then sum the results.

The earnings from selling shirts are 20 × $10 = $200. The earnings from selling socks are 10 × (2 × $10) = $200.

Therefore, the total earnings are $200 + $200 = $400.

Each shirt costs $10, and the store sells 20 shirts. Therefore, the total earnings from the shirts are:
\[ 20 \, \text{shirts} \times \$10/\text{shirt} = \$200 \]

Each pair of jeans costs twice as much as a shirt, which is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]
The store sells 10 pairs of jeans. Therefore, the total earnings from the jeans are:
\[ 10 \, \text{pairs of jeans} \times \$20/\text{pair} = \$200 \]

To find the total earnings from selling all the shirts and jeans, we add the earnings from the shirts and the earnings from the jeans:
\[ \$200 + \$200 = \$400 \]

Thus, the store will earn $400 if all shirts and jeans are sold.
