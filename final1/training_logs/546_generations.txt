To find out the total time Tom spent renovating the house, we need to calculate the time for each room's renovation and then sum them up.

1. Time to renovate a bedroom is 4 hours.
2. Kitchen renovation time is 50% longer than a bedroom, so:
   \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) hours

3. Time to renovate the living room is twice the combined time of all other rooms (bedrooms and kitchen):
   Combined time for bedrooms and kitchen: \(4 + 6 = 10\) hours
   \(2 \times 10 = 20\) hours

4. Time to renovate all rooms: \(4 + 6 + 20 = 30\) hours

However, the kitchen renovation time was mistakenly stated as 2 hours instead of 6 hours. Let's correct this:

1. Time to renovate a bedroom is 4 hours.
2. Kitchen renovation time is 50% longer than a bedroom, so:
   \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) hours (this time was actually longer, not shorter)

3. Time to renovate the living room is twice the combined time of all other rooms (bedrooms and kitchen):
   Combined time for bedrooms and kitchen: \(4 + 6 = 10\) hours
   \(2 \times 10 = 20\) hours

4. Time to renovate all rooms: \(4 + 6 + 20 = 30\) hours

Since the kitchen renovation time was mistakenly stated as 2 hours instead of 6 hours, we can correct the calculation for the kitchen renovation time:

Time to renovate the kitchen should be: \(6\) hours (correct initial calculation)
Then, the corrected calculations should be:

Correct kitchen renovation time: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) hours
Combined time for bedrooms and kitchen: \(4 + 6 = 10\) hours
\(2 \times 10 = 20\) hours
Total renovation time: \(4 + 6 + 20 = 30\) hours

Therefore, the total time to renovate the rooms is 30 hours.

Each bedroom takes 4 hours to renovate, so 3 bedrooms total take \(3 \times 4 = 12\) hours.
The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom, so it takes \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) hours.
Everything else combined takes \(12 + 6 = 18\) hours.
The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined, so it took \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hours.
In total, everything took \(12 + 6 + 36 = 54\) hours.

To calculate the time taken for each part of the renovation, we'll start with the bedrooms and then add the time for the kitchen and the living room, adjusting for the given proportions.

1. **Bedrooms:**
   There are 3 bedrooms, each taking 4 hours to renovate.
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Kitchen:**
   The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom. Since each bedroom takes 4 hours:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \times 4 \text{ hours} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   So, the kitchen takes 6 hours.

3. **Living Room:**
   The living room takes twice as much time as everything else combined. First, we calculate the total time for the bedrooms and the kitchen:
   \[
   12 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Then, we multiply this total by 2:
   \[
   18 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours}
   \]
   So, the living room takes 36 hours.

4. **Total time:**
   Finally, we add the time for the bedrooms, the kitchen, and the living room:
   \[
   12 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 36 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the total time taken for everything is 54 hours.

First, let's calculate the total time it takes to renovate the bedrooms, which are three bedrooms each taking 4 hours to renovate. This is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) hours.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to renovate the kitchen. It takes 50% longer than each bedroom renovation, so \(12 \times 1.5 = 18\) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time for renovating everything except the living room. This is the sum of the bedroom renovations and the kitchen renovation, which is \(12 + 18 = 30\) hours.

Since the living room took twice as much time as everything else combined, it took \(30 \times 2 = 60\) hours.

Finally, to find the total time, we add the time for everything together, which is \(60 + 12 + 18 = 90\) hours.

The time taken to renovate each bedroom is 4 hours. 
The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom, so it takes 4 hours + (50/100 * 4 hours) = 4 + 2 = 6 hours. 

The total time for the bedrooms and kitchen combined is 3 bedrooms * 4 hours/bedroom + 6 hours/kitchen = 12 + 6 = 18 hours. 

The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined, so it took 2 * 18 hours = 36 hours. 

Therefore, the total time for everything is 18 hours + 36 hours = 54 hours.

To find out how long everything took, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the renovation and then sum them up. Let's start with the bedrooms.

1 Bedroom renovation time: 4 hours
Since there are 3 bedrooms, the total time for the bedrooms is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the time for the kitchen. The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we find out the total time for the bedrooms and the kitchen combined:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the time for the living room. The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined:
\[ 18 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Adding up the time for the bedrooms, kitchen, and living room, we get:
\[ 36 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the renovation is 36 hours.

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, calculate the time taken to renovate each bedroom:

   There are 3 bedrooms and each takes 4 hours. So:

   \[
   \text{Time per bedroom} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Now, calculate the time taken to renovate the kitchen:

   The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom. 

   \[
   \text{Time for kitchen} = 4 \text{ hours} + (0.5 \times 4 \text{ hours}) = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Calculate the total time taken for the bedrooms and the kitchen:

   Since there are 3 bedrooms, the total time for bedrooms is:

   \[
   \text{Total time for 3 bedrooms} = 3 \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Adding the kitchen time:

   \[
   \text{Total time for kitchen} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Now add the total time for bedrooms and the kitchen:

   \[
   \text{Total time for bedrooms and kitchen} = 12 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Determine the time taken for the living room:

   The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined, so:

   \[
   \text{Time for living room} = 2 \times 18 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. Finally, sum up the time for all areas:

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for bedrooms} + \text{Time for kitchen} + \text{Time for living room} = 12 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 36 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time Tom spent renovating the house was 54 hours.

First, let's calculate the time taken to renovate each bedroom. Since each bedroom takes 4 hours, there are 3 bedrooms, and each takes 4 hours, the total time for the bedrooms is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) hours.

Next, we calculate the time taken for the kitchen. We know the kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom, which means \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) hours.

Now we sum up the time for the bedrooms, the kitchen, and then add the time for the living room, which took twice as much as the combined total of the bedrooms and kitchen. So, the total time for the bedrooms and kitchen is \(12 + 6 = 18\) hours. 

The time for the living room is twice this amount, so \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hours.

Finally, we add all the times together: \(12\) (bedrooms) \(+ 6\) (kitchen) \(+ 36\) (living room) \(= 54\) hours.

Therefore, the total time everything took is \(54\) hours.

The time to renovate each bedroom is 4 hours, so the total time for the bedrooms is 3 bedrooms * 4 hours/bedroom = 12 hours.

The kitchen takes 50% longer, which means it takes 4 hours * 1.5 = 6 hours.

The combined time for the bedrooms and the kitchen is 12 hours + 6 hours = 18 hours.

The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined, so it took 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours.

The total time for everything is 12 hours (bedrooms) + 6 hours (kitchen) + 36 hours (living room) = 54 hours.

To calculate the total time it took to renovate the house, we can break it down into the individual tasks and their respective times.

1. **Bedroom Renovation Time**:
   Each bedroom takes 4 hours to renovate.
   There are 3 bedrooms.

   Total time for bedrooms = 4 hours/bedroom × 3 bedrooms = 12 hours

2. **Kitchen Renovation Time**:
   The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom, which means it takes 1.5 times as long as a bedroom.
   Kitchen time = 4 hours × 1.5 = 6 hours

3. **Combined Time for Bedrooms and Kitchen**:
   Total time for bedrooms and kitchen = 12 hours (bedrooms) + 6 hours (kitchen) = 18 hours

4. **Living Room Renovation Time**:
   The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined before the kitchen.
   Living room time = 2 × (18 hours) = 36 hours

5. **Total Renovation Time**:
   Total renovation time = Time for bedrooms + Time for kitchen + Time for living room
   Total renovation time = 12 hours + 6 hours + 36 hours = 54 hours

Therefore, the total time taken to renovate the house is 54 hours.
