First, let's calculate the total number of beads used for the necklaces:
- On Monday, Kylie makes 10 necklaces, so she uses \(10 \times 20 = 200\) beads.
- On Tuesday, Kylie makes 2 necklaces, so she uses \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.
- In total, for the necklaces, Kylie uses \(200 + 40 = 240\) beads.

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads used for the bracelets:
- Kylie makes 5 bracelets, so she uses \(5 \times 10 = 50\) beads.

Then, let's calculate the total number of beads used for the earrings:
- Kylie makes 7 earrings, so she uses \(7 \times 5 = 35\) beads.

To find the total number of beads used, we add the beads used for the necklaces, bracelets, and earrings together:
- Total beads used = beads for necklaces + beads for bracelets + beads for earrings
- Total beads used = 240 + 50 + 35 = 325 beads.

Therefore, Kylie uses a total of 325 beads to make her jewelry.

To find out how many beads Kylie uses in total, we need to calculate the number of beads used for necklaces, bracelets, and earrings separately, and then sum them up.

First, calculate the number of beads used for necklaces:
- On Monday, Kylie makes 10 beaded necklaces, so she uses \(10 \times 20 = 200\) beads.
- On Tuesday, she makes 2 beaded necklaces, so she uses \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.
- In total, for necklaces, she uses \(200 + 40 = 240\) beads.

Next, calculate the number of beads used for bracelets:
- She makes 5 beaded bracelets, so she uses \(5 \times 10 = 50\) beads.

Then, calculate the number of beads used for earrings:
- She makes 7 beaded earrings, so she uses \(7 \times 5 = 35\) beads.

Finally, sum up all the beads used:
- Total beads used = beads for necklaces + beads for bracelets + beads for earrings
- Total beads used = \(240 + 50 + 35 = 325\).

So, Kylie uses 325 beads in total to make her jewelry.

First, let's calculate the number of beads used for the necklaces made on Monday and Tuesday:
- Necklaces made on Monday: 10 necklaces x 20 beads/necklace = 200 beads
- Necklaces made on Tuesday: 2 necklaces x 20 beads/necklace = 40 beads
Total beads for necklaces = 200 beads + 40 beads = 240 beads

Next, let's calculate the number of beads used for the bracelets made on Wednesday:
- Bracelets made on Wednesday: 5 bracelets x 10 beads/bracelet = 50 beads

Finally, let's calculate the number of beads used for the earrings made on Wednesday:
- Earrings made on Wednesday: 7 earrings x 5 beads/earring = 35 beads

Total beads used = Necklaces + Bracelets + Earrings
= 240 beads + 50 beads + 35 beads

To determine the total number of beads Kylie uses, we need to calculate the beads used for each type of jewelry separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the beads used for the necklaces:
- On Monday, Kylie makes 10 necklaces.
- On Tuesday, Kylie makes 2 necklaces.

Total necklaces on Monday and Tuesday = 10 + 2 = 12 necklaces.
Since 20 beads are needed for one necklace, the total beads used for necklaces = 12 necklaces * 20 beads/necklace = 240 beads.

Next, let's calculate the beads used for the bracelets:
- On Wednesday, Kylie makes 5 bracelets.

Since 10 beads are needed for one bracelet, the total beads used for bracelets = 5 bracelets * 10 beads/bracelet = 50 beads.

Finally, let's calculate the beads used for the earrings:
- On Wednesday, Kylie makes 7 earrings.

Since 5 beads are needed for one earring, the total beads used for earrings = 7 earrings * 5 beads/earring = 35 beads.

Now, let's sum the beads used for all types of jewelry:
Total beads used = beads for necklaces + beads for bracelets + beads for earrings = 240 + 50 + 35 = 325 beads.

Therefore, Kylie uses a total of 325 beads to make her jewelry.

First, we need to calculate the total number of beads used for the beaded necklaces. Kylie makes 10 necklaces on Monday and 2 necklaces on Tuesday, so the total for necklaces is \(10 + 2 = 12\) necklaces. Given that each necklace requires 20 beads, the total number of beads used for necklaces is \(12 \times 20 = 240\) beads.

Next, we calculate the total number of beads used for the beaded bracelets. Kylie makes 5 bracelets on Wednesday, and each bracelet requires 10 beads, so the total number of beads used for bracelets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) beads.

Finally, we calculate the total number of beads used for the beaded earrings. Kylie makes 7 earrings on Wednesday, and each earring requires 5 beads, so the total number of beads used for earrings is \(7 \times 5 = 35\) beads.

To find the total number of beads used, we add the beads used for necklaces, bracelets, and earrings: \(240 + 50 + 35 = 325\) beads.

Let's confirm with the calculations:
- Beads for necklaces: \(12 \times 20 = 240\)
- Beads for bracelets: \(5 \times 10 = 50\)
- Beads for earrings: \(7 \times 5 = 35\)

Summing these up: \(240 + 50 + 35 = 325\) beads.

So, the total number of beads Kylie uses is 325.

To determine how many beads Kylie uses in total to make her jewelry, we need to calculate the number of beads used for each type of jewelry and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of beads used for the beaded necklaces:
- Kylie makes 10 beaded necklaces on Monday.
- For Monday, the number of beads needed is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) beads (since 20 beads are needed to make one beaded necklace).

Next, we calculate the number of beads used for the beaded necklaces on Tuesday:
- Kylie makes 2 beaded necklaces on Tuesday.
- For Tuesday, the number of beads needed is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Then, we calculate the number of beads used for the beaded bracelets:
- Kylie makes 5 beaded bracelets on Wednesday.
- For Wednesday, the number of beads needed is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) beads.

Next, we calculate the number of beads used for the beaded earrings:
- Kylie makes 7 beaded earrings on Wednesday.
- For Wednesday, the number of beads needed is \(7 \times 5 = 35\) beads.

Finally, we sum up the beads used for all the jewelry:
- Total beads from necklaces on Monday = 200 beads.
- Total beads from necklaces on Tuesday = 40 beads.
- Total beads from bracelets = 50 beads.
- Total beads from earrings = 35 beads.

The total number of beads used is:
\[ 200 + 40 + 50 + 35 = 325 \]

Therefore, Kylie uses a total of 325 beads to make her jewelry.

On Wednesday, she makes 5 bracelets and 7 earrings, which totals to 12 pieces. Each bracelet requires 10 beads, so the beads used for bracelets are \(12 \times 10 = 120\) beads. Each earring requires 5 beads, so the beads used for earrings are \(12 \times 5 = 60\) beads. 

Adding up all the beads used: \(240\) beads (for necklaces) \(+ 120\) beads (for bracelets) \(+ 60\) beads (for earrings) \(= 420\) beads.

To find out the total number of beads Kylie uses, we need to calculate the beads used for necklaces, bracelets, and earrings separately, and then add these amounts together.

For necklaces:
- On Monday, she makes 10 necklaces.
- On Tuesday, she makes 2 necklaces.
So, for necklaces, she makes a total of (10 + 2) = 12 necklaces.

For bracelets:
- On Wednesday, she makes 5 bracelets.

For earrings:
- 7 earrings are made on Wednesday.

Now, we calculate the beads used for each:
- Beads used for necklaces = 10 necklaces * 20 beads/necklace = 200 beads.
- Beads used for bracelets = 5 bracelets * 10 beads/bracelet = 50 beads.
- Beads used for earrings = 7 earrings * 5 beads/earring = 35 beads.

Adding these up:
Total beads used = beads for necklaces + beads for bracelets + beads for earrings
Total beads used = 200 (necklaces) + 50 (bracelets) + 35 (earrings)
Total beads used = 200 + 50 + 35 = 285 beads.

Therefore, Kylie uses 285 beads in total to make her jewelry.

Kylie makes 10 beaded necklaces on Monday and 2 beaded necklaces on Tuesday, making a total of 10 + 2 = 12 necklaces. 

We also know that 20 beads are needed to make one beaded necklace, so for 12 necklaces, Kylie uses a total of 12 x 20 = 240 beads.

On Wednesday, Kylie makes 5 beaded bracelets and 7 beaded earrings. This makes a total of 5 + 7 = 12 jewelry items on Wednesday.

Since 10 beads are needed to make one beaded bracelet, for 5 bracelets Kylie uses a total of 5 x 10 = 50 beads. For 7 beaded earrings, 5 beads are needed for each one, making a total of 7 x 5 = 35 beads.

In total, Kylie uses 12 beaded bracelets (50 beads) + 7 beaded earrings (35 beads) = 85 beads for Wednesday’s jewelry.

In summary, Kylie uses a total of 240 beads for necklaces + 85 beads for jewelry = 325 beads in total.

Total beads for earrings = 7 earrings * 5 beads/earring = 35 beads

Now, we add up all the beads used:
