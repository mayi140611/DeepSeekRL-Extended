<reasoning>
First, let's calculate the amount deducted as tax. 10% of $500 is $50. 

Next, we calculate the tithe, which is 10% of $500, so it is also $50.

Now, we sum the deductions for tax and tithe, totaling $100.

Next, we subtract these total deductions from Alex's weekly income of $500, giving $400 remaining.

Finally, we subtract his weekly water bill of $55 from his remaining amount, leaving him with $345.

Therefore, Alex has $345 left.

First, we need to calculate the tax Alex has to pay. Since he gets paid $500 and 10% is deducted as tax, the tax amount is:
\[ \text{Tax} = 0.10 \times 500 = 50 \]

Next, the water bill is $55, so we subtract this from his weekly income:
\[ \text{Weekly Income After Water Bill} = 500 - 55 = 445 \]

Then, he donates 10% of his weekly income as a tithe. The tithe amount is:
\[ \text{Tithe} = 0.10 \times 500 = 50 \]

Now we subtract the tithe from his weekly income after the water bill:
\[ \text{Final Amount} = 445 - 50 = 395 \]

So, Alex has $395 left.

To determine how much money Alex has left, we need to calculate the amount deducted for tax, tithe, and water bill, and then subtract these from his weekly income. 

1. **Tax Deduction:** 10% of $500.
   - Tax = \( 0.10 \times 500 = 50 \)

2. **Tithe Deduction:** 10% of $500.
   - Tithe = \( 0.10 \times 500 = 50 \)

3. **Water Bill:** $55

Now, sum up all the deductions:
   - Total deductions = Tax + Tithe + Water Bill = \( 50 + 50 + 55 = 155 \)

4. Subtract the total deductions from his weekly income to find out how much money Alex has left.
   - Money left = Weekly income - Total deductions = \( 500 - 155 = 345 \)

Therefore, Alex has $345 left.

Alex earns $500 a week. 
Out of his weekly income, 10% is deducted as tax, which is $500 * 10% = $50.
He pays a weekly water bill of $55.
Alex gives away an additional 10% of his weekly income as a tithe, which is $500 * 10% = $50.
Now, let's calculate the total deductions and the remaining income Alex has after all these expenses. 

The total deductions add up to $50 (tax) + $55 (water bill) + $50 (tithe) = $155. 

So, the remaining income is $500 - $155 = $345.

To determine how much money Alex has left after deductions, we need to account for each of the deductions he makes from his weekly income.

1. **Income Deducted as Tax:**
   - Alex gets paid $500 per week.
   - 10% of his weekly income is deducted as tax.
   - Tax deduction = 10% of $500 = \( 0.10 \times 500 = $50 \).

2. **Water Bill:**
   - Alex pays a weekly water bill for $55.

3. **Tithe:**
   - Alex gives away another 10% of his weekly income as a tithe.
   - Tithe amount = 10% of $500 = \( 0.10 \times 500 = $50 \).

To find the total deductions, we add up the tax deduction, water bill, and tithe:

- Total deductions = $50 (tax) + $55 (water bill) + $50 (tithe) = $155.

Now, to determine how much money Alex has left, we subtract the total deductions from his weekly income:

- Weekly income = $500.
- Amount left = Weekly income - Total deductions = $500 - $155 = $345.

Therefore, Alex has $345 left after all deductions.

To determine how much money Alex has left, we need to calculate the deductions step by step.

1. **Weekly income:**
   - Alex's weekly income is $500.

2. **Tax deduction:**
   - 10% of $500 is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Tax} = 0.10 \times 500 = 50
     \]
   - So, $500 - $50 = $450 is left after tax.

3. **Water bill:**
   - The water bill is $55.
   - $450 - $55 = $395 is left after paying the water bill.

4. **Tithe (10% of income):**
   - 10% of $500 is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Tithe} = 0.10 \times 500 = 50
     \]
   - So, $395 - $50 = $345 is left after paying the tithe.

Therefore, Alex has $345 left after all deductions.

To determine how much money Alex has left after deductions, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the tax deduction:**
   Alex earns $500 per week. 10% of his weekly income is deducted as tax.
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 0.10 \times 500 = 50
   \]
   So, he pays $50 in taxes.

2. **Calculate the water bill:**
   Alex pays $55 for his weekly water bill.

3. **Calculate the tithe:**
   10% of his weekly income is given as a tithe.
   \[
   \text{Tithe} = 0.10 \times 500 = 50
   \]
   So, he gives $50 as a tithe.

Next, we calculate the total deductions:
- Tax: $50
- Water bill: $55
- Tithe: $50

\[
\text{Total deductions} = 50 + 55 + 50 = 155
\]

Finally, we subtract the total deductions from Alex's weekly income to find out how much money he has left:
\[
\text{Money left} = 500 - 155 = 345
\]

So, Alex has $345 left each week.

To determine how much money Alex has left, we need to calculate his total weekly expenses and subtract them from his weekly income.

1. Alex's weekly income is $500.
2. 10% of his income is deducted as tax, which amounts to $500 * 10% = $50.
3. His weekly water bill is $55.
4. Another 10% of his income is given as a tithe, which amounts to $500 * 10% = $50.

Now we add up all these expenses to find the total amount deducted:
- Tax: $50
- Water bill: $55
- Tithe: $50

Total deductions = $50 + $55 + $50 = $155

Next, we subtract the total deductions from Alex's weekly income to find out how much money he has left:
$500 - $155 = $345

So, Alex has $345 left after all deductions.

To determine how much money Alex has left, we need to calculate the deductions from his weekly income and subtract them from his weekly pay.

1. **Tax Deduction**: 
   - Alex gets paid $500 a week and 10% of this income is deducted as tax.
   - Tax amount = 10% of $500 = \( 0.10 \times 500 = $50 \).

2. **Water Bill**:
   - Alex has to pay a weekly water bill of $55.

3. **Tithe**:
   - Alex gives away another 10% of his weekly income as a tithe.
   - Tithe amount = 10% of $500 = \( 0.10 \times 500 = $50 \).

Now, sum up all the deductions:
   - Total deductions = Tax + Water Bill + Tithe
   - Total deductions = $50 + $55 + $50 = $155.

4. Subtract the total deductions from Alex's weekly pay to find the amount left:
   - Amount left = Weekly pay - Total deductions
   - Amount left = $500 - $155 = $345

So, Alex has $345 left after all deductions.

First, let's determine the total deductions Alex receives on a weekly basis. Alex gets paid $500 a week and 10% of his weekly income is deducted as tax. So his tax deduction is $500 * 0.10 = $50. 

Additionally, Alex pays his weekly water bill of $55. He also gives away 10% of his weekly income as a tithe. His tithe deduction is $500 * 0.10 = $50.

To find the total deductions, we add up the tax and the water bill, which total $500 * 0.10 = $65. We also add the tithe deduction, which is $50. So, the total deductions Alex receives on a weekly basis is $500 + $65 + $50 = $615.

Now, to determine how much money Alex has left after paying his deductions, we subtract the total deductions from his weekly income. Alex's weekly income is $500, and his deductions total $615. Therefore, the remaining amount is $500 - $615 = -$115.

This negative figure indicates that Alex has a shortage and he has $115 less than his initial weekly income. Therefore, he still owes this amount.
