<reasoning>
Each of the 5 squirrels collected 575 acorns, which means there are a total of 5 * 575 = 2875 acorns. To find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs, we need to determine the total number of acorns needed and subtract the number of acorns already collected. Since each squirrel needs 130 acorns, the total number of acorns needed for all squirrels is 5 * 130 = 650. Therefore, each squirrel needs to collect an additional 650 - 575 = 75 acorns. 

So, each squirrel needs to collect 75 more acorns.

Each squirrel needs a total of 130 acorns for winter. With 5 squirrels having collected 575 acorns, we need to calculate the total number of acorns collected by all squirrels to see if they have enough. If not, we need to find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs.

First, let's find out how many acorns are needed for all 5 squirrels:
\[ 5 \text{ squirrels} \times 130 \text{ acorns per squirrel} = 650 \text{ acorns} \]

Next, we compare the total acorns collected (575) to the total acorns needed (650):
\[ 650 \text{ acorns needed} - 575 \text{ acorns collected} = 75 \text{ acorns short} \]

Since there are 5 squirrels, each squirrel needs to collect an additional:
\[ \frac{75 \text{ acorns}}{5 \text{ squirrels}} = 15 \text{ acorns per squirrel} \]

Therefore, each squirrel needs to collect 15 more acorns.

First, we need to calculate the total number of acorns required for all 5 squirrels to get through the winter. Since each squirrel needs 130 acorns, the total number of acorns needed is \( 5 \times 130 = 650 \) acorns.

Next, we find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs by subtracting the number of acorns they already have from the total number of acorns needed. The total number of acorns they already have is the total collected, which is 575 acorns.

So, each squirrel needs \( 650 - 575 = 75 \) more acorns to get through the winter.

To find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs to collect, we first determine the total number of acorns each squirrel currently has. Since there are 5 squirrels and they collected a total of 575 acorns, each squirrel has:

\[ \frac{575}{5} = 115 \text{ acorns} \]

Each squirrel needs 130 acorns to get through the winter. Since each squirrel currently has 115 acorns, the difference is:

\[ 130 - 115 = 15 \text{ acorns} \]

So, each squirrel needs to collect 15 more acorns.

To determine how many more acorns each squirrel needs to collect, we start by calculating how many acorns are currently available and how many more are needed for each squirrel.

First, find out how many more acorns are needed in total:
\[ 575 \text{ acorns needed} - 575 \text{ acorns collected} = 0 \text{ acorns needed} \]

Since there are 5 squirrels and each squirrel needs 130 acorns:
\[ 5 \text{ squirrels} \times 130 \text{ acorns per squirrel} = 650 \text{ acorns total needed} \]

Since all 575 acorns have already been collected:
\[ 650 \text{ acorns total needed} - 575 \text{ acorns collected} = 75 \text{ acorns leftover} \]

Each squirrel initially had 0 acorns, so:
\[ 75 \text{ acorns leftover} \div 5 \text{ squirrels} = 15 \text{ acorns per squirrel needed} \]

Each squirrel needs 130 acorns, and 115 acorns were collected, so each squirrel needs to collect:
\[ 130 \text{ acorns needed by each squirrel} - 115 \text{ acorns collected} = 15 \text{ acorns more per squirrel} \]

First, we need to determine the total number of acorns each squirrel still needs to collect. Each squirrel needs 130 acorns, and there are 5 squirrels in total. So, the total number of acorns needed is 5 squirrels * 130 acorns/squirrel = 650 acorns.

The squirrels have already collected 575 acorns. To find out how many more acorns they need in total, we subtract the number of acorns they have from the total needed: 650 acorns - 575 acorns = 75 acorns.

Since there are 5 squirrels, to find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs to collect, we divide the total number of additional acorns needed by the number of squirrels: 75 acorns / 5 squirrels = 15 acorns/squirrel.

Therefore, each squirrel needs to collect an additional 15 acorns.

First, we need to find out how many acorns each squirrel currently has. Since there are 5 squirrels and they all collected 575 acorns in total, we divide 575 by 5: 575 / 5 = 115 acorns per squirrel.

However, each squirrel needs 130 acorns to get through the winter. Since each squirrel currently has 115 acorns, we need to find out how many more acorns they need individually: 130 - 115 = 15 acorns per squirrel.

The answer is 15 acorns per squirrel.

Each squirrel needs 130 acorns to get through the winter. The total number of acorns collected by the squirrels is 575.

Since 575 acorns have already been collected, these 75 acorns are distributed among the 5 squirrels. To find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs, we divide the total extra acorns by the number of squirrels:
\[ \frac{75}{5} = 15 \text{ acorns per squirrel} \]

Therefore, each squirrel needs to collect an additional 15 acorns.

To determine how many more acorns each squirrel needs to collect, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of acorns each squirrel needs to have to get through the winter.
2. Compare this amount to the number of acorns each squirrel currently has.
3. Find the difference between the required number and the current number of acorns.

First, we know that each squirrel needs 130 acorns. Since there are 5 squirrels, the total number of acorns needed for all squirrels to have enough for the winter is:
\[ 130 \text{ acorns/squirrel} \times 5 \text{ squirrels} = 650 \text{ acorns} \]

Next, we know that each squirrel currently has 575 acorns. To find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs, we subtract the number of acorns each squirrel currently has from the total number of acorns needed:
\[ 650 \text{ acorns} - 575 \text{ acorns} = 75 \text{ acorns} \]

Therefore, each squirrel needs to collect 75 more acorns.

To find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs to collect, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many acorns are needed in total for all squirrels to make it through the winter.
2. Find out how many additional acorns each squirrel needs by subtracting the number of acorns they've already collected from the total needed.

First, calculate the total number of acorns needed for all squirrels:
\[ \text{Total acorns needed} = \text{Number of squirrels} \times \text{Acorns per squirrel} \]
\[ \text{Total acorns needed} = 5 \times 130 = 650 \]

Next, find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs by subtracting the acorns they have from the total acorns needed:
\[ \text{Additional acorns needed per squirrel} = \text{Total acorns needed} - \text{Acorns collected by each squirrel} \]
\[ \text{Additional acorns needed per squirrel} = 650 - 575 \]
\[ \text{Additional acorns needed per squirrel} = 75 \]

So, each squirrel needs to collect 75 more acorns to meet their winter needs.

To determine how many more acorns each squirrel needs to collect, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of acorns needed for all squirrels combined.
2. Determine the total number of acorns already collected by the squirrels.
3. Find out how many more acorns are needed by subtracting the total acorns already collected from the total acorns needed.
4. Divide the remaining number of acorns by the number of squirrels to find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs to collect.

Let's do this step by step:

1. Total acorns needed for all squirrels: \( 5 \text{ squirrels} \times 130 \text{ acorns/squirrel} = 650 \text{ acorns} \)

2. Acorns already collected: \( 575 \text{ acorns} \)

3. Acorns still needed: \( 650 \text{ acorns} - 575 \text{ acorns} = 75 \text{ acorns} \)

4. Acorns each squirrel needs to collect: \( \frac{75 \text{ acorns}}{5 \text{ squirrels}} = 15 \text{ acorns/squirrel} \)

So, each squirrel needs to collect an additional 15 acorns to meet the total requirement.

1. Calculate the total number of acorns needed for all squirrels to get through the winter.
2. Determine the total number of acorns already collected.
3. Subtract the total number of acorns collected from the total number needed to find out how many more acorns are required.
4. Divide this difference by the number of squirrels to find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs to collect.

Let's go through each step:

1. Total acorns needed = 130 acorns/squirrel * 5 squirrels = 650 acorns
2. Total acorns collected = 575 acorns
3. Acorns needed to collect = Total acorns needed - Total acorns collected = 650 acorns - 575 acorns = 75 acorns
4. Acorns needed per squirrel = 75 acorns / 5 squirrels = 15 acorns

Therefore, each squirrel needs to collect an additional 15 acorns.

Each squirrel needs a total of 130 acorns. Since there are 5 squirrels, they collectively have 575 acorns. To find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs, we first need to calculate the total number of acorns each squirrel would need if they shared equally. This would be 130 acorns divided by the number of squirrels, which is 5. Then we subtract the number of acorns they already have (575) from the total required for each squirrel to find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs. 

The calculation is as follows:
Total acorns each squirrel needs = 130
Total acorns already collected by all squirrels = 575
Acorns needed per squirrel = 130 - (575/5)

Now let's calculate:
Acorns needed per squirrel = 130 - 115 = 15

Each squirrel needs to collect an additional 15 acorns.
