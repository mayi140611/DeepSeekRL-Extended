###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

It's Ava's birthday party. Her parents bought a unicorn piñata for $13 and filled it with all of her favorite treats. They bought 4 bags of Reese's for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag. How much did the unicorn piñata and the treats cost altogether?

reasoner
To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the treats and the piñata separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the treats:

- Reese's: 4 bags at $9 per bag = 4 * $9 = $36
- Snickers: 3 bags at $5 per bag = 3 * $5 = $15
- Skittles: 5 bags at $7 per bag = 5 * $7 = $35

Now, let's add up the costs of the treats: $36 + $15 + $35 = $86

Next, let's add the cost of the unicorn piñata: $13

Now, add the cost of the piñata to the cost of the treats: $13 + $86 = $99

Therefore, the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats altogether is $99.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the unicorn piñata, the Reese's, the Snickers, and the Skittles.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the treats:
- Reese's: 4 bags × $9/bag = $36
- Snickers: 3 bags × $5/bag = $15
- Skittles: 5 bags × $7/bag = $35

Now, let's add up the cost of the Reese's, Snickers, and Skittles to get the total for the treats:
$36 + $15 + $35 = $86

Now, let's add the cost of the unicorn piñata:
$86 + $13 = $99

So, the unicorn piñata and the treats together cost $99.

The cost of the Reese's is 4 × 9 = $36.
The cost of the Snickers is 3 × 5 = $15.
The cost of the Skittles is 5 × 7 = $35.
In total, the unicorn piñata and the treats cost 13 + 36 + 15 + 35 = $99.
Therefore, the answer is 99.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the unicorn piñata and the cost of the treats separately, and then add them together.

Cost of the unicorn piñata = $13

Cost of Reese's = 4 bags * $9 per bag = $36

Cost of Snickers = 3 bags * $5 per bag = $15

Cost of Skittles = 5 bags * $7 per bag = $35

Total cost of treats = Cost of Reese's + Cost of Snickers + Cost of Skittles
Total cost of treats = $36 + $15 + $35 = $86

Total cost = Cost of the piñata + Total cost of treats
Total cost = $13 + $86 = $99

Therefore, the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats is $99.

To find out the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats, we need to add the cost of the piñata and the cost of all the treats together.

The cost of the unicorn piñata is $13.

The cost of 4 bags of Reese's is 4 * $9 = $36.
The cost of 3 bags of Snickers is 3 * $5 = $15.
The cost of 5 bags of Skittles is 5 * $7 = $35.

Now we add all the costs together:

$13 (piñata) + $36 (Reese's) + $15 (Snickers) + $35 (Skittles) = $99

So the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats is $99.

For the Snickers, the cost is 3 bags * $5/bag = $15.
For the Skittles, the cost is 5 bags * $7/bag = $35.

Now, let's add up the cost of the piñata and the treats:

 cost of the piñata = $13
 cost of the treats = $36 + $15 + $35 = $86

Total cost = cost of the piñata + cost of the treats = $13 + $86 = $99.

To find out the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the unicorn piñata first, and then add the cost of the treats.

1. The cost of the unicorn piñata is $13.

2. The cost of the Reese's is calculated by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag: 4 bags * $9/bag = $36.

3. The cost of the Snickers is calculated by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag: 3 bags * $5/bag = $15.

4. The cost of the Skittles is calculated by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag: 5 bags * $7/bag = $35.

5. Now, let's add up all the costs:
   Cost of the unicorn piñata + Cost of Reese's + Cost of Snickers + Cost of Skittles = $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99.

Therefore, the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats is $99.

To find the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats, we need to add the cost of each item together.

1. **Cost of the unicorn piñata**: The piñata costs $13.
2. **Cost of Reese's**: There are 4 bags at $9 per bag, so the total cost is \(4 \times 9 = 36\) dollars.
3. **Cost of Snickers**: There are 3 bags at $5 per bag, so the total cost is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
4. **Cost of Skittles**: There are 5 bags at $7 per bag, so the total cost is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) dollars.

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[
13 + 36 + 15 + 35 = 100

To determine the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. Cost of the unicorn piñata:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the piñata} = \$13
   \]

2. Cost of the Reese's:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Reese's} = 4 \text{ bags} \times \$9 \text{ per bag} = \$36
   \]

3. Cost of the Snickers:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Snickers} = 3 \text{ bags} \times \$5 \text{ per bag} = \$15
   \]

4. Cost of the Skittles:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Skittles} = 5 \text{ bags} \times \$7 \text{ per bag} = \$35
   \]

Next, we sum the costs of the unicorn piñata and the treats:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the piñata} + \text{Cost of Reese's} + \text{Cost of Snickers} + \text{Cost of Skittles}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$13 + \$36 + \$15 + \$35

To find the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats, we first calculate the cost of each type of treat.

1. The cost of the unicorn piñata is simply the price for which it was bought, which is $13.
2. For the Reese’s, since 4 bags cost $9 each, the total cost for Reese's is \( 4 \times \$9 \).
3. For the Snickers, since 3 bags cost $5 each, the total cost for Snickers is \( 3 \times \$5 \).
4. For the Skittles, since 5 bags cost $7 each, the total cost for Skittles is \( 5 \times \$7 \).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of treat:

- Reese's cost: \( 4 \times \$9 = \$36 \)
- Snickers cost: \( 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \)
- Skittles cost: \( 5 \times \$7 = \$35 \)

Finally, to find the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats, we add up the costs:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 13 + \$36 + \$15 + \$35
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 13 + 36 + 15 + 35 = 99
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats is $99.

To determine the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats, we need to calculate the cost of each item individually and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the unicorn piñata:**
   The unicorn piñata costs $13.

2. **Cost of the Reese's bags:**
   - There are 4 bags of Reese's, each priced at $9.
   - Total cost for Reese's = \( 4 \times 9 = 36 \).

3. **Cost of the Snickers bags:**
   - There are 3 bags of Snickers, each priced at $5.
   - Total cost for Snickers = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

4. **Cost of the Skittles bags:**
   - There are 5 bags of Skittles, each priced at $7.
   - Total cost for Skittles = \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \).

Now, we sum up all the costs:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the piñata} + \text{Cost of Reese's} + \text{Cost of Snickers} + \text{Cost of Skittles}

\[
\text{Total cost} = 13 + 36 + 15 + 35
