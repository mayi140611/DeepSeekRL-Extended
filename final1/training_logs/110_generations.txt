#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Marvin sold 35 candy bars at $2 each, so he made $35 \times $2 = $70.

Tina sold three times the number of candy bars that Marvin did, so she sold 35 \times 3 = 105 candy bars.

Tina sold 105 candy bars at $2 each, so she made $105 \times $2 = $210.

Therefore, Tina made $210 - $70 = $140 more than Marvin.

Marvin sold 35 candy bars at $2 each, so he made 35 * $2 = $<<35*2=70>>70.
Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin, so she sold 35 * 3 = 105 candy bars.
Tina made 105 * $2 = $<<105*2=210>>210.
Therefore, Tina made $210 - $70 = $<<210-70=140>>140 more money than Marvin.

Let's calculate the number of candy bars sold by Tina first. Since Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin, and Marvin sold 35 candy bars, we have:
\[ \text{Tina's candy bars} = 3 \times \text{Marvin's candy bars} = 3 \times 35 = 105 \]

Next, we calculate the money made by Marvin and Tina by selling their candy bars. Each candy bar costs $2, so Marvin made:
\[ \text{Marvin's money} = 35 \times 2 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

And Tina made:
\[ \text{Tina's money} = 105 \times 2 = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money Tina made compared to Marvin, we subtract Marvin's money from Tina's money:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Tina's money} - \text{Marvin's money} = 210 - 70 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Tina made $140 more for the class trip selling candy bars compared to Marvin.

To find out how much more money Tina made compared to Marvin, we first need to calculate the total amount of money each of them made.

1. **Marvin's sales:**
   - Marvin sold 35 candy bars.
   - Each candy bar costs $2.
   - Total money Marvin made = number of candy bars sold × price per candy bar
   
   \[
   35 \text{ candy bars} \times \$2 \text{ per candy bar} = 70 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Tina's sales:**
   - Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin.
   - Number of candy bars sold by Tina = 3 × 35 = 105 candy bars.
   - Each candy bar costs $2.
   - Total money Tina made = number of candy bars sold × price per candy bar
   
   \[
   105 \text{ candy bars} \times \$2 \text{ per candy bar} = 210 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Difference in money made:**
   - Difference = Tina's total money − Marvin's total money
   
   \[
   210 \text{ dollars} − 70 \text{ dollars} = 140 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Tina made $140 more than Marvin for their class trip.

To determine how much more money Tina made compared to Marvin, we need to calculate their individual earnings from selling candy bars and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of candy bars Tina sold:
\[ \text{Tina's candy bars} = 3 \times \text{Marvin's candy bars} = 3 \times 35 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate Marvin's earnings:
\[ \text{Marvin's earnings} = \text{Number of candy bars sold} \times \text{Price per candy bar} = 35 \times 2 = 70 \]

Now, let's calculate Tina's earnings:
\[ \text{Tina's earnings} = \text{Number of candy bars sold} \times \text{Price per candy bar} = 105 \times 2 = 210 \]

Finally, let's find the difference between Tina's and Marvin's earnings:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Tina's earnings} - \text{Marvin's earnings} = 210 - 70 = 140 \]

Therefore, Tina made $140 more than Marvin for the class trip selling candy bars.

To determine how much more money Tina made compared to Marvin, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them earned from selling candy bars.

First, let's find out how many candy bars Tina sold:
Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin.
Marvin sold 35 candy bars.
So, Tina sold \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \) candy bars.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money each of them made:
Each candy bar costs $2.

Marvin's earnings:
\[
35 \text{ candy bars} \times \$2 \text{ per candy bar} = \$70
\]

Tina's earnings:
\[
105 \text{ candy bars} \times \$2 \text{ per candy bar} = \$210
\]

Now, we find the difference in earnings between Tina and Marvin:
\[
210 - 70 = \$140
\]

So, Tina made \$140 more than Marvin.

</reasoning>
<answer>
...\

Marvin sold 35 candy bars at $2 each, so he earned \(35 \times 2 = 70\) dollars. Tina sold 3 times as many candy bars, so she sold \(35 \times 3 = 105\) candy bars at $2 each. Therefore, she earned \(105 \times 2 = 210\) dollars. The difference between Tina's and Marvin's earnings is \(210 - 70 = 140\) dollars. Hence, Tina made \$140 more than Marvin.
