#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out how many calories are remaining in the block, we need to first determine the total number of calories in the block and then subtract the calories Rick has already consumed.

1. Calculate the total calories in the block:
\[ \text{Total calories} = \text{Calories per serving} \times \text{Number of servings per block} \]
\[ \text{Total calories} = 110 \, \text{calories/serving} \times 16 \, \text{servings/block} \]
\[ \text{Total calories} = 1760 \, \text{calories} \]

2. Calculate the calories consumed by Rick:
\[ \text{Calories consumed} = \text{Calories per serving} \times \text{Number of servings consumed} \]
\[ \text{Calories consumed} = 110 \, \text{calories/serving} \times 5 \, \text{servings} \]
\[ \text{Calories consumed} = 550 \, \text{calories} \]

3. Calculate the remaining calories in the block:
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = \text{Total calories} - \text{Calories consumed} \]
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 1760 \, \text{calories} - 550 \, \text{calories} \]
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 1210 \, \text{calories} \]

system
First, we determine the total number of calories in the block of cheese by multiplying the number of servings per block by the number of calories per serving. This gives us 16 * 110 = 1760 calories.
Now, we find how many calories are remaining by subtracting the number of calories Rick has already eaten from the total number of calories. This gives us 1760 - (5 * 110) = 210 calories remaining.

Rick has eaten 5 servings of cheese, which means there are 16 - 5 = 11 servings remaining in the block.

Since there are 110 calories in a serving of cheese, the total calories remaining in the block are 11 * 110 = 1210 calories.

First, we determine the total amount of calories in the block of cheese. Since there are 16 servings per block and each serving has 110 calories, the total number of calories in one block is 16 * 110 = 1760 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories Rick has already consumed. Since Rick has eaten 5 servings and each serving has 110 calories, the total number of calories consumed is 5 * 110 = 550 calories.

Finally, to find out the remaining calories in the block, we subtract the consumed calories from the total calories in the block: 1760 - 550 = 1210 calories remaining.

The total number of servings in the block is 16, and Rick has eaten 5 servings, leaving 16 - 5 = 11 servings remaining.

Each serving has 110 calories, so the total number of calories remaining is 11 * 110 = 1210 calories.

To find the remaining calories in the block, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of servings in the entire block.
2. Calculate the total calories in the entire block.
3. Subtract the calories consumed from the total calories in the block to find the remaining calories.

Step 1: The block has 16 servings.

Step 2: Calculate the total calories in the entire block.
\[
\text{Total calories per block} = \text{Number of servings per block} \times \text{Calories per serving}
\]
\[
\text{Total calories per block} = 16 \times 110 = 1760 \text{ calories}
\]

Step 3: Rick has eaten 5 servings.
\[
\text{Calories consumed} = \text{Calories per serving} \times \text{Number of servings eaten}
\]
\[
\text{Calories consumed} = 110 \times 5 = 550 \text{ calories}
\]

Step 4: Calculate the remaining calories.
\[
\text{Remaining calories} = \text{Total calories per block} - \text{Calories consumed}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining calories} = 1760 - 550 = 1210 \text{ calories}
\]

Therefore, the remaining calories in the block are 1210.

If Rick has already eaten 5 servings of cheese, he has used 5 servings * 110 calories/serving = 550 calories.
There are 110 calories in a serving of cheese and 16 servings per block, there are 110 calories/serving * 16 servings/block = 1760 calories in a block of cheese.
If Rick has eaten 5 servings, there are 1760 calories - 550 calories = 1210 calories remaining in the block.

Each serving has 110 calories. If he has eaten 5 servings, that leaves us with 16-5 = 11 servings.
Each large block contains 16 servings. Meaning there are 16 / 110 = 1.454 calories remaining in the block.
