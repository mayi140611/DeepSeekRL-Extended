###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Rick has 130 cards. He decided to only keep 15 cards and so he gave Miguel some of the cards. Then, he saw 8 friends and decided to give them 12 cards each, and the remaining cards were given equally to his 2 sisters. If each of Rick's sisters got 3 cards, how many cards did Rick give to Miguel?

1. First, determine how many cards Rick had initially: 130 cards.
2. Rick kept 15 cards for himself: \(130 - 15 = 115\) cards.
3. Rick saw 8 other friends and gave each 12 cards: \(8 \times 12 = 96\) cards.
4. Rick gave the remaining cards to his 2 sisters, and each sister received 3 cards: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) cards.
5. Calculate the number of cards given to Miguel: \(115 - 96 - 6 = 13\).

First, we need to calculate the total number of cards left after Rick keeps 15 cards. Rick started with 130 cards and saved 15 for himself. So, the number of cards left is:
\[ 130 - 15 = 115 \]

Next, we determine how many cards Rick gave to his friends. He saw 8 friends and gave each of them 12 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards given to his friends is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]

Then, we know that each of Rick's sisters received 3 cards, and there are 2 sisters. So, the total number of cards given to his sisters is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we subtract the number of cards given to his friends and sisters from the remaining cards to find out how many cards Rick gave to Miguel:
\[ 115 - 96 - 6 = 13 \]

Therefore, Rick gave 13 cards to Miguel.

Rick started with 130 cards. He decided to keep 15 cards and give the rest to others. So, first, we calculate the number of cards left after Rick keeps 15 cards:
\[ 130 - 15 = 115 \]
Next, he saw 8 friends and decided to give each of them 12 cards. We calculate how many cards he gave away to his friends:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]
This means he gave a total of 96 cards to his friends. After giving cards to his friends, the number of cards left is:
\[ 115 - 96 = 19 \]
Then, he gave the remaining cards equally to his 2 sisters. Each sister received 3 cards, so the total number of cards given to his sisters is:

Rick starts with 130 cards. He decides to keep 15 cards for himself and give the rest to Miguel. Let's calculate how many cards are left to give to Miguel:
\[ 130 - 15 = 115 \]
Rick then gives cards to 8 friends and each friend gets 12 cards:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]
This means that after giving cards to his friends and keeping the 15, the number of cards Rick gives to Miguel is:
\[ 115 - 96 = 19 \]
Rick also gives cards to his 2 sisters, with each sister getting 3 cards:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
Therefore, the total number of cards that Rick gives to Miguel and his sisters is:
\[ 19 + 6 = 25 \]

Rounding the answer:
\[ 25 \]

The calculation shows that Rick gave 25 cards to Miguel.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

2. Rick decides to keep 15 cards for himself. Therefore, the number of cards left after he keeps 15 is:
   \[
   130 - 15 = 115 \text{ cards}

3. Rick then gives these 115 cards to 8 friends, each receiving 12 cards. The total number of cards given to his friends is:
   \[
   8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ cards}
   \]
4. After giving 96 cards to his friends, the number of cards left is:
   \[
   115 - 96 = 19 \text{ cards}
   \]
5. These remaining 19 cards are given equally to his 2 sisters. Each sister gets 3 cards, so:
   \[
   19 = 2 \times 3 + \text{remaining cards}

   Thus, the remaining cards after giving to his sisters are:
   \[

First, we'll calculate the total number of cards given to Rick's friends. Since he has 8 friends and gave each 12 cards, the total number of cards given to his friends is 8 * 12 = 96 cards.

Next, we'll determine the number of cards left for Rick's sisters. Given that each sister received 3 cards and there are 2 sisters, this means 2 * 3 = 6 cards were given to his sisters.

Now, we'll find out how many cards were given to Miguel. Since the total number of cards initially is 130, after giving cards to friends and sisters, the remaining cards are 130 - 96 - 6 = 28 cards. These 28 cards were given to Miguel.

To determine how many cards Rick gave to Miguel, we first need to calculate the total number of cards given away or distributed to others.

1. Rick decided to keep 15 cards for himself. So, the number of cards left after he keeps some is:
   \[ 130 - 15 = 115 \]

2. Rick then gave 8 friends 12 cards each. The total number of cards given to friends is:
   \[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]

3. Rick also gave some cards to his sisters. We know that each sister got 3 cards:
   \[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, we sum up all the cards distributed:
\[ 96 \text{ (to friends)} + 6 \text{ (to sisters)} = 102 \]

Subtracting this total from the remaining cards gives us the number of cards given to Miguel:
\[ 115 - 102 = 13 \]

Therefore, Rick gave Miguel 13 cards.

1. Let's start by calculating how many cards Rick kept after receiving some from Miguel.
   Rick originally had 130 cards and decided to keep 15.
   Therefore, he gave away \( 130 - 15 = 115 \) cards.

2. Next, Rick saw 8 friends and decided to give each of them 12 cards.
   So, he gave away \( 12 \times 8 = 96 \) cards to his friends.

3. Rick also gave the remaining cards to his 2 sisters.
   He gave each sister 3 cards, so to the sisters, he gave \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) cards.

4. Now, subtract the total cards given to friends and sisters from the total cards he gave away:
   Total cards given away - cards given to friends - cards given to sisters = cards given to Miguel.
   Hence, cards given to Miguel = \( 115 - 96 - 6 = 13 \).

Therefore, Rick gave 13 cards to Miguel.

1. Initially, Rick has 130 cards.
2. He decides to keep 15 cards for himself.
3. Therefore, the number of cards given to Miguel is:
   \[
   130 - 15 = 115 \text{ cards}
   \]
4. Then, Rick distributes the remaining 115 cards equally to 8 friends, with each friend receiving 12 cards:
   \[
   8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ cards}
   \]
5. The remaining cards after giving 12 cards to each friend are:
   \[
   115 - 96 = 19 \text{ cards}
   \]

6. These remaining 19 cards are equally divided among his 2 sisters. Each sister gets 3 cards:
   \[
   19 \div 2 = 9.5 \text{ cards per sister (though not possible since the number of cards must be an integer)}
   \]
   Thus, each sister gets 3 cards.

7. The number of cards given to Miguel can be determined by considering the equation established:
   \[
   \text{Total cards not given to Miguel} = (\text{cards given to friends}) + (\text{cards given to sisters}) - (\text{cards kept by Rick})
   \]
   Given that siblings each got 3 cards out of these cards, Rick must have given Miguel at least some cards:
   \[
   115 = 96 + 2 \times (\text{3 cards per sister}) + (\text{cards kept by Rick})
   \]
   The siblings cards are given out:
   \[
   96 + 6 = 102
   \]
   Since these were his sisters, he must have given \(115-102 = 13\) cards to Miguel and kept 15.

8. Thus the total to Miguel must add up, which implies:
   \[
   \text{cards Miguel has} + \text{cards kept by Rick} = 19
   \]
   Solving:
   \[
   19 = 15 + 4
   \]
   implies:
   \[
   \text{cards Miguel has} = 4
   \]
   So Miguel must have 4 cards.

9. Substituting back to find Miguel's cards:
   Therefore:
   \[
   Miguel = 115 - 96 - 6 = 4

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rick starts with 130 cards.
2. He decides to keep 15 cards for himself.
   \[
   \text{Cards left after keeping 15} = 130 - 15 = 115
   \]
3. Rick then gives 8 friends cards, giving each 12 cards in total.
   \[
   \text{Total cards given to friends} = 8 \times 12 = 96
   \]
4. After giving cards to friends, the remaining cards are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining cards} = 115 - 96 = 19
   \]
5. These remaining 19 cards are given equally to Rick's 2 sisters.
   \[
   \text{Cards given to each sister} = \frac{19}{2} = 9.5
   \]
   Since the problem states each sister got 3 cards, it's likely there's a need to re-evaluate part of the given information or the initial problem setup. However, the problem as stated implies each sister got 3 cards.

6. Given each sister got 3 cards, the total cards given to the sisters should be:
   \[
   \text{Each sister's cards received} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]
7. However, the problem states that 19 cards were given equally to the sisters, which contradicts the assumption of 3 cards each. Thus, there's a discrepancy in the problem's premise.

8. Since each sister ended up with 3 cards, and not 19, the 19 cards must have been given to Miguel.

9. Therefore, if we subtract the cards given to the sisters from 19, the number of cards given to Miguel is:
   \[
   \text{Cards given to Miguel} = 19 - 6 = 13
   \]

So, the total number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is 13.
