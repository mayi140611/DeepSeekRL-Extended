To find out how much charcoal Jason needs to add, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of charcoal to water.

The ratio given is 2 grams of charcoal : 30 ml of water.

If Jason adds 900 ml of water, we can set up the proportion as follows:

\( \frac{2 \text{ grams of charcoal}}{30 \text{ ml of water}} = \frac{x \text{ grams of charcoal}}{900 \text{ ml of water}} \)

Solving for x:

\( x = \frac{2 \times 900}{30} \)

\( x = \frac{1800}{30} \)

\( x = 60 \text{ grams of charcoal} \)

So, Jason needs to add 60 grams of charcoal when he adds 900 ml of water.

To determine how much charcoal Jason needs, we start by understanding the ratio he is using: 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water.

First, we calculate how many 30 ml portions fit into the 900 ml of water:
\[
\frac{900 \text{ ml}}{30 \text{ ml/portion}} = 30 \text{ portions}
\]

Since the ratio is 2 grams of charcoal for each 30 ml of water, we multiply the number of portions by the grams of charcoal per portion:
\[
30 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ grams/portion} = 60 \text{ grams}
\]

Thus, Jason needs to add 60 grams of charcoal.

To determine how much charcoal Jason adds, we start by understanding the ratio given: 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water. We need to find out how much charcoal corresponds to 900 ml of water.

First, we set up a proportion to find out how many grams of charcoal are needed for 900 ml of water. The ratio of charcoal to water is 2 grams of charcoal per 30 ml of water. Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ grams of charcoal}}{30 \text{ ml of water}} = \frac{x \text{ grams of charcoal}}{900 \text{ ml of water}}
\]

Here, \( x \) is the amount of charcoal needed for 900 ml of water. To find \( x \), we solve the proportion by cross-multiplying:

\[
2 \text{ grams of charcoal} \times 900 \text{ ml of water} = 30 \text{ ml of water} \times x \text{ grams of charcoal}
\]

\[
1800 = 30x
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 30:

\[
x = \frac{1800}{30} = 60
\]

So, Jason needs to add 60 grams of charcoal for 900 ml of water.

The ratio of charcoal to water is 2 grams per 30 ml. If Jason adds 900 ml of water, we can calculate the amount of charcoal he needs based on this ratio.

First, find out how many 30 ml portions are in 900 ml:
\[ \frac{900 \, \text{ml}}{30 \, \text{ml}} = 30 \]

The amount of charcoal needed for 30 portions would be:
\[ 30 \times 2 \, \text{grams} = 60 \, \text{grams} \]

Therefore, Jason needs to add 60 grams of charcoal.

We know that for every 30 ml of water, 2 grams of charcoal are needed. 

First, determine how much charcoal is needed per milliliter of water:
\[ \text{Charcoal per ml} = \frac{2 \text{ grams}}{30 \text{ ml}} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Charcoal per ml} = \frac{1}{15} \text{ grams/ml} \]

Since 900 ml of water is being added, we multiply the amount of charcoal per ml by 900 ml:
\[ \text{Charcoal needed} = 900 \times \frac{1}{15} \]
\[ \text{Charcoal needed} = 60 \text{ grams} \]

To determine how much charcoal Jason adds, we first need to understand the ratio and then apply it to the amount of water he adds.

The ratio given is: 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water.

First, we find out how many 30 ml portions are in 900 ml:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ ml}}{30 \text{ ml}} = 30 \]

This means that there are 30 portions of 30 ml in 900 ml. For each portion of water, Jason adds 2 grams of charcoal. Therefore, for 30 portions (which is equivalent to 900 ml), Jason will add:
\[ 30 \times 2 \text{ grams} = 60 \text{ grams} \]

So, Jason adds 60 grams of charcoal.

To determine how much charcoal Jason should add, we first need to understand the ratio given: 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water. 

We can express this ratio as a fraction: 
\[ \frac{2 \text{ grams charcoal}}{30 \text{ ml water}} \]

Next, we need to determine how many sets of 30 ml are in 900 ml of water:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ ml water}}{30 \text{ ml water per set}} = 30 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set requires 2 grams of charcoal, we can calculate the total amount of charcoal needed by multiplying the number of sets by the amount of charcoal per set:
\[ 30 \text{ sets} \times 2 \text{ grams per set} = 60 \text{ grams of charcoal} \]

So the final calculation should be:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ ml}}{30 \text{ ml per set}} = 30 \text{ sets} \]
\[ 30 \text{ sets} \times 2 \text{ grams per set} = 60 \text{ grams of charcoal} \]

Therefore, Jason should add 60 grams of charcoal.

To determine how much charcoal Jason needs, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of charcoal to water.

The original ratio of charcoal to water is 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water. This can be written as the ratio 2:30 or simplified to 1:15.

Jason is adding 900 ml of water. We can set up the proportion as follows:

1 gram of charcoal / 15 ml of water = \(x\) grams of charcoal / 900 ml of water

Now we solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{1 \text{ gram of charcoal} \times 900 \text{ ml of water}}{15 \text{ ml of water}}\]

\[x = 60 \text{ grams of charcoal}\]

So, Jason needs 60 grams of charcoal.

To determine how much charcoal Jason needs to add, we start by finding the ratio of charcoal to water from the given information. The ratio is 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water.

First, we calculate the amount of charcoal needed for 900 ml of water. Since 30 ml of water requires 2 grams of charcoal, we can set up the following proportion to find out how much charcoal is needed for 900 ml:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ grams of charcoal}}{30 \text{ ml of water}} = \frac{x \text{ grams of charcoal}}{900 \text{ ml of water}}
\]

Here, \( x \) represents the amount of charcoal needed for 900 ml of water. To find \( x \), we solve the proportion by cross-multiplying:

\[
2 \text{ grams of charcoal} \times 900 \text{ ml of water} = 30 \text{ ml of water} \times x \text{ grams of charcoal}
\]

\[
1800 = 30x
