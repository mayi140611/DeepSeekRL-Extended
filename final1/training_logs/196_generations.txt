To find out how old Herbert will be next year, we can first find out how old Herbert is now. Since Herbert is 10 years younger than Kris, who is 24 years old, we can subtract 10 from Kris's age. 

So Herbert's current age is 24 - 10 = 14 years old.

Now, to find out how old Herbert will be next year, we add 1 to his current age.

So Herbert will be 14 + 1 = 15 years old next year.
