Let's denote the number of crayons Billie has as \( B \). According to the problem, Billie has 18 crayons, so \( B = 18 \).

Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie, so Bobbie has \( 3 \times B = 3 \times 18 = 54 \) crayons.

Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie, so Lizzie has \( \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \) crayons.

Therefore, Lizzie has 27 crayons.

To determine how many crayons Lizzie has, we can break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify the number of crayons Billie has**: Billie has 18 crayons.
2. **Determine how many crayons Bobbie has**: Since Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 18 = 54 \quad \text{crayons}
   \]
3. **Determine how many crayons Lizzie has**: Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie. We calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \quad \text{crayons}
   \]

Therefore, Lizzie has 27 crayons.

Let's start by determining the number of crayons each person has based on the information given.

First, we know:
- Billie has 18 crayons.
- Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie.

To find the number of crayons Bobbie has:
\[
\text{Crayons Bobbie has} = 3 \times \text{Crayons Billie has}
\]
\[
\text{Crayons Bobbie has} = 3 \times 18
\]
\[
\text{Crayons Bobbie has} = 54
\]

Next, we know:
- Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie.

To find the number of crayons Lizzie has:
\[
\text{Crayons Lizzie has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Crayons Bobbie has}
\]
\[
\text{Crayons Lizzie has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54
\]
\[
\text{Crayons Lizzie has} = 27
\]

Thus, Lizzie has 27 crayons.

To find out how many crayons Lizzie has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many crayons Bobbie has. Since Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie, and Bobbie has twice as many as Billie, we calculate Bobbie's crayons as follows:
   - Billie's crayons = 18
   - Bobbie's crayons = Bobbie's crayons * 3 = 18 * 3 = 54

2. Now that we know Bobbie has 54 crayons, we can find out how many crayons Lizzie has, since she has half as many crayons as Bobbie:
   - Lizzie's crayons = Bobbie's crayons / 2 = 54 / 2 = 27

Therefore, Lizzie has 27 crayons.

First, we calculate the number of crayons Bobbie has, which is three times the number of crayons Billie has:

Bobbie's crayons = 3 × Billie's crayons

Next, we calculate Lizzie's crayons, which is half the number of crayons Bobbie has:

Lizzie's crayons = 0.5 × Bobbie's crayons

Substituting the given number of crayons for Billie and solving gives us the number of crayons Lizzie has.

Bobbie has 3 × 18 = 54 crayons. Lizzie has 0.5 × 54 = 27 crayons.

We are given the following relationships between the number of crayons each person has:
1. Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie.
2. Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie.
3. Billie has 18 crayons.

From the above, we can determine the number of crayons for Bobbie first since it is given that Billie has 18 crayons.

Bobbie has \(3 \times 18\) crayons.
After finding the number of crayons Bobbie has, we can determine the number of crayons Lizzie has.

Lizzie has \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Bobbie's crayons}\).

Let's calculate these values.
</reasoning>
<answer>
</answer>
<reasoning>
Bobbie has \(3 \times 18 = 54\) crayons because Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie.

Lizzie has \(\frac{1}{2} \times 54 = \frac{54}{2} = 27\) crayons because Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie.

Next, we need to find out how many crayons Lizzie has. We know that Lizzie has half the number of crayons as Bobbie.

We can calculate the number of crayons Lizzie has:

\[
\text{Number of crayons Lizzie has} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Number of crayons Bobbie has})
\]

Let's perform these calculations using the given values.
