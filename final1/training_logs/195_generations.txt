The total cost of the drinks is 5 * $6 = $30. The total cost of the pizzas is 10 * $14 = $140. The total cost of all items is $30 + $140 = $170. The change she got back is $200 - $170 = $30.

The total spent for the drinks is 5 * $6 = $30. So the amount spent on the pizzas is 10 * $14 = $140. Adding the cost of the drinks and pizzas, the total spent is $30 + $140 = $170. Hence, the amount Mary got back is $200 - $170 = $30.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the drinks and pizzas.

Cost of drinks = Number of drinks * Price per drink
Cost of drinks = 5 * $6 = $30

Cost of pizzas = Number of pizzas * Price per pizza
Cost of pizzas = 10 * $14 = $140

Total cost = Cost of drinks + Cost of pizzas
Total cost = $30 + $140 = $170

Mary paid $200, so we subtract the total cost from $200 to calculate the change.

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $200 - $170 = $30

First, let's calculate the total cost of the drinks: 

5 boxes × $6/box = $30

Then, we calculate the total cost of the pizzas: 

10 boxes × $14/box = $140

Now, we add these two amounts to get the total amount spent: 

$30 (drinks) + $140 (pizzas) = $170

Finally, we subtract this from the amount Mary paid to find out how much change she received: 

$200 (paid) - $170 (spent) = $30
