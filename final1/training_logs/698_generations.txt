<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how much Lily spent in the second shop. She spent $7 on a shirt and thrice as much as she spent on a shirt in the second shop. Therefore, the amount spent on the second shirt is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) dollars.

Next, we will subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount in Lily's account. The initial amount in her account is $55. So, we calculate the remaining amount by subtracting the cost of the shirt, which included both the shirt and the second shirt, from the initial amount.

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 55 - (7 + 21) = 55 - 28 = 27
\]

So, the amount left in Lily's account is $27.

Lily initially had $55 in her account. She spent $7 on a shirt, so we subtract $7 from her initial amount to find out how much money she has left: $55 - $7 = $48. Then, she went to another shop and spent thrice as much as she spent on a shirt. Thrice the amount spent on a shirt is $7 * 3 = $21. We subtract this amount from the remaining balance to find out how much money she has left after shopping in the second shop: $48 - $21 = $27. Therefore, Lily has $27 left in her account.

To determine how much money Lily has left in her account, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount**: Lily starts with $55.
2. **Spending on Shirt**: She spends $7 on a shirt. So, her remaining amount is:
   \[
   55 - 7 = 48
   \]
3. **Spending at Second Shop**: She spends thrice as much as she spent on the shirt. Since she spent $7, she spends:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   Thus, her remaining amount after this expenditure is:
   \[
   48 - 21 = 27
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Lily's account is $27.

Lily initially had $55 in her account. She spent $7 on a shirt. She then spent thrice as much on another shop, which means she spent \(3 \times 7 = 21\) dollars on another shop.

The total amount spent by Lily is \(7 + 21 = 28\) dollars. Subtracting this from her initial amount gives the amount left in her account: \(55 - 28 = 27\) dollars.

To determine how much money Lily has left in her account, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial amount in Lily's account, which is $55.
2. Subtract the amount spent on the shirt, which is $7.
3. Calculate the amount spent at the second shop, which is three times the amount spent on the shirt, so it is \(3 \times 7 = \$21\).
4. Subtract the amount spent at the second shop from the remaining amount after shopping for the shirt.

Let's perform the calculations step by step:
- Amount remaining after buying the shirt: \( \$55 - \$7 = \$48 \)
- Amount spent at the second shop: \( \$21 \)
- Amount left in the account: \( \$48 - \$21 = \$27 \)

So, the amount left in Lily's account is $27.

<reasoning>
Firstly, Lily had $55 in her account. After spending $7 on a shirt, she had:
\[ 55 - 7 = 48 \]
Then, she spent thrice the amount she spent on a shirt at the second shop, which is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, after spending at the second shop, she has:
\[ 48 - 21 = 27 \]
Thus, the amount of money left in Lily's account is $27.

<reasoning>
First, we calculate how much Lily spent at the second shop, which is thrice as much as the shirt she bought. So, if she spent $7 on the shirt, then at the second shop she spent $7 * 3 = $21. 

Next, we add up all her expenses: $7 (shirt) + $21 (second shop) = $28. 

Then, we subtract this total from her initial amount, which was $55, to find out how much is left: $55 - $28 = $27.

Now, to calculate the cost per pound of watermelons, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pounds of watermelons bought. The total amount spent is $80, and she bought 8 pounds of watermelons. So, the cost per pound is $80 / 8 = $10 per pound.

First, we calculate the amount Lily spent at the first shop. According to the information, she spent $7 on a shirt. At the second shop, she spent three times as much, which is $7 * 3 = $21.

The total amount spent is the sum of the amounts spent at both shops: $7 + $21 = $28.

Initially, Lily had $55 in her account. After spending $28, the remaining amount in her account is $55 - $28 = $27.

Lily originally had $55 in her account. She spent $7 on a shirt, so her account balance becomes $55 - $7. Then, she spent $7 * 3, which is $21, at another shop. To find out how much money is left in her account, we subtract the amount spent at the second shop from the amount left after the first purchase: ($55 - $7) - ($7 * 3).

$$55 - 7 - (7*3) = 45$$

First, we need to determine how much Lily spent at the second shop. The problem states that she spent three times as much as she spent on a shirt, which was $7. Therefore, the amount spent at the second shop is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

Next, we calculate the total amount spent by adding the cost of the shirt and the second shop to the initial amount in her account. Lily's initial amount was $55. She spent $7 on a shirt, which is:

\[ 55 + 7 = 62 \]

Then she spent an additional $21 at the second shop, so adding that to the previous total:

\[ 62 + 21 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total amount left in Lily's account is $83.
