To determine the total number of cars traveling down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday, let's break down the information given:

1. On Tuesday, 25 cars pass through.
2. On Monday, 20% less than on Tuesday:
    25 cars (Tuesday) - 20% of 25 cars = 25 - 5 = 20 cars (Monday)
3. On Wednesday, 2 more cars than on Monday:
    20 cars (Monday) + 2 cars = 22 cars (Wednesday)
4. On Thursday and Friday, 10 cars each day:
    4 cars per day (Thursday and Friday) * 2 days = 8 cars (Thursday and Friday)
5. On the weekend, traffic drops to 5 cars per day:
    2 days (Saturday and Sunday) * 5 cars = 10 cars (Saturday and Sunday)

To find the total, add all these numbers together:
20 + 22 + 8 + 10 = 60 cars from Monday to Sunday

The answer is 60 cars from Monday to Sunday.

To determine the total number of cars that travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday, we will calculate the number of cars passing through each day and sum them up. 

1. **Tuesday:**
   \[
   \text{Cars on Tuesday} = 25
   \]

2. **Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Cars on Monday} = 20\% \text{ less than Tuesday} = 25 - \left(0.20 \times 25\right) = 25 - 5 = 20
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   \[
   \text{Cars on Wednesday} = 2 \text{ more than Monday} = 20 + 2 = 22
   \]

4. **Thursday and Friday:**
   \[
   \text{Cars on each of Thursday and Friday} = 10 \text{ each day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cars on Thursday and Friday} = 10 + 10 = 20
   \]

5. **Saturday and Sunday:**
   \[
   \text{Cars on each of Saturday and Sunday} = 5 \text{ each day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cars on Saturday and Sunday} = 5 + 5 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of cars for all seven days:
\[
\text{Total cars from Monday to Sunday} = 25 + 20 + 22 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 107
\]

Therefore, the total number of cars that travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday is \(107\).

To calculate the total car traffic on Happy Street from Monday through Sunday, we need to first figure out the number of cars that pass through on each day.

On Monday, the number of cars is 20% less than on Tuesday. Since there are 25 cars on Tuesday, the number of cars on Monday is:
25 cars - (20% of 25) = 25 - (0.20 * 25) = 25 - 5 = 20 cars

On Wednesday, the number of cars is 2 more than on Monday. Since there are 20 cars on Monday, the number of cars on Wednesday is:
20 cars + 2 = 22 cars

On Thursday and Friday, the number of cars is about the same each day, so:
20 cars (Thursday) + 20 cars (Friday) = 40 cars

On the weekend, there are 5 cars per day, so:
5 cars (Saturday) + 5 cars (Sunday) = 10 cars

Now, we add up all the cars from Monday through Sunday:
25 (Tuesday) + 20 (Monday) + 22 (Wednesday) + 40 (Thursday + Friday) + 10 (Saturday + Sunday) = 117 cars

So, a total of 117 cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday.

To find out how many cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday, we can use the given information and perform some mathematical calculations.

On Tuesday, 25 cars pass by.
On Monday, 20% less than on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, 2 more cars than on Monday.

We start by calculating the number of cars on Monday:
Monday = 25 - (0.20 * 25) = 25 - 5 = 20 cars

Now we calculate the number of cars on Wednesday:
Wednesday = Monday + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 cars

Next, we determine the number of cars on Thursday and Friday:
Both Thursday and Friday have 10 cars each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cars for the week:
Total cars = Tuesday's cars + Monday's cars + Wednesday's cars + Thursday's cars + Friday's cars + Saturday's cars + Sunday's cars
Total cars = 25 + 20 + 22 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5

Calculating the total:
Total cars = 105

So, there are 105 cars that travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday.

To find out how many cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday, we need to calculate the number of cars passing on each day and then sum them up.

Let's start with Tuesday:
- Tuesday: 25 cars

Next, we calculate the number of cars that pass on Monday:
- Monday: 20% less than on Tuesday, so 80% of Tuesday's cars
- Monday's cars = 0.80 * 25 = 20 cars

Then, we calculate the number of cars that pass on Wednesday:
- Wednesday: 2 more cars than on Monday, so Monday's cars + 2
- Wednesday's cars = 20 + 2 = 22 cars

Now, let's compute the total for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday (since we don't have specific numbers for these days, we'll just add the known cars):
- Monday's cars: 20 cars
- Wednesday's cars: 22 cars
- Thursday: 10 cars
- Friday: 10 cars

Summing up these:
- Total for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined: 20 + 22 + 10 + 10 = 62 cars

Now, we need to calculate the weekend traffic:
- Saturday: 5 cars
- Sunday: 5 cars

Adding these to the previous total:
- Friday to Sunday total: 62 + 5 + 5 = 72 cars

Finally, we sum up the traffic for the week:
- Total from Monday through Sunday: 25 (Tuesday) + 62 (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday) = 87 cars

Therefore, 87 cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday.

To find the total number of cars that pass Happy Street from Monday through Sunday, we need to calculate the daily traffic for each day of the week and then sum these values. Let's start with the given information and break it down step by step.

1. On **Tuesday**, the number of cars is given as 25.

2. On **Monday**, the number of cars is 20% less than on **Tuesday**. To calculate this, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of cars on Monday} = \text{Number of cars on Tuesday} \times (1 - 0.20) = 25 \times 0.80 = 20
   \]

3. On **Wednesday**, the number of cars is 2 more than on **Monday**. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of cars on Wednesday} = \text{Number of cars on Monday} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22
   \]

4. On **Thursday and Friday**, the number of cars is constant at 10 each day:
   \[
   \text{Number of cars on Thursday} = \text{Number of cars on Friday} = 10
   \]

5. On **Saturday and Sunday, the number of cars is 5 each day**:
   \[
   \text{Number of cars on Saturday} = \text{Number of cars on Sunday} = 5
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of cars for all seven days:

\[
\text{Total cars} = 25 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 22 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 10 \text{ (Thursday)} + 10 \text{ (Friday)} + 5 \text{ (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ (Sunday)}
\]

Adding these values together:

\[
\text{Total cars} = 25 + 20 + 22 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 97
\]

Therefore, the total number of cars that travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday is **97 cars**.

Let's calculate the traffic for each day of the week starting from Tuesday and working backwards.

On Tuesday, there are 25 cars.

On Monday, there are 20% less than on Tuesday, so:
Monday's traffic = Tuesday's traffic - 20% of Tuesday's traffic
= 25 - 0.20 * 25
= 25 - 5
= 20 cars

On Wednesday, there are 2 more cars than on Monday:
Wednesday's traffic = Monday's traffic + 2
= 20 + 2
= 22 cars

On Thursday and Friday, there are about 10 cars each day:
Thursday's traffic = 10 cars
Friday's traffic = 10 cars

Next, we calculate the traffic on Saturday and Sunday:
Saturday's traffic = 5 cars
Sunday's traffic = 5 cars (since the traffic on the weekend drops to this level each day)

Now, let's add up the traffic from Monday through Sunday:
Total traffic from Monday through Sunday = Monday's traffic + Tuesday's traffic + Wednesday's traffic + Thursday's traffic + Friday's traffic + Saturday's traffic + Sunday's traffic
= 20 + 25 + 22 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5
= 107 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars that travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday is 107 cars.

To find the total number of cars traveling down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday, we need to calculate the number of cars for each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of cars on Monday:
- On Monday, the number of cars is 20% less than on Tuesday.
- Number of cars on Tuesday = 25
- Number of cars on Monday = 25 - 0.20 * 25 = 25 - 5 = 20

Next, let's calculate the number of cars on Wednesday:
- On Wednesday, the number of cars is 2 more than on Monday.
- Number of cars on Wednesday = 20 + 2 = 22

Now we know the number of cars for each day of the week:
- Monday: 20 cars

- Wednesday: 22 cars
- Thursday: 10 cars
- Friday: 10 cars
- Saturday: 5 cars
- Sunday: 5 cars

Finally, let's sum up the total number of cars:
- Total number of cars = 20 (Monday) + 25 (Tuesday) + 22 (Wednesday) + 10 (Thursday) + 10 (Friday) + 5 (Saturday) + 5 (Sunday)
- Total number of cars = 20 + 25 + 22 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 107
