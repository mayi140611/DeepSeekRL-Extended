To determine how many points the first-place team beat Joe's team by, we first need to calculate the total points for both the Joe's team and the first-place team.

For Joe's team, they won 1 game and tied 3 matches. The scoring structure is as follows:
- Wins: 3 points each
- Draws: 1 point each

The points for Joe's team can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Points for Joe's team} = (\text{Winnings points}) + 3 \times (\text{Tied points}) \]
\[ = 3 \times 1 + 3 \times 1 \]
\[ = 3 + 3 \]
\[ = 6 \]

For the first-place team, they won 2 games and tied 2 matches. Using the same scoring structure:
\[ \text{Points for the first-place team} = (2 \times 3) + 2 \times 1 \]
\[ = 6 + 2 \]
\[ = 8 \]

Now, we find the difference in points between the first-place team and Joe's team:
\[ \text{Difference} = 8 - 6 \]
\[ = 2 \]

Therefore, the first-place team beat Joe's team by 2 points.

To determine by how many points the first-place team beat Joe's team, we need to calculate the total points for each team based on the given information.

1. Calculate Joe's team's points:
   - Joe's team won 1 game, which scores 3 points.
   - Joe's team drew 3 matches, which scores 1 point per match (3 matches * 1 point/match = 3 points).
   - Total points for Joe's team: 3 (from win) + 3 (from draw) = 6 points.

2. Calculate the first-place team's points:
   - First-place team won 2 games, which score 3 points per game (2 games * 3 points/game = 6 points).
   - First-place team tied 2 matches, which score 1 point per match (2 matches * 1 point/match = 2 points).
   - Total points for the first-place team: 6 (from wins) + 2 (from draws) = 8 points.

3. Determine the difference in points between the first-place team and Joe's team:
   - Difference in points: 8 (first-place team) - 6 (Joe's team) = 2 points.

Therefore, the first-place team beat Joe's team by 2 points.

To determine the number of points each team has, we can break the situation down as follows:

1. Joe's team's points:
   - They won 1 game, which is worth 3 points.
   - They drew 3 games, which is worth 3 * 1 = 3 points from ties.
   - Total points for Joe's team = 3 + 3 = 6 points.

2. The first-place team's points:
   - They won 2 games, which is worth 3 * 2 = 6 points.
   - They drew 2 games, which is worth 2 * 1 = 2 points from ties.
   - Total points for the first-place team = 6 + 2 = 8 points.

Next, we calculate the difference in points between the first-place team and Joe's team:
- Difference in points = 8 - 6 = 2 points.

So, the first-place team beat Joe's team by 2 points.

To determine how many points the first-place team beat Joe's team, we need to calculate the total score for each team based on the given rules.

1. **Joe's Team:**
   - Won 1 game: 1 x 3 points = 3 points.
   - Drew 3 games: 3 x 1 point = 3 points.
   - Total score for Joe's team = 3 + 3 = 6 points.

2. **First-Place Team:**
   - Won 2 games: 2 x 3 points = 6 points.
   - Drew 2 games: 2 x 1 point = 2 points.
   - Total score for the first-place team = 6 + 2 = 8 points.

3. **Difference in Points:**
   - Difference in points = 8 (first-place team's score) - 6 (Joe's team's score) = 2 points.

Therefore, the first-place team beat Joe's team by 2 points.

To determine how many points the first-place team beat Joe's team by, we need to calculate the total points for each team based on the information provided.

First, we calculate Joe's team's total points:
- Joe's team won 1 game, scoring 3 points per win.
- Joe's team drew 3 games, scoring 1 point per tie.
So, Joe's team's total points = (1 win * 3 points/won) + (3 ties * 1 point/tie) = 3 points + 3 points = 6 points.

Next, we calculate the first-place team's total points:
- The first-place team won 2 games, scoring 3 points per win.
- The first-place team drew 2 games, scoring 1 point per tie.
So, the first-place team's total points = (2 wins * 3 points/won) + (2 ties * 1 point/tie) = 6 points + 2 points = 8 points.

The first-place team beat Joe's team by:
Total points of the first-place team - Total points of Joe's team = 8 points - 6 points = 2 points.

Therefore, the first-place team beat Joe's team by 2 points.

- Joe's team drew 3 games, scoring \(3 \times 1 = 3\) points.
So, the total points for Joe's team is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

- The first-place team drew 2 games, scoring \(2 \times 1 = 2\) points.
So, the total points for the first-place team is \(6 + 2 = 8\).

Finally, to find out how many points the first-place team beat Joe's team, we subtract Joe's team's points from the first-place team's points:
\(8 - 6 = 2\).

To determine how many points the first-place team beat Joe's team by, we need to calculate the total points for each team based on the games they won and drew.

First, let's calculate the points for Joe's team:
- Joe's team won 1 game and tied 3 games, so they get:
    - 1 game × 3 points = 3 points from wins
    - 3 games × 1 point = 3 points from ties
    - Total points = 3 + 3 = 6 points

Next, let's calculate the points for the first-place team:
- The first-place team won 2 games and tied 2 games, so they get:
    - 2 games × 3 points = 6 points from wins
    - 2 games × 1 point = 2 points from ties
    - Total points = 6 + 2 = 8 points

Now, we subtract the points of Joe's team from the points of the first-place team:
