Let's calculate the remaining fence step-by-step:

1. Ben whitewashed 10 feet of the fence. So, after Ben, the remaining fence is:
\[ 100 \text{ feet} - 10 \text{ feet} = 90 \text{ feet} \]

2. Billy then whitewashed a fifth of the remaining fence. So, Billy whitewashed:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 90 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet} \]

3. After Billy, the remaining fence is:
\[ 90 \text{ feet} - 18 \text{ feet} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

4. Johnny then whitewashed a third of the remaining fence. So, Johnny whitewashed:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

5. Finally, the remaining fence is:
\[ 72 \text{ feet} - 24 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the remaining part of the fence still needs to be whitewashed.

To determine how much of the fence still needs to be whitewashed, we need to calculate the total length of the fence that has already been whitewashed and subtract this from the total length of the fence.

1. Ben whitewashed 10 feet, so 100 - 10 = 90 feet remain.
2. Billy whitewashed a fifth of the remaining 90 feet, which is 90 / 5 = 18 feet. So 90 - 18 = 72 feet remain.
3. Johnny whitewashed a third of the remaining 72 feet, which is 72 / 3 = 24 feet. So 72 - 24 = 48 feet remain.

Therefore, 48 feet of the fence still needs to be whitewashed.

1. Tom's initial friend, Ben, whitewashed 10 feet of the fence.
2. Therefore, the remaining length of the fence after Ben's work is: 100 feet – 10 feet = 90 feet.
3. The second friend, Billy, whitewashed a fifth of the remaining 90 feet. So, Billy whitewashed 90 feet / 5 = 18 feet.
4. After Billy's work, the remaining length of the fence is: 90 feet – 18 feet = 72 feet.
5. The third friend, Johnny, whitewashed a third of the remaining 72 feet. So, Johnny whitewashed 72 feet / 3 = 24 feet.

5. Thus, the total length of the fence that still needs to be whitewashed is: Initially, 100 feet minus what's been whitewashed by Ben, Billy, and Johnny.

To find out the total length still needing to be whitewashed, we subtract the lengths whitewashed by each friend from the original 100 feet:
\[ 
100 \text{ feet} - 10 \text{ feet (Ben)} - 18 \text{ feet (Billy)} - 24 \text{ feet (Johnny)} \\
100 - 10 - 18 - 24 = 58 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of the fence that still needs to be whitewashed is 58 feet.

Tom's first friend, Ben, whitewashed 10 feet of the fence. After Ben, there is a remaining part of the fence that is 90 feet (100 feet - 10 feet). His second friend, Billy, whitewashed a fifth of the remaining fence, which is 90 feet / 5 = 18 feet. After Billy, there is a remaining part of the fence that is 72 feet (90 feet - 18 feet). His third friend, Johnny, whitewashed a third of the fence that was left, which is 72 feet / 3 = 24 feet. After Johnny, there is a remaining part of the fence that is 48 feet (72 feet - 24 feet).

First, we calculate how much of the fence remains after Ben whitewashed his 10 feet:

\[100 \, \text{feet} - 10 \, \text{feet} = 90 \, \text{feet}\]

Next, we determine how much of the remaining fence Billy whitewashed. He whitewashed a fifth of the original 100 feet:

\[
\frac{100}{5} = 20 \, \text{feet}
\]

This means that after Billy finished his part, there were:

\[90 \, \text{feet} - 20 \, \text{feet} = 70 \, \text{feet}\]

Then, Johnny whitewashed a third of the remaining 70 feet:

\[
\frac{70}{3} \approx 23.33 \, \text{feet}
\]

So, after Johnny finished his part, there were:

\[70 \, \text{feet} - 23.33 \, \text{feet} \approx 46.67 \, \text{feet}\]

Thus, if we consider the remaining fence, there were about 46.67 feet left that still needed to be whitewashed.

First, we determine the length of the fence left after Ben whitewashed his portion. After Ben whitewashed 10 feet, the remaining length of the fence is:
100 feet - 10 feet = 90 feet.

Next, Billy whitewashed a fifth of the remaining fence:
Billy's work = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 90 = 18 \) feet.

After Billy's work, the remaining length of the fence is:
90 feet - 18 feet = 72 feet.

Then, Johnny whitewashed a third of the fence that was left after Billy’s work:
Johnny's work = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 72 = 24 \) feet.

After Johnny's work, the remaining length of the fence is:
72 feet - 24 feet = 48 feet.

Therefore, the length of the fence that still needs to be whitewashed is 48 feet.

First, we know that Ben whitewashed 10 feet of the fence. This leaves:
\[ 100 \text{ feet} - 10 \text{ feet} = 90 \text{ feet} \]

After Ben's work, Billy whitewashed a fifth of the remaining fence. So Billy whitewashed:
\[ \frac{90}{5} = 18 \text{ feet} \]
This leaves:
\[ 90 \text{ feet} - 18 \text{ feet} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

After Billy's work, Johnny whitewashed a third of the remaining fence. So Johnny whitewashed:
\[ \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ feet} \]
This leaves:
\[ 72 \text{ feet} - 24 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

So, after all three friends have whitewashed part of the fence, 48 feet still need to be whitewashed.

First, we calculate the length of the fence whitewashed by Ben: \(10 \text{ feet}\). The remaining part after Ben whitewashed his part is:
\[100 \text{ feet} - 10 \text{ feet} = 90 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we find out how much of the remaining fence Johnny whitewashed: a fifth of the remaining 90 feet, which is:
\[\frac{1}{5} \times 90 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}\]

The part remaining after Johnny’s whitewashing is:
\[90 \text{ feet} - 18 \text{ feet} = 72 \text{ feet}\]

Finally, Ben's second friend, Billy, whitewashed \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the remaining 72 feet, which is:
\[\frac{1}{5} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 14.4 \text{ feet}\]

The part remaining after Billy whitewashed his part is:

To determine how much of the fence still needs to be whitewashed, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial fencing length**: 100 feet.
2. **Ben's contribution**: Ben whitewashed 10 feet. The remaining fence is now 100 - 10 = 90 feet.
3. **Billy's contribution**: Billy whitewashed a fifth of the remaining fence. Hence, Billy whitewashed \( \frac{1}{5} \times 90 = 18 \) feet. The new remaining fence is 90 - 18 = 72 feet.
4. **Johnny's contribution**: Johnny whitewashed a third of the remaining fence. So, Johnny whitewashed \( \frac{1}{3} \times 72 = 24 \) feet. After Johnny, the remaining fence is 72 - 24 = 48 feet.

To find out how much of the fence still needs to be whitewashed, we need to calculate the progress made by each friend and subtract it from the total length of the fence.

1. Ben's contribution: Ben whitewashed 10 feet.
2. Remaining fence after Ben: 100 feet - 10 feet = 90 feet.
3. Billy's contribution: Billy whitewashed a fifth of the remaining fence, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 90 = 18 \) feet.
4. Remaining fence after Billy: 90 feet - 18 feet = 72 feet.
5. Johnny's contribution: Johnny whitewashed a third of the remaining fence, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 72 = 24 \) feet.
6. Remaining fence after Johnny: 72 feet - 24 feet = 48 feet.
