Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister.
2. Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne.
3. Anne is 80cm tall.

First, we calculate the height of Anne's sister:
\[
\text{Height of Anne's sister} = \frac{\text{Height of Anne}}{2} = \frac{80\text{cm}}{2} = 40\text{cm}
\]

Next, we calculate the height of Bella, who is 3 times as tall as Anne:
\[
\text{Height of Bella} = \text{Height of Anne} \times 3 = 80\text{cm} \times 3 = 240\text{cm}
\]

Now, we find the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister:
\[
\text{Height difference} = \text{Height of Bella} - \text{Height of Anne's sister} = 240\text{cm} - 40\text{cm} = 200\text{cm}
\]

So, the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister is 200cm.

system
Let's denote Anne's height as \( A \) and her sister's height as \( S \).

Given that Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister, we can write:

\[ A = 2S \]

Given that Anne is 80cm tall, we can substitute \( A \) with 80:

\[ 80 = 2S \]

Solving for \( S \), the height of Anne's sister:

\[ S = \frac{80}{2} \]
\[ S = 40 \text{ cm} \]

Now, Bella's height is 3 times as tall as Anne, so:

\[ B = 3A \]

Substituting \( A \) with 80:

\[ B = 3 \times 80 \]
\[ B = 240 \text{ cm} \]

The height difference between Bella and Anne's sister is:

\[ B - S = 240 - 40 \]
\[ B - S = 200 \text{ cm} \]

Let's denote the height of Anne's sister as \( S \).

Given that Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister, we have:
\[ A = 2S \]

Where \( A \) is the height of Anne, which is given as 80 cm. So,
\[ 80 = 2S \]

From this equation, we can find \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ cm} \]

Now, Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne:
\[ B = 3A \]

Since \( A \) is 80 cm, the height of Bella is:
\[ B = 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ cm} \]

The height difference between Bella and Anne's sister is:
\[ \text{Height difference} = B - S \]
\[ = 240 - 40 \]
\[ = 200 \text{ cm} \]
