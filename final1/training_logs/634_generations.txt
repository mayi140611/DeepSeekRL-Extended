###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Tina is working on her homework when she realizes she's having a hard time typing out her answers on her laptop because a lot of the keys are sticky. She is trying to get her homework done before dinner, though, so she needs to decide if she has time to clean her keyboard first. Tina knows her assignment will only take 10 minutes to complete. Dinner will be ready at 5:30 p.m. Tina decides to time how long it takes to remove and clean one key and will then multiply that time by how many keys she needs to fix. She counts 15 keys that are sticky and times it to take 3 minutes to clean one. After Tina has cleaned one key, there are 14 left to clean. How many minutes total will it take for Tina to both clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment?

system
First, we need to determine the time it will take for Tina to clean the last 14 keys. Since it takes 3 minutes to clean one key, the time to clean 14 keys will be:

\[ 14 \text{ keys} \times 3 \text{ minutes/key} = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time including the time it took her to clean the first 15 keys and the time it took to finish her homework. She takes 10 minutes to finish her homework, and it took her 3 minutes to clean each of the first 15 keys.

So, the total time for the first 15 keys is:

\[ 15 \text{ keys} \times 3 \text{ minutes/key} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time for the last 14 keys and the time taken to finish her homework, the total time Tina will need is:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 42 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 97 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time will be \(97\) minutes.

To find out how many minutes it will take for Tina to clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Time to clean one key:** Tina times it to take 3 minutes to clean one key.
2. **Number of keys left to clean:** Tina counts 14 keys that are sticky after cleaning one key.

First, calculate the total time required to clean the remaining keys:

\[ \text{Total time to clean remaining keys} = \text{Number of remaining keys} \times \text{Time to clean one key} \]
\[ \text{Total time to clean remaining keys} = 14 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total time to clean remaining keys} = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add the time it takes to clean one key:

\[ \text{Total cleaning time} = \text{Time to clean one key} + \text{Total time to clean remaining keys} \]
\[ \text{Total cleaning time} = 3 + 42 \]
\[ \text{Total cleaning time} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add the time it takes Tina to complete her assignment, which is 10 minutes:

\[ \text{Total time needed} = \text{Total cleaning time} + \text{Time to complete assignment} \]
\[ \text{Total time needed} = 45 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Total time needed} = 55 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Tina 55 minutes in total to both clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment.

Reasoning:
1. Tina needs to clean each of the 15 sticky keys.
2. It takes her 3 minutes to clean one key.
3. After cleaning one key, there are 14 left to clean.

To find the total time required:
- Cleaning 1 key: 3 minutes
- Cleaning 14 keys: 14 * 3 minutes
- Adding the time for her assignment: 3 minutes

Total time: 3 minutes + (14 * 3 minutes) + 10 minutes

Answer:
Total time = 3 + 42 + 10 = 55 minutes

Therefore, it will take Tina 55 minutes total to both clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment.

Tina needs to clean 15 keys in total. If it takes her 3 minutes to clean one key, then cleaning 14 keys (excluding the first one she already cleaned) will take \( 14 \times 3 = 42 \) minutes. Adding the time it takes to clean the first key, which was 3 minutes, to the time for cleaning the remaining 14 keys, we get a total of \( 3 + 42 = 45 \) minutes.

Now, Tina needs to determine if she has enough time to finish her assignment in that time. Her assignment is only 10 minutes long, so it fits within the 45 minutes she has freed up for cleaning.

Therefore, the answer is she will have 45 minutes to both clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment.

To determine the total time it will take for Tina to clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment, we start by calculating the time it takes to clean the first key, which we know is 3 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many keys remain to be cleaned. Initially, there are 15 keys, and after cleaning one key, there are 14 keys left to clean.

The time required to clean one key is 3 minutes. Therefore, the time required to clean 14 keys is:
\[
14 \text{ keys} \times 3 \text{ minutes per key} = 42 \text{ minutes}
\]

It is given that Tina's assignment will take 10 minutes to complete. Therefore, the total time needed to both clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment is the sum of the time for the assignment and the time for cleaning the remaining keys:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} + 42 \text{ minutes} = 52 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take for Tina to clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment is \(\boxed{52}\) minutes.

To solve the problem, we first need to determine how much time Tina spends cleaning one key. She takes 3 minutes to clean one key.

Next, we need to find out how many keys remain to be cleaned after Tina has cleaned one key. Initially, there are 15 keys, and she cleaned one key. Therefore, there are 14 keys left to clean.

Now, we calculate the total time required to clean the remaining 14 keys. Since it takes 3 minutes to clean each key, we multiply the number of remaining keys by the time it takes to clean one key:

First, we need to calculate the time it takes to clean the remaining 14 keys. Since Tina already cleaned one key in 3 minutes, she has a total of 14 - 1 = 13 keys left to clean. Therefore, it will still take 3 minutes to clean each of the remaining 13 keys.

Next, we need to calculate the total time required to clean all 15 keys. Since it takes 3 minutes to clean one key, cleaning 15 keys will take 15 * 3 = 45 minutes.

Tina has 10 minutes to complete her assignment. Therefore, she needs to add the time taken to clean the keys to the time she has to finish her assignment. 10 + 45 = 55 minutes.

Tina's assignment will take 10 minutes. She counts 15 sticky keys and times cleaning one key to take 3 minutes. After cleaning one key, there are 14 keys left to clean. Tina will spend 3 minutes cleaning each of these remaining keys, so the time for the remaining keys is \(14 \times 3 = 42\) minutes. 

Thus, the total time spent cleaning will be the time for one key plus the time for the remaining keys: \(3 + 42 = 45\) minutes. Adding this to the time for her assignment, the total time will be \(10 + 45 = 55\) minutes.
