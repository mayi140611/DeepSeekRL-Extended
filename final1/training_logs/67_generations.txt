system
To find the average of their average that Jesse and Mia have to run over the final three days, we need to calculate the total miles they have to run, separately for Jesse and Mia, and then find the average of the miles they have to run together in the last three days.

For Jesse:
- In the first three days, Jesse averages (2/3) of a mile per day, so in three days she runs \(3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2\) miles.
- On the fourth day, she runs 10 miles.
- Therefore, in total, Jesse runs 2 + 10 = 12 miles in the first four days.
- To run 30 miles in one week, she has to run an average of \( \frac{30 - 12}{4} = \frac{18}{4} = 4.5 \) miles per day for the last three days.

For Mia:
- Mia averages 3 miles per day over the first four days, so she runs \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles in the first four days.
- To run 30 miles in one week, she has to run an average of \( \frac{30 - 12}{4} = \frac{18}{4} = 4.5 \) miles per day for the last three days.

Now, let's calculate the total miles they have to run in the final three days combined:
- Jesse will run 4.5 miles/day in the last three days.
- Mia will run 4.5 miles/day in the last three days.
- Therefore, together they will run \(4.5 + 4.5 = 9\) miles in the final three days.

Average of their average over the final three days:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days is 4.5 miles per day.

To find the average of their average running distance over the final three days, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the average of those distances.

**Jesse's Distance:**

Jesse runs \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a mile each day for the first three days. Sum of Jesse's distances for those three days:

\[
\text{Distance for Jesse} = 3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \text{ miles}
\]

On day four, Jesse runs 10 miles.

So, Jesse's total distance for the week:

\[
\text{Jesse's total distance} = 2 + 10 = 12 \text{ miles}
\]

**Mia's Distance:**

Mia runs 3 miles each day for the first four days. So, Mia's total distance for the week:

\[
\text{Mia's total distance} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ miles}
\]

**Average of their average:**

Now, we need to calculate their total distance for the final three days combined:

\[
\text{Total distance for final three days} = \text{Jesse's distance} + \text{Mia's distance}
\]

\[
\text{Total distance for final three days} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles}
\]

Divide this by the number of days (3) to find the average for those days:

\[
\text{Average distance for final three days} = \frac{24 \text{ miles}}{3} = 8 \text{ miles}
\]

To find the average of their average distances over the final three days, we take the average of Jesse's and Mia's final three-day averages:

\[
\text{Jesse's final three-day average} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ miles/day}
\]

\[
\text{Mia's final three-day average} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ miles/day}
\]

Taking the average of this pair (one for Jesse and one for Mia):

\[
\text{Average of their average} = \frac{2.67 \text{ miles/day} + 2.67 \text{ miles/day}}{2} = 2.67 \text{ miles/day}
\]

So, the average distance that Jesse and Mia have to run over the final three days is approximately 2.67 miles per day.

To find the average of their averages, we first need to determine the total miles each person has run so far and the miles they have left to run.

For Jesse:
- In the first three days, she runs (2/3) of a mile each day. So for three days, she runs \(3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2\) miles.
- On the fourth day, she runs 10 miles.
- So far, Jesse has run \(2 + 10 = 12\) miles.
- She has 30 - 12 = 18 miles left to run over the final three days.

For Mia:
- Mia averages 3 miles a day for the first 4 days. So for four days, she runs \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles.
- She has 30 - 12 = 18 miles left to run over the final three days as well.

Now, we find the average of the miles they have left to run:
- Jesse has 18 miles left to run over three days, so her average for the final three days is \(18 \div 3 = 6\) miles per day.
- Mia has 18 miles left to run over three days, so her average for the final three days is also \(18 \div 3 = 6\) miles per day.

The average of their averages is:
- \(6 + 6 = 12\) miles per day.

Therefore, the answer is 12.

To find the average of their respective average speeds over the final three days, we first need to calculate the total distance and total time for each individual.

First, for Jesse:
- Jesse averages \((2/3)\) of a mile each day over the first three days, so in total:
  \[
  \text{Distance in first three days} = 3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3} \text{ miles/day}\right) = 2 \text{ miles}
  \]
- On the fourth day, Jesse runs 10 miles in total.
Thus, the total distance Jesse runs over the week is:
  \[
  2 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}
  \]
- The time over these three days (4 days in total) is:
  \[
  4 \text{ days}
  \]

Average distance run per day for Jesse:
  \[
  \text{Average distance per day} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ days}} = 3 \text{ miles/day}
  \]

Now, for Mia:
- Mia averages 3 miles per day over the first four days, so:
  \[
  \text{Distance over the first three days} = 4 \times 3 \text{ miles/day} = 12 \text{ miles}
  \]
- She also runs 10 miles on day 4.
Thus, the total distance Mia runs over the week is:
  \[
  12 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 22 \text{ miles}
  \]
- The time over these four days is:
  \[
  4 \text{ days}
  \]

Average distance run per day for Mia:
  \[
  \text{Average distance per day} = \frac{22 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ days}} = 5.5 \text{ miles/day}
  \]

Next, to find the average of their average speeds over the final three days:
- For Jesse:
  \[
  \text{Average speed for Jesse} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 10 \text{ miles/day}
  \]
- For Mia:
  \[
  \text{Average speed for Mia} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 10 \text{ miles/day}
  \]

Thus, the average of their average speeds over the final three days is:
  \[
  \frac{10 \text{ miles/day} + 10 \text{ miles/day}}{2} = 10 \text{ miles/day}
  \]
  
Final answer: The average of their average speeds over the final three days is \(10\) miles/day.

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total distance each person has run over the first four days and then determine the remaining distance they need to run to meet their goal of 30 miles.

For Jesse:
- In the first three days, she averages \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a mile per day, so in three days she runs \(3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2\) miles.
- On day four, she runs 10 miles.
- Therefore, the total distance she runs in four days is \(2 + 10 = 12\) miles.
- To meet her goal of 30 miles, she needs to run an additional \(30 - 12 = 18\) miles over the final three days.

For Mia:
- Mia averages 3 miles per day over the first four days, so she runs \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles.
- To meet her goal of 30 miles, she needs to run an additional \(30 - 12 = 18\) miles over the final three days.

Now we calculate the average distance Mia needs to run each day over the final three days:
\[ \text{Average distance per day for Mia} = \frac{18 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we determine the combined total distance they need to run over the final three days:
\[ \text{Total distance for Jesse} + \text{Total distance for Mia} = 18 \text{ miles} + 18 \text{ miles} = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we calculate the average distance they need to run per day over the final three days:
\[ \text{Average distance per day for both} = \frac{36 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days is \(12\) miles per day.

To find the average of their averages, we first need to determine the total miles run by Jesse and Mia over the entire week.

**Jesse's Mileage:**
- On the first three days, Jesse averages \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile per day.
- For the first three days: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3 = 2 \) miles.
- On the fourth day: 10 miles.
- Total miles over the first four days: \( 2 + 10 = 12 \) miles.

**Mia's Mileage:**
- Mia averages 3 miles per day over the first 4 days.
- Total miles over the first four days: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) miles.

**Total Miles for the Week:**
- Jesse: 30 miles total.
- Mia: 30 miles total.

**Total Miles to be Run by Both Over the Final Three Days:**
- Total miles for both: \( 30 + 30 = 60 \) miles.
- Total days remaining: 3 days.

**Average Miles to Run by Both Over the Final Three Days:**
- If 60 miles are to be run over 3 days, then the average is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) miles per day.

The average of their averages over the final three days is 20 miles per day.

Therefore, the reasoning given is correct. The average that Jesse and Mia have to run over the final three days is 20 miles per day.

**Answer:**
The average of their averages over the final three days is 20 miles per day.

To find the average of their average that Jesse and Mia have to run over the final three days, we need to calculate their total miles run over the week and determine how far they each have left to run.

First, calculate the total miles Jesse runs over the first four days:

\[ \text{Miles run by Jesse} = 3 \text{ days} \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ mile/day} + 10 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Miles run by Jesse} = 2 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, calculate the total miles Mia runs over the first four days:

\[ \text{Miles run by Mia} = 4 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ miles/day} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, calculate the total miles they have run together over the first four days:

\[ \text{Total miles run} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Since they have one week to run 30 miles, the total distance left to run is:

\[ \text{Distance left} = 30 \text{ miles} - 24 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Since they have only three days to run the remaining 6 miles, the average distance they need to run per day is:

\[ \text{Average distance per day} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ miles/day} \]

The average of their averages that they have to run over the final three days is:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/day}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/day} \]

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{1 \text{ mile/day}} \]

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total miles each of them has run in the first four days and then determine the average amount they have to run over the final three days.

First, let's calculate the total miles Jesse has run in the first four days:
- On the first three days, Jesse averages \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a mile per day. So for three days, she runs \(3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2\) miles.
- On the fourth day, she runs 10 miles.

So in total for the first four days, Jesse has run \(2 + 10 = 12\) miles.

Next, let's calculate the total miles Mia has run in the first four days:
- Mia averages 3 miles a day for four days. So for four days, she runs \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles.

Now, we know that both Jesse and Mia have 30 - 12 = 18 miles left to run over the final three days.

The average mileage each has to run per day over the final three days is:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we'll calculate the average of their averages over the final three days:
\[ \frac{(2 + 10) \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ miles/day for Jesse} \]
\[ \frac{(3 + 3)}{3 \text{ days}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ miles/day for Mia} \]

Now we find the average of their averages:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ miles/day} + 2 \text{ miles/day}}{2} = \frac{6 \text{ miles/day}}{2} = 3 \text{ miles/day} \]

So the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days is 3 miles/day.

First, let's calculate the total distance Jesse has already run:
E. Day 1: Jesse averages (2/3) of a mile per day for 3 days, so he has run 2 miles so far.
E. Day 2: Same as Day 1.
E. Day 3: Same as Day 1.
E. Day 4: She runs 10 miles.
For the initial 4 days combined:
2 + 2 + 2 + 10 = 16 miles

Now, Jesse has a total of 30 - 16 = 14 miles to run over the final 3 days.

Mia averages 3 miles per day over the first 4 days:
For the first 4 days: 3 miles/day * 4 days = 12 miles

Mia has 30 total miles minus the 12 miles she has already run:
30 - 12 = 18 miles remaining for Mia

For the final 3 days, we calculate the average miles she has left to run:
18 miles / 3 days = 6 miles per day

Now, let's calculate Jesse's average distance per day for the final 3 days:
14 miles / 3 days = 4.67 miles per day (rounded to 2 decimal places)

For Mia, her total average for her 3 days of running:
18 miles / 3 days = 6 miles per day

Finally, we add both averages together:
4.67 + 6 = 10.67 miles per day

So, the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days is 10.67 miles per day.

Jesse’s first three days run total 3 * (2/3) = 2 miles. This means that Jesse has 30 – 2 - 10 = 18 miles left to run. Thus, she needs to run an average of 18 / 3 = 6 miles a day for the last three days.

Mia’s first four days run total 4 * 3 = 12 miles. This means that she has 30 – 12 = 18 miles left to run. Thus, she needs to run an average of 18 / 3 = 6 miles a day for the last three days.

Jesse’s average is 6 and Mia’s average is 6. Their combined average is 6 + 6 = 12 miles a day.

To find the average of their average for the final three days, we first need to calculate the total distance each has run for the first seven days.

For Jesse:
- For the first three days, she runs \(3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2\) miles.
- On the fourth day, she runs 10 miles.
- So, the total distance Jesse runs for the first three days is \(2\) miles, and over the first four days is \(2 + 10 = 12\) miles.

For Mia:
- She averages 3 miles per day over the first four days, so the total distance she runs in four days is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles.

Now, we need to calculate the difference between the total distance of the race and the distance they each have run so far. The race total is 30 miles, so they together have run \(12 + 12 = 24\) miles.

They have three days left to run, so the average distance they each need to run per day over these final three days is:
- For Jesse: \(\frac{30 - 24}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2\) miles per day.
- For Mia: \(\frac{30 - 24}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2\) miles per day.

Since they need to run the same distance per day, their average for the final three days is the same for either of them, which is \(2\) miles per day.

To determine the average miles that Jesse and Mia need to run over the final three days to complete the 30-mile race, we first calculate the miles each has already completed.

For Jesse:
- On the first three days, she averages \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile per day. So for three days, she runs \( 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \) miles.
- On the fourth day, she runs 10 miles.
- Therefore, in the first four days, Jesse runs \( 2 + 10 = 12 \) miles.

For Mia:
- She averages 3 miles per day over the first four days, so for four days, she runs \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) miles.

Next, we calculate the remaining miles each needs to run over the final three days:
- Jesse still needs to run \( 30 - 12 = 18 \) miles over the final three days.
- Mia still needs to run \( 30 - 12 = 18 \) miles over the final three days.

Now, we find the average miles each has to run per day for the final three days:
- Jesse needs to run \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) miles per day over the final three days.
- Mia needs to run \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) miles per day over the final three days.

The average number of miles they each have to run per day over the final three days is 6 miles.

To find the average distance Jesse has to run each of the final three days, we first calculate the total distance she needs to cover by the end of the week. 

First, let's calculate the distance Jesse has covered in the first three days: 
\[ \text{Distance covered in first three days} = 3 \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ miles/day} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distance she ran on day four:
\[ \text{Total distance Jesse has run by the end of day four} = 2 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

This means Jesse needs to run:
\[ 30 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

in the final three days. Therefore, in the final three days, Jesse needs to average:
\[ \text{Average miles per day} = \frac{18 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ miles/day} \]

Mia averages 3 miles a day over the first four days, so to find the average that she has to run over the final three days, we calculate:
\[ \text{Distance Mia has run in the first four days} = 4 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ miles/day} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

This means Mia needs to run:
\[ 30 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

in the final three days. Therefore, in the final three days, Mia needs to average:
\[ \text{Average miles per day} = \frac{18 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ miles/day} \]

Since both Jesse and Mia have to average 6 miles per day over the final three days, their average of the average they have to run over the final three days is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles/day} + 6 \text{ miles/day} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total average distance they need to run over the final three days.
\[ \text{Total average miles per day} = 6 \text{ miles/day} + 6 \text{ miles/day} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \]

Hence, the average distance they have to run over the final three days is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now we can calculate the total average distance they need to run over the final three days.
\[ \text{Total average miles} = \text{Total average miles per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the average that Jesse and Mia have to run over the final three days is:

To find the average of their average, we need to first calculate the total distance each has run in the first four days and then subtract that from the total distance of 30 miles for each to find the remaining distance they need to run over the final three days.

Jesse's scenario:
On the first three days, she averages (2/3) of a mile per day, so in total she runs:
\[ 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

On day four, she runs 10 miles.

So in the first four days, Jesse runs:
\[ 2 + 10 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

This leaves her with:
\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \text{ miles} \] for the final three days.

Mia's scenario:
Over the first four days, Mia averages 3 miles per day, so:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

This leaves her with:
\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \text{ miles} \] for the final three days.

Now to find the average of their average:
\[ \frac{18 (Jesse's average) + 18 (Mia's average)}{2 \text{ athletes}} \]
\[ \frac{18 + 18}{2} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ miles per day} \]

So the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days is 18 miles.

- Day three: (2/3) miles
- Day four: 10 miles

Total distance Jesse runs in the first four days = (2/3) + (2/3) + (2/3) + 10
Total distance Jesse runs in the first four days = 2/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 + 10
Total distance Jesse runs in the first four days = 6/3 + 10
Total distance Jesse runs in the first four days = 2 + 10
Total distance Jesse runs in the first four days = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance Mia runs in the first four days:
Total distance Mia runs in the first four days = 3 miles/day * 4 days = 12 miles

Both Jesse and Mia need to run a total of 30 miles over the week. Let's find out how much they have left to run:
Total distance needed: 30 miles
Distance already run (jose): 12 miles
Distance already run (mia): 12 miles
Distance remaining for Jesse: 30 - 12 = 18 miles
Distance remaining for Mia: 30 - 12 = 18 miles

Now, we find the average distance they each need to run over the final three days:
- Jesse needs to run an average of 18 miles / 3 days = 6 miles/day
- Mia needs to run an average of 18 miles / 3 days = 6 miles/day

Therefore, both Jesse and Mia have to run the same average of 6 miles per day over the final three days to complete the race.
