#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Ann bakes a total of 3 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies + 2 dozen sugar cookies + 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies = 9 dozen or 108 cookies.
She gives away a total of 2 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies + 1.5 dozen sugar cookies + 2.5 dozen chocolate chip cookies = 6 dozen or 72 cookies.
So she keeps 108 cookies - 72 cookies = 36.

Ann bakes a total of 3 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies + 2 dozen sugar cookies + 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies = 9 dozen cookies.

Ann gives away 2 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies + 1.5 dozen sugar cookies + 2.5 dozen chocolate chip cookies = 6 dozen cookies.

Ann keeps a total of 9 dozen cookies - 6 dozen cookies given away = 3 dozen cookies.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Ann initially baked:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 cookies
- Sugar cookies: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 cookies

Next, let's calculate the number of cookies Ann gives away:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- Sugar cookies: 1.5 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 cookies
- Chocolate chip cookies: 2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 12 = 30 cookies

Now, let's find out how many cookies Ann keeps by subtracting the cookies given away from the initial totals:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies: 36 - 24 = 12 cookies kept
- Sugar cookies: 24 - 18 = 6 cookies kept
- Chocolate chip cookies: 48 - 30 = 18 cookies kept

Finally, let's add up the remaining cookies:

- Total cookies kept: 12 (oatmeal raisin) + 6 (sugar) + 18 (chocolate chip) = 36 cookies

Ann initially baked:
- 3 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies = 3 * 12 = 36 cookies
- 2 dozen sugar cookies = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies = 4 * 12 = 48 cookies

After giving away some cookies:
- 2 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies given away = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- 1.5 dozen sugar cookies given away = 1.5 * 12 = 18 cookies
- 2.5 dozen chocolate chip cookies given away = 2.5 * 12 = 30 cookies

To find out how many cookies Ann kept, we subtract the number of cookies given away from the initial number of each type of cookie:
- Oatmeal raisin cookies kept = 36 - 24 = 12 cookies
- Sugar cookies kept = 24 - 18 = 6 cookies
- Chocolate chip cookies kept = 48 - 30 = 18 cookies

Now, we sum the cookies she kept:
- Total cookies kept = 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 cookies

Ann baked a total of \(3 \times 12 + 2 \times 12 + 4 \times 12 = 36 + 24 + 48 = 108\) cookies.

She gave away a total of \(2 \times 12 + 1.5 \times 12 + 2.5 \times 12 = 24 + 18 + 30 = 72\) cookies.

Therefore, the total number of cookies Ann keeps is \(108 - 72 = 36\).

Ann initially bakes:
- 3 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies = 3 * 12 = 36 cookies
- 2 dozen sugar cookies = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies = 4 * 12 = 48 cookies

She gives away:

- 1.5 dozen sugar cookies = 1.5 * 12 = 18 cookies
- 2.5 dozen chocolate chip cookies = 2.5 * 12 = 30 cookies

To find the total number of cookies Ann keeps, we subtract the number of cookies she gives away from the initial amount:
- Total oatmeal raisin cookies left = Initial oaten raisin cookies - Given oaten raisin cookies = 36 - 24 = 12 cookies
- Total sugar cookies left = Initial sugar cookies - Given sugar cookies = 24 - 18 = 6 cookies
- Total chocolate chip cookies left = Initial chocolate chip cookies - Given chocolate chip cookies = 48 - 30 = 18 cookies

Now, we add up the leftover cookies to find the total:
- Total cookies Ann keeps = Total oaten raisin cookies left + Total sugar cookies left + Total chocolate chip cookies left = 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 cookies

Reasoning:
First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Ann initially baked:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 cookies
- Sugar cookies: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 cookies

Total initial cookies = 36 + 24 + 48 = 108 cookies.

Next, let's calculate how many cookies Ann gave away:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies given away: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- Sugar cookies given away: 1.5 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 cookies
- Chocolate chip cookies given away: 2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 12 = 30 cookies

Total cookies given away = 24 + 18 + 30 = 72 cookies.

Finally, let's calculate the number of cookies Ann keeps:

Total cookies kept = Total initial cookies - Total cookies given away = 108 - 72 = 36 cookies.

She had 3 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies and gave away 2 dozen, so she kept 3 - 2 = 1 dozen, which is 12 * 1 = 12 oatmeal cookies.

She had 2 dozen sugar cookies and gave away 1.5 dozen, so she kept 2 - 1.5 = 0.5 dozen, which is 0.5 * 12 = 6 sugar cookies.

She had 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies and gave away 2.5 dozen, so she kept 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 dozen, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 chocolate chip cookies.

So the total number of cookies she kept is 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 cookies.

First, we calculate the initial quantities of each type of cookie Ann has:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 cookies.
- Sugar cookies: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies.
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 cookies.

Next, we account for the cookies Ann gives away:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies given away: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies.
- Sugar cookies given away: 1.5 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 cookies.
- Chocolate chip cookies given away: 2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 12 = 30 cookies.

Now, we subtract the given cookies from the initial quantities to find out how many cookies Ann keeps:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies kept: 36 - 24 = 12 cookies.
- Sugar cookies kept: 24 - 18 = 6 cookies.
- Chocolate chip cookies kept: 48 - 30 = 18 cookies.

Finally, we add the kept cookies together to get the total number of cookies Ann keeps:

- Total cookies kept: 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 cookies.

Ann bakes a total of \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) oatmeal raisin cookies. Two dozen sugar cookies equals \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \). Four dozen chocolate chip cookies are \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \). Ann gives away \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) oatmeal raisin cookies, \( 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \) sugar cookies, and \( 2.5 \times 12 = 30 \) chocolate chips cookies. After giving away the cookies, Ann keeps \( 36 - 24 = 12 \) oatmeal cookies, \( 24 - 18 = 6 \) sugar cookies, and \( 48 - 30 = 18 \) chocolate chip cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies Ann keeps is \( 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 \).

Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we calculate the total number of each type of cookie Ann bakes:
- Oatmeal raisin cookies: \(3 \times 12 = 36\)
- Sugar cookies: \(2 \times 12 = 24\)
- Chocolate chip cookies: \(4 \times 12 = 48\)

Next, we determine how many of each type of cookie Ann gives away:
- Oatmeal raisin cookies given away: \(2 \times 12 = 24\)
- Sugar cookies given away: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\)
- Chocolate chip cookies given away: \(2.5 \times 12 = 30\)

Now, we calculate the number of each type of cookie Ann keeps:
- Oatmeal raisin cookies kept: \(36 - 24 = 12\)
- Sugar cookies kept: \(24 - 18 = 6\)
- Chocolate chip cookies kept: \(48 - 30 = 18\)

Finally, we sum the number of each type of cookie to find the total number of cookies Ann keeps:
\[12 + 6 + 18 = 36\]

To determine how many cookies Ann keeps, we need to calculate the total number of each type of cookie she bakes and then subtract the number she gives away.

First, calculate the total number of each type of cookie:
- Oatmeal raisin cookies: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 cookies
- Sugar cookies: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 cookies

Next, determine the number of each type of cookie Ann gives away:
- Oatmeal raisin cookies: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- Sugar cookies: 1.5 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 cookies
- Chocolate chip cookies: 2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 12 = 30 cookies

Now, calculate the number of each type of cookie Ann keeps by subtracting the given away amounts from the baked amounts:
- Oatmeal raisin cookies kept: 36 - 24 = 12 cookies
- Sugar cookies kept: 24 - 18 = 6 cookies
- Chocolate chip cookies kept: 48 - 30 = 18 cookies

Finally, sum the cookies kept:
12 (oatmeal raisin) + 6 (sugar) + 18 (chocolate chip) = 36 cookies

So, Ann keeps a total of 36 cookies.
