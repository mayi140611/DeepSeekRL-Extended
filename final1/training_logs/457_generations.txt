66
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the number of votes Joey got as \( J \). According to the problem, Joey got 8 votes, so \( J = 8 \).

Joey got 3 more votes than the number of votes Marcy got, so Marcy's votes can be expressed as \( C \):
\[ C = J - 3 \]
\[ C = 8 - 3 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

Barry got twice as many votes as Marcy, so Barry's votes can be expressed as \( B \):
\[ B = 2 \times C \]
\[ B = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ B = 10 \]

Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry, so Marcy's votes can be expressed as \( M \):
\[ M = 3 \times B \]
\[ M = 3 \times 10 \]
\[ M = 30 \]

Therefore, Marcy got 30 votes.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joey got 8 votes.
2. Barry got twice as many votes as 3 more than the number of votes Joey got. So, Barry got \(2 \times (8 + 3) = 2 \times 11 = 22\) votes.
3. Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry. So, Marcy got \(3 \times 22 = 66\) votes.

To determine how many votes Marcy got, we need to follow the reasoning through the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of votes Joey got:** Joey got 8 votes.

2. **Determine the number of votes Barry got based on Joey's votes:** Barry got twice as many votes as 3 more than the number of votes Joey got.
   - Twice as many as 3 more than 8 votes is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Votes for Barry} = 2 \times (8 + 3) = 2 \times 11 = 22
     \]

3. **Determine the number of votes Marcy got based on Barry's votes:** Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry.
   - Three times as many as 22 votes is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Votes for Marcy} = 3 \times 22 = 66
     \]

**Conclusion:** Marcy got 66 votes.

To determine how many votes Marcy received, we need to work backwards from the information given about Joey's votes.

1. Joey received 8 votes.
2. Barry got twice as many votes as 3 more than Joey's votes. This can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   3 + 8 = 11
   \]
   So, Barry received \(2 \times 11 = 22\) votes.
3. Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry. This can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   3 \times 22 = 66
   \]

Therefore, Marcy got 66 votes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are given that Joey got 8 votes.
2. Barry got twice as many votes as 3 more than Joey's votes.
3. Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry.

First, calculate how many votes Barry got:
\[
\text{Barry's votes} = 2 \times (8 + 3)
\]
\[
\text{Barry's votes} = 2 \times 11 = 22
\]

Next, calculate how many votes Marcy got:
\[
\text{Marcy's votes} = 3 \times \text{Barry's votes}
\]
\[
\text{Marcy's votes} = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

So, Marcy got 66 votes.

Let's denote the number of votes Joey got as \( J \). According to the problem, \( J = 8 \).

Barry received twice as many votes as 3 more than the number of votes Joey got. Therefore, the number of votes Barry got is:

\[
B = 2 \times (J + 3) = 2 \times (8 + 3) = 2 \times 11 = 22
\]

Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry. Therefore, the number of votes Marcy got is:

\[
M = 3 \times B = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

So, Marcy got 66 votes.

Let's determine the number of votes Barry got first. We know Joey got 8 votes, and Barry got twice as many as 3 more than Joey's votes. So, we calculate that 3 more than Joey's votes are \(3 + 8 = 11\). Therefore, Barry got \(2 \times 11 = 22\) votes. 

Next, we know that Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry. Since Barry got 22 votes, Marcy got \(3 \times 22 = 66\) votes.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Joey's votes**: Joey got 8 votes. We denote this as \( J = 8 \).
2. **Barry's votes**: Barry got twice as many votes as 3 more than the number of votes Joey got.
   - First, calculate 3 more than the number of votes Joey got: \( 8 + 3 = 11 \).
   - Then, Barry got twice this amount: \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \). We denote this as \( B = 22 \).
3. **Marcy's votes**: Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry.
   - Marcy's votes are three times Barry's votes: \( M = 3 \times B \).
   - Substituting \( B \) with 22: \( M = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).

Now, we can write the final answer:

<answer>
66
</answer>
<reasoning>
We started by finding out how many votes Joey got, which is 8. Next, we calculated how many votes Barry got, which was twice 3 more than Joey's votes, and found it to be 22. Finally, we found out how many votes Marcy got, which is three times Barry's votes, and found it to be 66.
</reasoning>

Therefore, the number of votes Marcy got is 66.

Let's determine the number of votes Joey got, which is given as 8 votes.

Joey's votes = 8 votes

Barry got twice as many votes as 3 more than the number of votes Joey got:
Barry's votes = 2 * (3 + Joey's votes)
Barry's votes = 2 * (3 + 8)
Barry's votes = 2 * 11
Barry's votes = 22 votes

Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry:
Marcy's votes = 3 * Barry's votes
Marcy's votes = 3 * 22
Marcy's votes = 66 votes

Therefore, the answer is 66 votes.
