Each unicorn moves 3 meters forward with each step. To find out how many steps each unicorn takes in 9 kilometers (which is 9,000 meters), we divide the total distance by the distance per step:
$$ \frac{9000\,meters}{3\,meters/step} = 3000 \,steps/unicorn $$

With 6 unicorns, the total number of steps is:
$$ 3000 \,steps/unicorn \times 6 \,unicorns = 18000 \,steps $$

Each step by a unicorn causes 4 flowers to bloom, leading to a total of:
$$ 18000 \,steps \times 4 \,flowers/step = 72000 \,flowers $$

Therefore, the flowers that bloom because of the unicorns' journey are 72,000.

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of steps taken by all the unicorns during their journey across the forest. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The total distance of the journey is 9 kilometers. Since each step moves the unicorn 3 meters, the total number of steps can be calculated by:
   \[
   \text{Total steps} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Step length}} = \frac{9 \text{ km}}{3 \text{ m}} = \frac{9000 \text{ m}}{3} = 3000 \text{ steps}
   \]

2. Each unicorn steps 4 flowers every time, and there are six unicorns. Therefore, the number of flowers that bloom because of this trip is:
   \[
   \text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of unicorns} \times \text{Flowers per unicorn step} \times \text{Total steps} = 6 \times 4 \times 3000 = 72000
   \]

3. Hence, 72,000 flowers will bloom because of the unicorns' journey.

Each unicorn moves 3 meters forward with each step. Since they are walking a journey of 9 kilometers (which is 9,000 meters), each unicorn will take \( 9,000 \div 3 = 3,000 \) steps. As there are 6 unicorns, the total number of steps will be \( 3,000 \times 6 = 18,000 \) steps.

Since every step a unicorn takes causes 4 flowers to bloom, the total number of flowers that will bloom during the journey will be \( 18,000 \times 4 = 72,000 \).

To determine how many flowers bloom because of the unicorns' trip, we need to calculate the total distance covered by all the unicorns and then determine how many blooms this distance results in based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the total distance each unicorn covers:
- Each unicorn moves 3 meters forward per step.
- The unicorns are walking a total distance of 9 kilometers, which is equivalent to 9,000 meters (since there are 1,000 meters in a kilometer).

If each unicorn covers 3 meters per step, the total steps each unicorn takes will be:
\[ \text{Total steps per unicorn} = \frac{9,000 \text{ meters}}{3 \text{ meters/step}} = 3,000 \text{ steps} \]

Since there are 6 unicorns, the total number of steps taken collectively is:
\[ \text{Total steps} = 6 \text{ unicorns} \times 3,000 \text{ steps/unicorn} = 18,000 \text{ steps} \]

According to the problem, each step results in 4 flowers blooming. Therefore, the total number of flowers that bloom is:
\[ \text{Total flowers} = 18,000 \text{ steps} \times 4 \text{ flowers/step} = 72,000 \text{ flowers} \]

Thus, the number of flowers that bloom is 72,000.

To determine how many flowers bloom, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance traveled by all six unicorns.
2. Determine the number of steps each unicorn takes.
3. Calculate the total number of steps taken by all unicorns combined.
4. Use the given condition that four flowers bloom for each step to find the total number of flowers that bloom.

Firstly, there are 6 unicorns and they are walking 9 kilometers. To convert kilometers to meters (since 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters), we get:
\[ 9 \text{ km} = 9 \times 1000 \text{ m} = 9000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, each unicorn moves 3 meters per step. Therefore, each unicorn's total distance traveled is:
\[ 6 \text{ unicorns} \times 3 \text{ meters/step} = 18 \text{ meters/unicorn} \]

Next, we need to find out how many steps each unicorn takes to travel 18 meters. Since 18 meters is:
\[ 18 \text{ meters} / 3 \text{ meters/step} = 6 \text{ steps/unicorn} \]

Therefore, each unicorn makes 6 steps. With 6 unicorns, the total number of steps taken is:
\[ 6 \text{ unicorns} \times 6 \text{ steps/unicorn} = 36 \text{ steps} \]

Finally, knowing each step results in 4 flowers blooming, we calculate the total number of flowers that bloom as:
\[ 36 \text{ steps} \times 4 \text{ flowers/step} = 144 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the total number of flowers that bloom is:
\[ 144 \]

To find out how many flowers bloom, we first need to figure out how many steps each unicorn takes to walk 9 kilometers. Since each step is 3 meters, we can calculate the number of steps per unicorn as follows:
$$
\text{Steps per unicorn} = \frac{9,000 \text{ meters}}{3 \text{ meters/step}} = 3,000 \text{ steps}
$$

Now that we know each unicorn takes 3,000 steps, we can find out how many steps all the unicorns will take together.
$$
2 \text{ unicorns} \times 3,000 \text{ steps/unicorn} = 6,000 \text{ steps}
$$

With each step, 4 flowers bloom. So, to find the total number of flowers that bloom, we multiply the number of steps by the number of flowers per step.
$$
6,000 \text{ steps} \times 4 \text{ flowers/steps} = 24,000 \text{ flowers}
$$

Thus, a total of 24,000 flowers will bloom during all six unicorns' journey.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, let's determine how many steps each unicorn takes to cover the 9 kilometers journey. Since we need to convert this distance into meters (as each step is 3 meters), 9 kilometers is equivalent to 9,000 meters.

The number of steps each unicorn takes is:
\[ \frac{9,000 \text{ meters}}{3 \text{ meters/step}} = 3,000 \text{ steps} \]

If each step by a unicorn causes 4 flowers to bloom, then 3,000 steps by 6 unicorns will cause:
\[ 3,000 \text{ steps/unicorn} \times 6 \text{ unicorns} \times 4 \text{ flowers/step} = 72,000 \text{ flowers} \]

To determine how many flowers bloom, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the journey distance from kilometers to meters.
2. Determine how many steps each unicorn takes.
3. Calculate the total number of steps for all the unicorns.
4. Calculate the total number of flowers that bloom because of all the steps.

**Step 1: Convert the journey distance from kilometers to meters.**
\[ 9 \text{ kilometers} = 9 \times 1000 = 9000 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many steps each unicorn takes.**
Each step is 3 meters, so each unicorn takes:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ meters}}{3 \text{ meters/step}} = 3000 \text{ steps} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of steps for all the unicorns.**
There are 6 unicorns, so the total number of steps is:
\[ 6 \times 3000 \text{ steps} = 18000 \text{ steps} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of flowers that bloom because of all the steps.**
Since each step causes 4 flowers to bloom, the total number of flowers that bloom is:
\[ 18000 \text{ steps} \times 4 \text{ flowers/step} = 72000 \text{ flowers} \]

Therefore, 72000 flowers bloom because of the trip.

Each unicorn stomps 3 meters with each step. With 6 unicorns stepping together, 6 unicorns * 3 meters = 18 meters per group of steps. When they move 9 kilometers, which is 9,000 meters, then the number of times they will step is 9,000 meters total distance / 18 meters per group = 500 group set-steps. Each time each group of steps is taken, 4 flowers bloom. So there will be 500 groups of steps * 4 flowers = 2000 flowers that bloom.

To find out how many flowers bloom during the trip, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled by all the unicorns combined. Since each unicorn moves 3 meters forward with each step and they step every four flowers spring, we can determine the distance the unicorns travel per step by multiplying 3 meters by 4 flowers, resulting in 12 meters per step.

The total distance of the journey is 9 kilometers, which can be converted to meters by multiplying by 1000, resulting in 9,000 meters.

To find out how many steps are taken in 9,000 meters, we divide the total distance by the distance of each step:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ meters}}{12 \text{ meters/step}} = 750 \text{ steps} \]

Each step causes the blossoming of 4 flowers. Therefore, over 750 steps, the total number of flowers that bloom is:
\[ 750 \text{ steps} \times 4 \text{ flowers/step} = 3000 \text{ flowers} \]

So, a total of 3000 flowers bloom as a result of their journey.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many steps the unicorns will make and then determine how many flowers bloom based on the number of steps.

1. **Determine the total distance each unicorn will cover:**
   - The journey is 9 kilometers.
   - Since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters, the total distance is 9 * 1000 = 9000 meters.
   - Since there are 6 unicorns, each unicorn will contribute 9000 / 6 = 1500 meters towards the total.

2. **Calculate the number of steps each unicorn will take:**
   - Each step covers 3 meters.
   - Therefore, each unicorn will take 1500 / 3 = 500 steps.

3. **Calculate the total number of steps for all the unicorns:**
   - There are 6 unicorns, each taking 500 steps.
   - This makes a total of 6 * 500 = 3000 steps.

4. **Calculate the total number of flowers that bloom:**
   - Since every step a unicorn takes, 4 flowers bloom.
   - Therefore, 3000 steps will result in 3000 * 4 = 12,000 flowers blooming.

So, all combined, 12,000 flowers bloom because of this trip.

A unicorn steps on four flowers per journey, which is a journey covering 9 kilometers (or 9,000 meters). This means each journey covers \(4 \times 9000 = 36000\) flowers.

The total journey is 9 kilometers (or 9,000 meters), with six unicorns all walking side by side. The total distance per step for the unicorns is 3 meters forward. To find out how many steps each unicorn takes, add up the 3 meters for each step forward, then divide by the 3 meters per step to get the number of steps.

So each step will be \(9000 / 3 = 3000\) meters long. So each path of steps will be \(6 \times 3000 = 18000\) meters or 18 kilometers long. For each of these, four flowers spring and bloom. Therefore, the total number of flowers that bloom because of the trip of the six unicorns will be \(18 \times 4 = 72\) flowers. 

Let's check the reasoning: each unicorn steps 12,000 times (or \(4 \times 3000\)), so for 6 unicorns it will be \(12,000 \times 6 = 72,000\) footsteps, and for each step, 4 florets bloom, which means \(72,000 \times 4 = 288,000\) florets bloom.

First, we need to calculate the total distance each unicorn steps forward and how many steps it takes to cover 9 kilometers. Since each unicorn moves 3 meters with each step:

- A journey of 9 kilometers is equivalent to \( 9,000 \) meters.
- Distance per step for each unicorn: \( 3 \) meters.

Next, the number of steps each unicorn makes can be found by dividing the total distance by the distance per step:
\[ \text{Number of steps} = \frac{9,000 \text{ meters}}{3 \text{ meters / step}} = 3,000 \text{ steps} \]

Since the unicorns move in a line side-by-side:
\[ 3,000 \text{ steps} \times 6 \text{ unicorns} = 18,000 \text{ steps} \]

Every step results in 4 flowers blooming. Therefore, the total number of flowers that bloom is:
\[ 18,000 \text{ steps} \times 4 \text{ flowers / step} = 72,000 \text{ flowers} \]

Thus, 72,000 flowers bloom because of the unicorns' journey across the forest.

We first need to calculate the total distance in meters that the unicorns will cover. Since the journey is 9 kilometers, we convert this to meters: \(9 \text{ km} \times 1000 \text{ m/km} = 9000 \text{ m}\).

Next, we determine how far each unicorn moves in total. Since each step is 3 meters and there are 6 unicorns taking a step together, and given that every unicorn moves 3 meters with each step, we can calculate the distance each unicorn covers:
\[ \text{Distance per unicorn} = 3 \text{ m} \times 6 = 18 \text{ m} \]

Now, we can calculate how many times each unicorn needs to go for 18 meters. Since each step is 3 meters:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ m}}{3 \text{ m/step}} = 6 \text{ steps} \]

Now that each unicorn takes 6 steps, we can calculate the total number of steps all the unicorns take combined:
\[ 6 \text{ unicorns} \times 6 = 36 \text{ steps} \]

Since each step results in 4 flowers blooming, we multiply the total number of steps by 4 to find the total number of blossoms:
\[ 36 \text{ steps} \times 4 \text{ flowers/step} = 144 \text{ flowers} \]

Therefore, 144 flowers will bloom because of the unicorns' journey.
