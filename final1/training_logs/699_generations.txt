To determine how many servings of guacamole Georgie can make, we first need to calculate the total number of avocados she will have.

Georgie starts with 5 avocados. Her sister buys another 4 avocados, so the total number of avocados is:
\[ 5 + 4 = 9 \]

The recipe requires 3 avocados to make one serving of guacamole. To find out how many servings can be made from 9 avocados, we divide the total number of avocados by the number of avocados needed per serving:
\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

Therefore, Georgie can make 3 servings of guacamole.

Georgie has 5 avocados already and her sister buys an additional 4 avocados, giving her a total of \( 5 + 4 = 9 \) avocados. To make a serving of guacamole, she requires 3 avocados. Therefore, the total number of servings she can make is \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) servings.

To determine how many servings of guacamole Georgie can make, we first need to calculate the total number of avocados she has. Initially, Georgie has 5 avocados, and then her sister buys 4 more avocados. So, the total number of avocados is \(5 + 4 = 9\). Since each serving of guacamole requires 3 avocados, we can find the number of servings by dividing the total number of avocados by 3. This means \(9 \div 3 = 3\) servings.

Georgie has already had 5 avocados initially. If her sister buys another 4 avocados, the total number of avocados Georgie will have is:

\( 5 + 4 = 9 \) avocados.

Each serving of guacamole requires 3 avocados, so the number of servings Georgie can make with 9 avocados is:

\( \frac{9 \text{ avocados}}{3 \text{ avocados/serving}} = 3 \text{ servings} \).

First, let's determine the total number of avocados Georgie has after her sister's purchase. She already has 5 avocados and her sister buys another 4 avocados. So, we add these amounts together: 5 avocados + 4 avocados = 9 avocados.

Next, we need to find out how many servings of guacamole Georgie can make. Since each recipe requires 3 avocados, we divide the total number of avocados by 3: 9 avocados รท 3 avocados per serving = 3 servings.

Therefore, Georgie can make 3 servings of guacamole.

To determine how many servings of guacamole Georgie can make, we first need to calculate the total number of avocados she has. Georgie starts with 5 avocados and her sister buys another 4 avocados. Therefore, the total number of avocados is:

Next, we need to figure out how many servings of guacamole this total number of avocados will allow. Since Georgie needs 3 avocados to make one serving of guacamole, we can find the number of servings by dividing the total number of avocados by 3:

\[9 \div 3 = 3\]

Thus, Georgie can make 3 servings of guacamole.

To determine how many servings of guacamole Georgie can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of avocados Georgie has after her sister buys 4 more.
2. Determine how many servings she can make based on the number of avocados she has, given that each serving requires 3 avocados.

First, Georgie initially had 5 avocados. Her sister purchases 4 more avocados, so we add those to the initial amount:
\[ 5 + 4 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many servings of guacamole she can make with these 9 avocados, given that each serving requires 3 avocados.

To do this, we divide the total number of avocados by the number required per serving:
\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

So, Georgie can make 3 servings of guacamole.
