system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, determine the total number of ripe mangoes on the tree. Given that 3/5 of the mangoes on the tree are ripe, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of ripe mangoes} = \frac{3}{5} \times 400 = 240
   \]

2. Next, calculate how many of these ripe mangoes Lindsay eats. Since Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes, we find:
   \[
   \text{Mangoes eaten by Lindsay} = 0.60 \times 240 = 144
   \]

3. Finally, to find the number of ripe mangoes that remain after Lindsay eats some of them, we subtract the number of mangoes Lindsay ate from the total number of ripe mangoes:
   \[
   \text{Ripe mangoes remaining} = 240 - 144 = 96
   \]

So, the number of ripe mangoes remaining after Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes is 96.

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine the number of ripe mangoes on the tree. Given that 3/5 of the mangoes on the tree are ripe, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of ripe mangoes = (3/5) * 400 = 240 mangoes

Next, we need to find out how many ripe mangoes Lindsay ate. Given that Lindsay ate 60% of the ripe mangoes, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of ripe mangoes eaten by Lindsay = 60/100 * 240 = 144 mangoes

Finally, to find out the number of ripe mangoes remaining, we subtract the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay ate from the total number of ripe mangoes:

Number of ripe mangoes remaining = 240 - 144 = 96 mangoes

To calculate the number of ripe mangoes remaining after Lindsay eats some, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of ripe mangoes initially:**
   Given that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the mangoes on the tree are ripe, we can find the number of ripe mangoes initially by:
   \[
   \text{Number of ripe mangoes initially} = \frac{3}{5} \times 400 = 240
   \]

2. **Determine the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats:**
   According to the problem, Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes. To find the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats, we calculate 60% of 240:
   \[
   \text{Number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats} = 0.60 \times 240 = 144
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ripe mangoes remaining:**
   To find the number of ripe mangoes remaining after Lindsay eats some, we subtract the number of ripe mangoes she eats from the initial number of ripe mangoes:
   \[
   \text{Number of ripe mangoes remaining} = 240 - 144 = 96
   \]

Therefore, the number of ripe mangoes remaining is 96.

To calculate the number of ripe mangoes remaining after Lindsay eats 60% of them, we'll follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of ripe mangoes on the tree.
2. Calculate how many of these ripe mangoes Lindsay eats.
3. Subtract the number of eaten ripe mangoes from the total ripe mangoes to find the remaining ripe mangoes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ripe mangoes.
Given that 3/5 of the mangoes on the tree are ripe, we can calculate the number of ripe mangoes by:
\[ \text{Ripe mangoes} = \frac{3}{5} \times 400 \]

\[ \text{Ripe mangoes} = 240 \]

Step 2: Calculate how many of these ripe mangoes Lindsay eats.
If Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes, she eats:
\[ \text{Mangoes eaten} = 0.60 \times 240 \]

\[ \text{Mangoes eaten} = 144 \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of eaten ripe mangoes from the total ripe mangoes.
\[ \text{Ripe mangoes remaining} = 240 - 144 \]

\[ \text{Ripe mangoes remaining} = 96 \]

So, after Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes, 96 ripe mangoes remain.

To determine the number of ripe mangoes remaining, we first need to calculate the total number of ripe mangoes on the tree. This can be done by finding 3/5 of the total mangoes, as given in the problem statement.

Total mangoes on the tree: 400
Ripe mangoes: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 400 = 240 \)

Next, we need to determine how many of these ripe mangoes Lindsay eats. Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes. Thus, the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats is:

Number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats: \( 0.60 \times 240 = 144 \)

Finally, we subtract the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats from the total number of ripe mangoes to find out how many ripe mangoes remain:

Ripe mangoes remaining: \( 240 - 144 = 96 \)

Therefore, the number of ripe mangoes remaining is 96.

To calculate the number of ripe mangoes remaining on the tree, we will first determine how many mangoes are ripe and then account for the number eaten by Lindsay.

1. **Calculate the number of ripe mangoes:**
   - We know that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the mangoes on the tree are ripe.
   - There are 400 mangoes on the tree.

   Therefore, the number of ripe mangoes is:
   \[
   \text{Number of ripe mangoes} = \frac{3}{5} \times 400 = 240
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ripe mangoes eaten by Lindsay:**
   - Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes.
   - Therefore, the number of ripe mangoes eaten is:
   \[
   \text{Number of ripe mangoes eaten} = 0.60 \times 240 = 144
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ripe mangoes remaining:**
   - Subtract the number of ripe mangoes eaten from the total number of ripe mangoes:
   \[
   \text{Number of ripe mangoes remaining} = 240 - 144 = 96
   \]

So, after Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes, there will be 96 ripe mangoes remaining on the tree.
