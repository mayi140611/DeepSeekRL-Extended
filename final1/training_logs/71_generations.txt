Hillary sells 3 crafts for $12 each, which totals to \(3 \times 12 = $36\). She is also given an extra $7, so before depositing the money, she has \(36 + 7 = $43\). She then deposits $18 into her bank account, so she is left with \(43 - 18 = $25\).

Answer: Hillary is left with $25 after making the deposit.

To determine how much money Hillary is left with after making her deposit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the crafts.
2. Add the extra 7 dollars received from the customer.
3. Subtract the amount deposited into the bank account from the total revenue.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the crafts.
Hillary sells each craft for $12 and she sells 3 crafts.
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/craft} \times 3 \text{ crafts} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Add the extra 7 dollars received from the customer.
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} + 7 \text{ dollars} = 43 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Subtract the amount deposited into the bank account from the total revenue.
Hillary deposits $18 into her bank account.
\[ 43 \text{ dollars} - 18 \text{ dollars} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, after making the deposit, Hillary is left with 25 dollars.

#### GENERATION 9 RESPONSE ####


system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Hillary made from selling crafts and then subtract the amount she deposited into the bank account.

First, calculate the total amount Hillary earned from selling 3 crafts:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 3 \text{ crafts} \times \$12 \text{ per craft} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 3 \times 12 = \$36 \]

Next, add the extra 7 dollars she received from the customer:

\[ \text{Total with extra} = \text{Total earnings} + \$7 \]

\[ \text{Total with extra} = \$36 + \$7 = \$43 \]

Then, subtract the amount Hillary deposited into her bank account:

\[ \text{Final amount} = \text{Total with extra} - \$18 \]

\[ \text{Final amount} = \$43 - \$18 = \$25 \]

Hillary is left with \$25 after making the deposit.
