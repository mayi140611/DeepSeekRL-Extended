system
To calculate Roberto's current salary, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the salary after the 40% raise from his starting salary.
2. Calculate the salary after a 20% raise from the increased salary.

Step 1: Calculate the salary after the 40% raise from his starting salary.
Starting salary: $80,000
40% of $80,000 = 0.40 * $80,000 = $32,000
Salary after 40% raise = Starting salary + 40% of starting salary = $80,000 + $32,000 = $112,000

Step 2: Calculate the salary after a 20% raise from the increased salary.
Salary after 40% raise: $112,000
20% of $112,000 = 0.20 * $112,000 = $22,400
Current salary = Salary after 40% raise + 20% of salary after 40% raise = $112,000 + $22,400 = $134,400

Therefore, Roberto's current salary is $134,400.

To find Roberto's current salary, we need to work step-by-step based on the information provided.

1. **Starting Salary**: Roberto's starting salary is $80,000.

2. **First Raise**: This is a 40% raise on the starting salary.
   - Raise amount = 40% of $80,000
   - Raise amount = 0.40 * $80,000 = $32,000
   - New salary after first raise = $80,000 + $32,000 = $112,000

3. **Second Raise**: This is a 20% raise on the new salary after the first raise.
   - Raise amount = 20% of $112,000
   - Raise amount = 0.20 * $112,000 = $22,400
   - Current salary = $112,000 + $22,400 = $134,400

Therefore, Roberto's current salary is $134,400.

To find Roberto's current salary, we need to calculate his previous salary and then apply the 20% raise to it. 

1. Roberto's starting salary is $80,000. This is also 40% higher than his starting salary, so we can calculate the previous salary as follows:
   \[
   \text{Previous Salary} = \frac{\text{Starting Salary}}{1 + \text{Increase Percentage}} = \frac{80,000}{1 + 0.40} = \frac{80,000}{1.40} = 57,142.86
   \]

2. Roberto received a 20% raise on this previous salary. So, we can now calculate his current salary as:
   \[
   \text{Current Salary} = \text{Previous Salary} + 0.20 \times (\text{Previous Salary}) = 57,142.86 + 0.20 \times 57,142.86 = 57,142.86 + 11,428.57 = 68,571.43
   \]

First, we need to determine Roberto's previous salary, which was 40% higher than his starting salary. Roberto's starting salary is $80,000. To find the previous salary, we calculate:

\[ \text{Previous Salary} = \text{Starting Salary} \times (1 + \text{Increase Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Previous Salary} = 80000 \times (1 + 0.40) \]
\[ \text{Previous Salary} = 80000 \times 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Previous Salary} = 112000 \]

Roberto then received a 20% raise from his previous salary of $112,000. To find his current salary, we calculate:

\[ \text{Current Salary} = \text{Previous Salary} \times (1 + \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Current Salary} = 112000 \times (1 + 0.20) \]
\[ \text{Current Salary} = 112000 \times 1.20 \]
\[ \text{Current Salary} = 134400 \]

So, Roberto's current salary is $134,400.

system
To calculate Roberto's current salary, we first need to determine his previous salary after the 40% raise, then add a 20% raise to that new salary.

1. Calculate the increased salary: 
$80,000 (starting salary) + 40% * $80,000  
= $80,000 + $32,000  
= $112,000

2. Calculate the salary after a 20% raise on the increased salary:
$112,000 + 20% * $112,000  
= $112,000 + $22,400  
= $134,400

So, Roberto's current salary is $134,400.

To calculate Roberto's current salary, we need to work backwards from his starting salary.

1. Roberto's starting salary: $80,000.
2. His previous salary, which is 40% higher than his starting salary: $80,000 * 1.40 = $112,000.
3. His 20% raise on the previous salary: $112,000 * 0.80 = $89,600.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Roberto's starting salary is given as $80,000.
2. His previous salary is 40% higher than his starting salary. To find his previous salary, we calculate 40% of $80,000 and add it to the starting salary:
   \[
   0.40 \times 80,000 = 32,000
   \]
   \[
   80,000 + 32,000 = 112,000
   \]
   So, his previous salary was $112,000.
3. Roberto then received a 20% raise from his previous salary. To find his current salary, we calculate 20% of his previous salary and add it to the previous salary:
   \[
   0.20 \times 112,000 = 22,400
   \]
   \[
   112,000 + 22,400 = 134,400
   \]
   So, Roberto's current salary is $134,400.

To calculate Roberto's current salary, we first need to calculate his previous salary, which was 40% higher than his starting salary.

Previous salary = Starting salary * 140% = $80,000 * 1.40 = $112,000.

Now, Roberto received a 20% raise on his previous salary of $112,000.

Current salary = Previous salary * 120% = $112,000 * 1.20 = $134,400.

Therefore, Roberto's current salary is $134,400.

#### GENERATION 9 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's calculate Roberto's starting salary first. The starting salary was $80,000, which was 40% higher than his starting salary. So, we can calculate the original salary before the 40% increase as follows:

Original salary = Starting salary / (1 + increase percentage)
Original salary = $80,000 / (1 + 0.40)
Original salary = $80,000 / 1.40
Original salary = $57,142.86

Now that we have the original starting salary, let's calculate the new salary after the 20% raise. 

New salary = Original salary + (Original salary * increase percentage)
New salary = $57,142.86 + ($57,142.86 * 0.20)
New salary = $57,142.86 + $11,428.57
New salary = $68,571.43

Therefore, Roberto's current salary is $68,571.43.

Roberto's initial raise from his starting salary was 40%:

\[ 40\% \times \$80,000 = 0.40 \times \$80,000 = \$32,000 \]

Subtracting this 40% raise, we get Roberto's new salary:

\[ \$80,000 - \$32,000 = \$48,000 \]

Now, he received a 20% raise on his new salary:

\[ 20\% \times \$48,000 = 0.20 \times \$48,000 = \$9,600 \]

Subtracting this 20% raise from the new salary, we get Roberto's current salary:

\[ \$48,000 - \$9,600 = \$38,400 \]

Therefore, Roberto's current salary is \$38,400.

To calculate Roberto's current salary, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the salary after a 40% raise.
2. Calculate the salary after a 20% raise from that new salary.

Starting salary: $80,000

Step 1: Calculate the salary after a 40% raise.
\[ \text{New salary} = \text{Starting salary} + (\text{Starting salary} \times 0.40) \]
\[ \text{New salary} = 80,000 + (80,000 \times 0.40) \]
\[ \text{New salary} = 80,000 + 32,000 \]
\[ \text{New salary} = 112,000 \]

Step 2: Calculate the salary after a 20% raise from the new salary.
\[ \text{Current salary} = \text{New salary} + (\text{New salary} \times 0.20) \]
\[ \text{Current salary} = 112,000 + (112,000 \times 0.20) \]
\[ \text{Current salary} = 112,000 + 22,400 \]
\[ \text{Current salary} = 134,400 \]

Therefore, Roberto's current salary is $134,400.

To determine Roberto's current salary, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Roberto's starting salary, which is already 40% higher than his starting salary.
2. Calculate his previous salary after the 20% raise.
3. Calculate his current salary.

Let's start with step 1: Roberto's starting salary, which is his current salary minus the 20% raise.

Starting salary: $80,000

Previous salary after 20% raise: $80,000 + 20% of $80,000 = $80,000 + 0.20 * $80,000 = $80,000 + $16,000 = $96,000

Now let's move to step 2: Roberto's previous salary after the 20% raise.

Previous salary after 20% raise: $96,000

Finally, let's move to step 3: Calculate Roberto's current salary.

Current salary: Previous salary after 20% raise - 20% of $96,000 = $96,000 - 0.20 * $96,000 = $96,000 - $19,200 = $76,800

Therefore, Roberto's current salary is $76,800.

To find Roberto's current salary, let's first understand how his salary has changed.

1. Roberto's starting salary was $80,000.
2. His previous salary was 40% higher than his starting salary. This means his previous salary was $80,000 * 1.40.
3. Roberto received a 20% raise from his previous salary. So, his current salary is his previous salary * (1 + 0.20).
4. Let's calculate his current salary.

First, calculate his previous salary:
\[ \text{Previous salary} = 80,000 \times 1.40 = 112,000 \]

Next, calculate his current salary:
\[ \text{Current salary} = 112,000 \times 1.20 = 134,400 \]

1. Roberto's starting salary was $80,000.
2. His previous salary was 40% higher than his starting salary. To find his previous salary, we multiply his starting salary by 140% (100% + 40%).
3. His current salary is a 20% raise from his previous salary. To find his previous salary, we multiply his previous salary by 120% (100% + 20%).
4. We first calculate his previous salary: \( 80,000 \times 1.4 = 112,000 \).
5. Next, we calculate his current salary: \( 112,000 \times 1.2 = 134,400 \).
