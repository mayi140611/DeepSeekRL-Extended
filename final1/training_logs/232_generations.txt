system
The first child was born 15 years ago, so the second child is 15 - 1 = 14 years old.
The third child is 4 years old because their birthday was on the fourth birthday of the second child.
So their fourth child is 14 + 4 + 2 = 20 years old.

The second child was born 1 year after the first and the second child is 15 years old, so the second child was born 2 years after the first.  Therefore the first child was born 15 - 2 = 13 years ago.  The third child was born on the fourth birthday of the second child, so the third child was born 4 years after the first child. Thus, the third child was born 15 - 4 = 11 years ago.  The fourth child was born two years after the third child, so the fourth child is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Jolene and Phil gave birth to their first child 15 years ago, so the first child is 15 years old.

They gave birth to their second child on the 14th birthday of their first child (15 - 1). So the second child is $15 - 1 = 14$ years old.

They gave birth to their third child on the 8th birthday of their second child (14 + 4 - 1 = 8 since 14 - 1 = 13, and 4 is their third child and 1 is their second child). Thus their third child is 8 years old.

Finally, they gave birth to their fourth child two years after their third child, so their fourth child is $8 + 2 = 10$ years old.
