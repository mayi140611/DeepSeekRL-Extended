To find the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza, we need to add these quantities together.

1. Kimber needs 10 cups of water.
2. She needs 16 cups of flour.
3. She needs 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour. 

The calculation for teaspoons of salt is:
\[ \text{Teaspoons of salt} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ teaspoons} \]

Adding up all the quantities:
\[ \text{Total} = 10 \text{ cups (water)} + 16 \text{ cups (flour)} + 8 \text{ teaspoons (salt)} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 24 \text{ cups (water, flour, and salt)} \]

Therefore, the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is 24.

To calculate the total number of cups Kimber needs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Water Calculation:**
   Kimber needs 10 cups of water.

2. **Flour Calculation:**
   Kimber needs 16 cups of flour.

3. **Salt Calculation:**
   According to the problem, Kimber needs 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour. Since she uses 16 cups of flour, we calculate the salt needed:
   \[
   \text{Salt} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]

4. **Total Calculation:**
   Now, we add the amounts of water, flour, and salt together:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Water} + \text{Flour} + \text{Salt} = 10 + 16 + 8 = 34
   \]

Therefore, the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is 34.

To calculate the total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs, we'll start with the given information:

1. Water: 10 cups
2. Flour: 16 cups
3. Salt: 1/2 times as many teaspoons as the number of cups of flour

First, we find out how many teaspoons of salt Kimber needs:

Salt (in teaspoons) = 1/2 * number of cups of flour

Let's calculate the salt for each:

Salt (for 16 cups of flour) = 1/2 * 16 = 8 teaspoons

Now, we add up all the ingredients to find the total:

Total = water + flour + salt
Total = 10 cups + 16 cups + 8 teaspoons

Since we are not asked to convert teaspoons to cups, but rather just the total quantity of all ingredients, we can simply add these amounts:

Total = 10 cups + 16 cups + 8 teaspoons

Let's do the math:

Total = 26 cups + 8 teaspoons

Now, combining all these: 

Total = 26 + 8 = 34

 Kimber needs a total of 34 cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt to make the pizza.

To calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza, we follow these steps:

1. Kimber needs 10 cups of water.
2. She needs 16 cups of flour.
3. The number of teaspoons of salt she needs is 1/2 times the number of cups of flour. Therefore, she needs 1/2 * 16 = 8 teaspoons of salt.

Now, we can calculate the total:

- Water: 10 cups
- Flour: 16 cups
- Salt: 8 teaspoons

Total = Water + Flour + Salt
Total = 10 + 16 + 8
Total = 34

Therefore, Kimber needs a combined total of 34 cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt to make the pizza.

To calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the number of teaspoons of salt needed. Since Kimber needs 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour, we can calculate this as follows:
   teaspoons of salt = (1/2) * cups of flour
   teaspoons of salt = (1/2) * 16
   teaspoons of salt = 8

2. Now, we can calculate the total combined number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt:
   total = cups of water + cups of flour + teaspoons of salt
   total = 10 + 16 + 8
   total = 34

Therefore, the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is 34.

To calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza, we will follow these steps:

1. **Cups of Water**: Given as 10 cups.
2. **Cups of Flour**: Given as 16 cups.

Next, we calculate the number of teaspoons of salt.

3. **Teaspoons of Salt**: 
   - Salt is 1/2 times the amount of flour.
   - \( \text{Teaspoons of Salt} = 1/2 \times \text{Cups of Flour} \).
   - \( \text{Teaspoons of Salt} = 1/2 \times 16 \).

Now, perform the multiplication to find the number of teaspoons of salt:

4. \( 16 \div 2 = 8 \).

Next, sum up the total:

5. \( \text{Total number of cups} = \text{Cups of Water} + \text{Cups of Flour} + \text{Teaspoons of Salt} \).
6. \( \text{Total number of cups} = 10 + 16 + 8 \).

7. \( 10 + 16 + 8 = 34 \).

So, Kimber needs a total of **34** cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt to make the pizza.

To calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza, we'll first calculate the amount of teaspoons of salt she needs:

 teaspoons of salt = 1/2 × cups of flour
 teaspoons of salt = 1/2 × 16 (since she has 16 cups of flour)
 teaspoons of salt = 8 (since 16 divided by 2 equals 8)

Now, we'll add the total cups of water and flour that she needs:

 total cups of water + total cups of flour = 10 cups + 16 cups = 26 cups

Finally, we'll add the teaspoons of salt to get the total combined number of cups:

total cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt = total cups of water + total cups of flour + teaspoons of salt
 total cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt = 26 cups + 8 teaspoons
 total cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt = 34 cups

So, Kimber needs 34 cups in total to make the pizza.
