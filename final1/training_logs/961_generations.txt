system
<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of people at Taylor's party as \( T \).

According to the problem, Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party. So, the number of people at Ryan's party can be represented as \( 4T \).

The problem states that the combined number of people at both parties is 240. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ T + 4T = 240 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5T = 240 \]

To find the number of people at Taylor's party, we divide both sides by 5:

\[ T = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

Since Ryan's party had 4 times as many people as Taylor's party, we calculate:

\[ 4T = 4 \times 48 = 192 \]

So, the number of people at Ryan's party is 192.

Let's denote the number of people at Taylor's party as \( T \).

Given that Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's, we can express the number of people at Ryan's party as \( 4T \).

The total number of people at both parties combined is 240, so we can write the equation:

\[ T + 4T = 240 \]

Simplifying the equation gives:

\[ 5T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ T = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

Then, to find the number of people at Ryan's party:

\[ 4T = 4 \times 48 = 192 \]

So, Ryan's party had 192 people.

Let's call the number of people at Taylor's party "T". According to the problem, Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party, so the number of people at Ryan's party is 4T.

The total number of people at both parties combined is 240. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

T + 4T = 240
5T = 240

Now we can solve for T:

T = 240 / 5
T = 48

So Taylor's party had 48 people. Since Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party, we can find the number of people at Ryan's party by multiplying:

Ryan's party = 4 * T
Ryan's party = 4 * 48
Ryan's party = 192

Therefore, Ryan's party had 192 people.

To solve this problem, let's denote the number of people at Taylor's party as \( T \). According to the problem, Ryan's party had 4 times as many people as Taylor's party. Therefore, the number of people at Ryan's party would be \( 4T \).

We are also given that the combined number of people at both parties is 240. So we can write the equation:

\[ T + 4T = 240 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5T = 240 \]

To find the number of people at Taylor's party (\( T \)), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ T = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

So, Taylor's party had 48 people. Since Ryan's party had 4 times as many people, we multiply the number of people at Taylor's party by 4:

\[ 4T = 4 \times 48 = 192 \]

Thus, Ryan's party had 192 people.

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand the relationship**: Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party combined.

2. **Define variables**: Let \( T \) represent the number of people at Taylor's party.

3. **Express Ryan's party in terms of \( T \)**:
   - Ryan's party size = 4 times Taylor's party size.
   - So, Ryan's party size = 4T.

4. **Combine both parties**:
   - Total number of people at both parties = Taylor's party + Ryan's party.
   - Total = \( T + 4T \).

5. **Set up the equation**:
   - According to the problem, the combined number of people is 240.
   - Therefore, \( T + 4T = 240 \).

6. **Simplify the equation**:
   - \( 5T = 240 \).

7. **Solve for \( T \)**:
   - \( T = \frac{240}{5} \)
   - \( T = 48 \).

8. **Find Ryan's party size**:
   - Ryan's party size = 4T.
   - Ryan's party size = 4 * 48 = 192.

Therefore, the number of people at Ryan's party was 192.

system
<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of people at Taylor's birthday party as \( x \). According to the information given, Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party. Therefore, the number of people at Ryan's party can be represented as \( 4x \).

The total number of people at both parties combined is given as 240. Thus, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 240 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 5x = 240 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{240}{5} \]
\[ x = 48 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of people at Taylor's party, and we have calculated that \( x = 48 \), we know that 48 people attended Taylor's party.

To find the number of people at Ryan's party, we multiply \( x \) by 4:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 48 \]
\[ 4x = 192 \]

Therefore, Ryan's party had 192 people.

Let's denote the number of people at Taylor's party as \( T \). According to the problem, the number of people at Ryan's party is 4 times the number at Taylor's party. Thus, the number of people at Ryan's party is \( 4T \).

The total number of people at both parties combined is given as 240. This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ T + 4T = 240 \]
\[ 5T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ T = \frac{240}{5} \]
\[ T = 48 \]

Since \( T \) is the number of people at Taylor's party, the number of people at Ryan's party is:

To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of people at Taylor's party as \( T \).

According to the problem:
- Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's birthday party.
- The total number of people at both parties combined is 240.

So, we can write the first equation as:
\[ R = 4T \]
where \( R \) represents the number of people at Ryan's party.

The second equation from the total number of people is:
\[ R + T = 240 \]

Now we can substitute \( R = 4T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 4T + T = 240 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ T = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

So now, we have the number of people at Taylor's party (\( T \) = 48). We can find the number of people at Ryan's party (\( R \)) by plugging \( T \) back into the first equation:

\[ R = 4 \times 48 = 192 \]

Therefore, the number of people at Ryan's party is 192.

Let's denote the number of people at Taylor's party as \( T \).

According to the problem, Ryan's party had 4 times as many people as Taylor's party. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Number of people at Ryan's party} = 4 \times T \]

The total number of people at both parties combined is given as 240. So, we can write:
\[ \text{Number of people at Ryan's party} + \text{Number of people at Taylor's party} = 240 \]

Substituting the expression for the number of people at Ryan's party, we get:
\[ 4 \times T + T = 240 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 5 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ T = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

So, Taylor's party had 48 people.

Since Ryan's party had 4 times as many people as Taylor's party:
\[ \text{Number of people at Ryan's party} = 4 \times 48 = 192 \]

Finally, let's double-check our calculations:
Taylor's party: 48 people
Ryan's party: 192 people (which is 4 times Taylor's party)

Combined total: 48 + 192 = 240 people (which equals the given total).

Therefore, Ryan's party had 192 people.
