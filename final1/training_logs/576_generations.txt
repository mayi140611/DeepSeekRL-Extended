###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

At a roller derby, 4 teams are competing. Each team is made up of 10 members, and each member needs a pair of roller skates to compete in and another pair of skates as a backup. None of the skates have laces yet, so each member is offered 3 sets of laces per pair of skates. How many sets of laces have been handed out?

system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of members competing in the roller derby. There are 4 teams, and each team has 10 members:
   \[
   4 \text{ teams} \times 10 \text{ members/team} = 40 \text{ members}
   \]

2. Each member needs 2 pairs of roller skates (one to wear and one as a backup). Therefore, each member will receive a total of:
   \[
   2 \text{ pairs} \times 3 \text{ sets of laces/pair} = 6 \text{ sets of laces per member}
   \]

3. Now, we multiply the number of sets of laces each member will receive by the total number of members:
   \[
   40 \text{ members} \times 6 \text{ sets/member} = 240 \text{ sets of laces}
   \]

So, a total of 240 sets of laces have been handed out.

system
To determine the total number of sets of laces handed out, we need to calculate the number of skates and then multiply by the number of sets of laces per pair.

1. Calculate the total number of members across all teams:
   \[
   4 \text{ teams} \times 10 \text{ members/team} = 40 \text{ members}
   \]

2. Each member needs 2 pairs of roller skates, so:
   \[
   40 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ pairs/member} = 80 \text{ skates}
   \]

3. Each pair of skates comes with 3 sets of laces, therefore:
   \[
   80 \text{ pairs} \times 3 \text{ sets/pair} = 240 \text{ sets of laces}
   \]

So, the total number of sets of laces handed out is \( 240 \).

First, let's calculate the total number of members competing in the roller derby.

There are 4 teams, and each team has 10 members:
\[ 4 \text{ teams} \times 10 \text{ members/team} = 40 \text{ members} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pairs of skates each member needs:
\[ 40 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ skates/member} = 80 \text{ skates} \]

Since each member gets 3 sets of laces for each pair of skates, we calculate the total sets of laces for each member:
\[ 3 \text{ sets of laces} \times 2 \text{ skates/member} = 6 \text{ sets of laces per member} \]

Now, let's find the total number of sets of laces handed out to all 40 members:
\[ 40 \text{ members} \times 6 \text{ sets of laces/member} = 240 \text{ sets of laces} \]

Therefore, the total number of sets of laces handed out is:

Each team member needs 2 pairs of skates, and each pair requires 3 sets of laces. Therefore, each member needs 2 pairs * 3 sets = 6 sets of laces. Since each team has 10 members, the total number of sets for one team is 10 * 6 = 60 sets of laces.

There are 4 teams, so for all teams combined, the total number of sets handed out is 4 * 60 = 240 sets of laces.

To determine the total number of sets of laces handed out, we need to calculate the number of skates and then the number of sets of laces per skate.

First, we calculate the total number of skates:
- Each team has 10 members.
- There are 4 teams.
- Each member has 2 pairs of skates (one primary and one backup).

So, the total number of skates is:
\[ 10 \text{ members/team} \times 2 \text{ pairs/member} \times 4 \text{ teams} = 80 \text{ skates} \]

Next, we calculate the number of sets of laces per skate. Each skate requires 3 sets of laces:
\[ 3 \text{ sets per skate} \]

Now, we multiply the total number of skates by the number of sets of laces per skate to find the total number of sets of laces:
\[ 80 \text{ skates} \times 3 \text{ sets per skate} = 240 \text{ sets of laces} \]

So, the total number of sets of laces handed out is:

There are 4 teams competing, and each team has 10 members. Therefore, the total number of members is \(4 \times 10 = 40\). Each member needs a pair of skates, and each pair of skates comes with 3 sets of laces. Thus, the total number of sets of laces handed out is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine the total number of sets of laces handed out, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total Members in Teams:**
   Each team has 10 members, and there are 4 teams participating.
   \[
   10 \text{ members/team} \times 4 \text{ teams} = 40 \text{ members}
   \]

2. **Skates per Member:**
   Each member needs 2 pairs of skates, and thus each member gets 2 sets of laces.

   Therefore, for 40 members:
   \[
   40 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ sets of laces/member} = 80 \text{ sets of laces}
   \]

3. **Laces per Pair of Skates:**
   Each set of laces consists of 3 sets of laces per pair of skates.

   Therefore, for 80 sets of laces:
   \[
   80 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ sets of laces/pair} = 240 \text{ sets of laces}
   \]

4. **Final Calculation:**
   Each member is offered 3 sets of laces per pair, which means for each member there are \(3 \times 2 = 6\) sets of laces per member. Given that there are 40 members:
   \[
   40 \text{ members} \times 6 \text{ sets of laces/member} = 240 \text{ sets of laces}
   \]

5. **Total Laces Provided:**
   Multiplying the number of sets per member by the total number of members gives:
   \[
   40 \text{ members} \times 6 \text{ sets of laces/member} = 240 \text{ sets of laces}
   \]

However, since laces are needed for both the primary and backup skates, each member receives 6 sets of laces (3 for primary and 3 for backup), and for 40 members:
\[
40 \times 6 = 240 \text{ sets of laces}
\]

This calculation indicates that 240 sets of laces are handed out.

Each team member requires a pair of roller skates and another pair as a backup, making it a total of 2 pairs per team member. With 10 members per team, that makes 20 pairs per team. Each pair comes with 3 sets of laces. Therefore, for one team, the total number of laces handed out is 20 pairs × 3 laces per pair = 60 sets of laces.

Since there are 4 teams, we need to multiply the laces handed out to one team by the number of teams: 60 sets per team × 4 teams = 240 sets of laces.

To calculate the total number of sets of laces handed out, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of members, considering the teams and their members and their backups:
   \[
   \text{Total members} = \text{Number of teams} \times \text{Members per team} = 4 \times 10 = 40
   \]

2. Since each member needs 2 sets of laces, we multiply the total number of members by 2:
   \[
   \text{Total laces needed} = \text{Total members} \times \text{Laces per member} = 40 \times 2 = 80
   \]

3. Since each group of 3 sets of laces is offered to a member, and there are 40 members, we divide the total number of laces needed by 3:
   \[
   \text{Total sets of laces given out} = \frac{\text{Total laces needed}}{\text{Sets of laces per group}} = \frac{80}{3}
   \]

4. To determine the total number of sets of laces given out, we take the integer part of the division:
   \[
   \text{Total sets of laces given out} = 26 \text{ (integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)}

Each member gets a pair of skates, which means they need 2 sets of laces (one for roller skates and one for the backup). Since there are 10 members in each team, that means each team needs 10 * 2 = 20 sets of laces.

There are 4 teams, so altogether, they need 4 * 20 = 80 sets of laces.

If each member gets 3 sets of laces, that means for all 10 members in the team, that's 10 * 3 = 30 sets of laces per team.

There are 4 teams, so altogether, that's 4 * 30 = 120 sets of laces for all teams combined.

Since the laces are handed out by the team to the members, there are 120 sets of laces given out in total.
