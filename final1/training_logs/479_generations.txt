To determine Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we need to calculate his monthly earnings after the salary increase and then multiply by the number of months in 3 years.

1. Calculate the new monthly salary after a 30% increase:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \text{Original Salary} + (\text{Original Salary} \times 30\%)
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 6000 + (6000 \times 0.30) = 6000 + 1800 = 7800
   \]

2. Calculate the earnings for the first year:
   \[
   \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{New Salary} \times 12 = 7800 \times 12 = 93600
   \]

3. Calculate the earnings for the next two years (3 years total):
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Annual Earnings} \times 3 = 93600 \times 3 = 280800
   \]

So, Kirt's total earnings after 3 years are:

To calculate Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we need to first calculate his increased salary after a year and then multiply that by 3 years.

Kirt's initial salary is $6000 per month. After a year, his salary increased by 30%. 
Increase in salary = Initial salary * Increase percentage
Increase in salary = $6000 * 30/100 = $1800

So his salary after a year would be:

$6000 (initial salary) + $1800 (increase) = $7800 per month

Now, if we multiply this by 12 months (1 year), we get the annual salary after the increase:

$7800 * 12 = $93600

Finally, to find his total earnings after 3 years, we'll multiply his annual salary by 3:

$93600 * 3 = $280800

Therefore, Kirt's total earnings after 3 years would be $280,800.

To calculate Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we first need to determine his salary after the 30% increase for a single year.

1. **Calculate the increase in salary:**
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 6000 \times 0.30 = 1800
   \]

2. **Calculate his new salary after the increase:**
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 6000 + 1800 = 7800
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings for one year with the increased salary:**
   \[
   \text{Total for One Year} = 7800 \times 12 = 93600
   \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings over 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total for 3 Years} = 93600 \times 3 = 280800

To calculate Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we need to calculate his earnings for each year and then sum them up.

1. Initial monthly salary: $6000
2. After 1 year, his salary increased by 30%, so the new monthly salary is:
   $6000 * (1 + 0.30) = $6000 * 1.30 = $7800

3. His yearly salary for the first year:
   $7800 * 12 = $93600

4. His yearly salary for the remaining 2 years after the salary increase:
   $6000 * 12 = $72000 (since the base salary does not change for the remaining 2 years)

5. Total earnings for 3 years:
   Year 1: $93600
   Year 2+3 (2 years): $72000
   Total: $93600 + $72000 = $165600

To calculate Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we need to first calculate his yearly increase and then multiply that by the number of years.

Kirt's yearly increase: 
0.30 * $6000 = $1800

Now, we add that amount to his original salary to get his new monthly salary:
$6000 + $1800 = $7800 per month

Since he worked 12 months in a year, we multiply that by the new monthly salary to get his yearly earnings:
$7800 * 12 = $93600 per year

Finally, we multiply that by the number of years he worked to get his total earnings:
$93600 * 3 = $280800

So, the total amount Kirt earned after 3 years is $280,800.

1. For the first year, Kirt earns $6000 per month. 
   12 months = $6000 * 12 = $72,000
2. This year's salary increase is $72,000 * 30% = $21,600, so his new monthly salary is $72,000 + $21,600 = $93,600.
3. For the second year, his earnings are $93,600 * 12 = $1,123,200
4. For the third year, his earnings are $93,600 * 12 = $1,123,200

Now, we add all the earnings to get the total earnings after 3 years.

$72,000 + $1,123,200 + $1,123,200 = $2,318,400

The increase in his salary after a year is \(30\%\) of $6000, which is \(0.30 \times 6000 = 1800\) dollars. So, his new monthly salary after a year is \(6000 + 1800 = 7800\) dollars. Since he works for 3 years, his earnings before tax would be \(7800 \times 12 \times 3 = 280800\) dollars.

To calculate Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we need to first calculate his salary after the 30% increase in the second year, then calculate his total earnings for the first year and the combined earnings for the second and third years.

After 1 year:
Salary = $6000

Salary increase in the second year = 30% of $6000 = 0.30 * $6000 = $1800
Salary after 2 years = Original salary + Salary increase
= $6000 + $1800
= $7800

Total salary after the second year = $6000 (years 1 and 2) + $7800 (year 3)
= $12000 + $7800
= $19800

Total earnings after 3 years = Total salary for years 1 and 2 + Total salary for year 3
= $12000 + $7800 + $6000
= $25800

To determine Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we need to calculate his annual salary after the 30% increase over the span of one year and then multiply that by 3.

1. Kirt's initial monthly salary is $6000.
2. After a year, his salary increased by 30%, so his new monthly salary is \(6000 + (6000 \times 0.30) = 6000 \times 1.30\).
3. Calculating the increased salary: \(6000 \times 1.30 = 7800\).
4. His annual salary after the increase is \(7800 \times 12 = 93600\).
5. To find his total earnings over 3 years, we multiply his annual salary by 3: \(93600 \times 3 = 280800\).

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Kirt's initial monthly salary is $6000.
2. After a year, his salary increases by 30%. 
   - To find the new salary after 36 months (which is one year), we calculate 30% of $6000.
   - 30% of $6000 = 0.30 * $6000 = $1800
   - The new salary after the increase is $6000 + $1800 = $7800.
3. To find the total earnings after 3 years, we multiply the new salary by the number of months in 3 years (36).
   - $7800 * 36 = $280,800.

Therefore, Kirt's total earnings after 3 years would be $280,800.

To calculate his total earnings after 3 years, we need to first calculate his earnings per month for each year and then sum them up.

1. Kirt's initial monthly salary: $6000

2. After a year of working, his salary increased by 30%. To find the new salary, we calculate 30% of his initial salary and add it to his initial salary.
\[ \text{Increase in salary} = 6000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 6000 \times 0.3 = 1800 \]
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 6000 + 1800 = 7800 \]

3. Now, we calculate his monthly earnings for the second year, which is the same as the new monthly salary calculated above.

4. For the third year, his salary was again increased by 30%. So, we again add the 30% of the new salary to the new salary itself.
\[ \text{Increase in salary} = 7800 \times \frac{30}{100} = 7800 \times 0.3 = 2340 \]
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 7800 + 2340 = 10140 \]

5. Now, we calculate his total earnings for the third year:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 10140 \times 12 \]

6. Sum up his earnings for the first year, second year, and third year.

\[ \text{Total earnings for first year} = 6000 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings for second year} = 7800 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings for third year} = 10140 \times 12 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings after 3 years} = (6000 \times 12) + (7800 \times 12) + (10140 \times 12) \]

\[ = 72000 + 93600 + 121680 \]

\[ = 387280 \]

Therefore, Kirt's total earnings after 3 years are $387280.

To determine Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we need to calculate his earnings for the first year and then apply the 30% increase for each subsequent year until the third year. After that, we sum the earnings from each year to get the total earnings.

1. Calculate Kirt's earnings in the first year:
   - Monthly salary = $6000
   - Number of months in a year = 12
   - First year's earnings = $6000 * 12 = $72,000

2. Calculate the increased monthly salary for the second year:
   - Increase percentage = 30%
   - Increased monthly salary = $6000 * (1 + 0.30) = $6000 * 1.30 = $7800

3. Calculate the first year's earnings for the second year:
   - Earnings in the first year = $72,000
   - Additional earnings in the second year = $7800 * 12 = $93,600
   - Second year's earnings = $72,000 + $93,600 = $165,600

4. Calculate the increased monthly salary for the third year:
   - Increased monthly salary = $7800

5. Calculate the first year's earnings for the third year:
   - Earnings in the first year = $72,000
   - Additional earnings in the third year = $7800 * 12 = $93,600
   - Third year's earnings = $72,000 + $93,600 = $165,600

6. Sum the total earnings:
   - Total earnings = First year's earnings + Second year's earnings + Third year's earnings
   - Total earnings = $72,000 + $165,600 + $165,600 = $403,200

Therefore, Kirt's total earnings after 3 years is $403,200.

To calculate Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we need to calculate his annual salary increase and then add it to his initial salary.

Initial annual salary: $6000 * 12 = $72,000

After a year, his salary increased by 30%, so his new annual salary would be:

New annual salary = Initial annual salary + (Initial annual salary * 30%)

New annual salary = $72,000 + ($72,000 * 0.30) = $72,000 + $21,600 = $93,600
