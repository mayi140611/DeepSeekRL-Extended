###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Carol is an aviation engineer deciding how much fuel to put in a jet. The empty plane needs 20 gallons of fuel per mile. Each person on the plane increases this amount by 3 gallons per mile, and each bag increases it by 2 gallons per mile. If there are 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, and each person brought two bags, how many gallons of fuel does the plane need for a 400-mile trip?

To determine the total amount of fuel needed, we need to calculate the incremental increase in fuel per mile caused by each factor: passengers, crew, and bags.

1. Let's start with the base fuel requirement:
   - The empty plane needs 20 gallons per mile.

2. Calculate the fuel increase due to passengers:
   - There are 30 passengers.
   - Each passenger increases the fuel requirement by 3 gallons per mile.
   - Total fuel increase from passengers: \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) gallons per mile.

3. Calculate the fuel increase due to crew:
   - There are 5 flight crew members.
   - Each crew member increases the fuel requirement by 3 gallons per mile.
   - Total fuel increase from crew: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) gallons per mile.

4. Calculate the fuel increase due to bags:
   - Each person brought 2 bags, so every person brings 2 bags.
   - There are 35 people (30 passengers + 5 crew members).
   - Each bag increases the fuel requirement by 2 gallons per mile.
   - Total fuel increase from bags: \( 35 \times 2 = 70 \) gallons per mile.

5. Sum up all the fuel increases:
   - Base fuel: 20 gallons per mile.
   - Fuel increase due to passengers: 90 gallons per mile.
   - Fuel increase due to crew: 15 gallons per mile.
   - Fuel increase due to bags: 70 gallons per mile.
   - Total fuel increase per mile: \( 20 + 90 + 15 + 70 = 195 \) gallons per mile.

6. Calculate the total fuel needed for a 400-mile trip:
   - Total fuel needed: \( 195 \times 400 = 78000 \) gallons.
   
7. Adding the initial fuel for an empty plane:
   - Total fuel: \( 20 \times 400 + 78000 = 8000 + 78000 = 86000 \) gallons.

To determine the total amount of fuel the plane needs for a 400-mile trip, we need to consider the base fuel requirements and the additional fuel contributions from passengers and bags.

1. **Base Fuel Requirement:**
   The empty plane needs 20 gallons of fuel per mile. For a 400-mile trip, the base fuel requirement for the empty plane is:
   \[
   20 \text{ gallons/mile} \times 400 \text{ miles} = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Additional Fuel from Passengers:**
   Each person brings 2 bags, and each bag increases the fuel requirement by 2 gallons per mile. There are 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, for a total of:
   \[
   30 + 5 = 35 \text{ people}
   \]
   Each of these people brings 2 bags, so the total number of bags is:
   \[
   35 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ bags/person} = 70 \text{ bags}
   \]
   Since each bag increases the fuel requirement by 2 gallons per mile, the additional fuel requirement from the bags is:
   \[
   70 \text{ bags} \times 2 \text{ gallons/bag} = 140 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Additional Fuel from Flight Crew:**
   The flight crew, including 5 flight crew members, will also contribute to the fuel requirement. The fuel requirement per person per mile is increased by 3 gallons, so the total additional fuel requirement per person per 400 miles is:
   \[
   3 \text{ gallons/mile} \times 400 \text{ miles} = 1200 \text{ gallons/person}
   \]
   For 35 people, the total additional fuel requirement is:
   \[
   35 \text{ people} \times 1200 \text{ gallons/person} = 42000 \text{ gallons}
   \]
   This is significantly more than the initial 20 gallons per mile requirement for each plane mile.

4. **Total Fuel Requirement:**
   Adding the base fuel requirement to the additional fuel from passengers and flight crew, we get the total fuel required for the 400-mile trip:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 140 \text{ gallons} + 42000 \text{ gallons} = 43840 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of fuel the plane needs for the 400-mile trip is 43840 gallons.

To determine the total fuel required for the trip, we need to calculate how much additional fuel is needed for the passengers, the flight crew, and the bags.

First, calculate the total number of people on the plane:
30 passengers + 5 flight crew = 35 people in total.

Next, calculate the additional fuel needed for these people:
35 people * 3 gallons per mile = 105 gallons for the passengers.

Then, calculate the additional fuel needed for the bags:
35 people * 2 bags per person * 2 gallons per bag = 140 gallons for the bags.

Now, calculate the total fuel needed for the passengers:
105 gallons + 50 gallons = 155 gallons for the passengers.

Finally, add the fuel needed for the bags:
155 gallons + 70 gallons = 225 gallons for the bags.

Adding these together gives the total fuel needed for the trip:
225 gallons for the passengers + 220 gallons for the bags = 445 gallons total fuel required.

To calculate the total amount of fuel required for the trip, let's break down the fuel consumption based on the given factors.

1. **Empty Plane's Fuel Demand**: The empty plane needs 20 gallons per mile.
2. **Fuel Demand per Person**: Each person increases the fuel consumption by 3 gallons per mile.
3. **Fuel Demand per Bag**: Each bag increases the fuel consumption by 2 gallons per mile.
4. **Passengers and Flight Crew**: There are 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, which totals 35 people.
5. **Baggage per Person**: Each person brought two bags, totaling \(35 \times 2 = 70\) bags.

Let's calculate the fuel demand per mile for the passengers and the bags, then add in the demand for the empty plane.

- **Passengers' Contribution**:
  \[
  35 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ gallons/mile/person} = 105 \text{ gallons/mile}
  \]
- **Bags' Contribution**:
  \[
  70 \text{ bags} \times 2 \text{ gallons/mile/bag} = 140 \text{ gallons/mile}
  \]

Now, add these contributions and the empty planeâ€™s demand:
\[
\text{Total fuel per mile} = 105 \text{ gallons/mile (passengers)} + 140 \text{ gallons/mile (bags)} + 20 \text{ gallons/mile (empty plane)} = 265 \text{ gallons/mile}
\]

Finally, multiply the total fuel per mile by the number of miles for the 400-mile trip:
\[
\text{Total fuel for 400 miles} = 265 \text{ gallons/mile} \times 400 \text{ miles} = 106,000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Therefore, the plane needs \(106,000\) gallons of fuel for a 400-mile trip.

2. **Fuel required due to passengers**: Each person increases the fuel requirement by 3 gallons per mile. There are 30 passengers, so the additional fuel required due to passengers is:
   \[ 3 \text{ gallons/mile/passenger} \times 30 \text{ passengers} = 90 \text{ gallons/mile} \]
   For a 400-mile trip, the additional fuel required due to passengers is:
   \[ 90 \text{ gallons/mile} \times 400 \text{ miles} = 36000 \text{ gallons} \]

3. **Fuel required due to bags**: Each person brings two bags, and each bag increases the fuel requirement by 2 gallons per mile. There are 30 passengers, so the total number of bags is:
   \[ 30 \text{ passengers} \times 2 \text{ bags/passenger} = 60 \text{ bags} \]
   The additional fuel required due to the bags is:
   \[ 2 \text{ gallons/mile/bag} \times 60 \text{ bags} = 120 \text{ gallons/mile} \]
   For a 400-mile trip, the additional fuel required due to the bags is:
   \[ 120 \text{ gallons/mile} \times 400 \text{ miles} = 48000 \text{ gallons} \]

4. **Total fuel required**: Adding the base fuel, additional fuel due to passengers, and additional fuel due to bags:
   \[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 36000 \text{ gallons} + 48000 \text{ gallons} = 92000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the plane needs a total of 92000 gallons of fuel for a 400-mile trip.

First, let's calculate the number of people on the plane. There are 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, which totals 35 people. Each person brings two bags, so the total number of bags is \(35 \times 2 = 70\) bags. 

Next, we calculate the increase in fuel consumption due to the passengers and bags. Each person increases the fuel consumption by 3 gallons per mile, and with 35 people, that's \(35 \times 3 = 105\) gallons per mile. Each bag increases fuel consumption by 2 gallons per mile, and with 70 bags, that's \(70 \times 2 = 140\) gallons per mile. 

So, the total increase in fuel consumption per mile is the sum of the passengers' and bags' contributions: \(105 + 140 = 245\) gallons per mile.

Now, we need to calculate the total fuel consumption for a 400-mile trip. This amounts to \(245 \times 400 = 98,000\) gallons of fuel.

Finally, we add this to the initial requirement of 20 gallons per mile for the empty plane to find the total fuel needed: \(98,000 + 20 = 98,020\) gallons of fuel.

First, we calculate the effect of the passengers on the fuel consumption rate. Each person increases the fuel consumption rate by 3 gallons per mile, so with 30 passengers, the total additional fuel consumption is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) gallons per mile.

Next, consider the effect of the bags. Each person brought two bags, which means each bag increases the fuel consumption rate by 2 gallons per mile. Therefore, with 50 bags (30 passengers \(\times\) 2 bags per person), the total additional fuel consumption is \(50 \times 2 = 100\) gallons per mile.

The fuel consumption rate without any passengers or bags is 20 gallons per mile. Adding the effects of the individuals and the bags, the total fuel consumption rate becomes \(20 + 90 + 100 = 210\) gallons per mile.

First, we need to calculate the additional fuel needed per mile due to passengers and bags. Each passenger brings two bags, so each passenger and each bag increase the fuel consumption by 3 gallons per mile. With 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, there are a total of 35 people.

2. Each person increases the fuel consumption per mile by 3 gallons. Given 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, which totals 35 people, we calculate:
   - Fuel consumption per mile per person: \( 3 \text{ gallons/mile} \)
   - Total fuel consumption for 35 people: \( 35 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ gallons/mile/ person} = 105 \text{ gallons/mile} \)

To determine the total amount of fuel needed for the trip, we need to calculate the fuel usage per mile and then multiply by the number of miles.

First, let's calculate the fuel usage per mile without any passengers or bags:
- Fuel per mile = 20 gallons

Next, we account for the additional fuel usage due to passengers:
- There are 30 passengers.
- Each passenger increases the fuel usage by 3 gallons per mile.
- Therefore, the additional fuel due to passengers = 30 passengers * 3 gallons/mile = 90 gallons per mile.

Then, we account for the additional fuel usage due to bags:
- Each person brings one bag, and 2 bags per person.
- Each bag increases the fuel usage by 2 gallons per mile.
- Therefore, the additional fuel due to bags per person = 2 gallons/mile.
- The total additional fuel due to bags per person = 1 bag * 2 gallons/mile + 1 bag * 2 gallons/mile = 4 gallons per mile.
- Total additional fuel due to bags for 30 passengers = 30 passengers * 4 gallons/mile = 120 gallons per mile.

Combining all these, the total fuel usage per mile:
\[ 20 \text{ gallons} + 90 \text{ gallons} + 120 \text{ gallons} = 230 \text{ gallons per mile} \]

Now, we need to adjust for the 5 flight crew:
\[ 230 \text{ gallons per mile} + (5 \text{ crew} \times 2 \text{ bags per crew} \times 2 \text{ gallons per bag}) = 230 \text{ gallons per mile} + (5 \times 4) = 230 \text{ gallons per mile} + 20 \text{ gallons} = 250 \text{ gallons per mile} \]

Finally, we multiply the fuel usage per mile by the distance of the trip:
\[ 250 \text{ gallons per mile} \times 400 \text{ miles} = 100,000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the plane needs 100,000 gallons of fuel for a 400-mile trip.
