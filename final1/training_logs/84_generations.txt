###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

system
To determine the number of different rooms Hans could be checked into, we need to consider the layout of the hotel and the unavailable floor.

1. **Identify the total number of floors and rooms per floor:**
   - The hotel has \( 10 \) floors.
   - Each floor has \( 10 \) identical rooms.
   - The last floor is unavailable for guests.

2. **Calculate the number of rooms available:**
   - The first \( 9 \) floors have \( 10 \) rooms each.
   - Therefore, the total number of rooms on the available floors is \( 9 \) floors times \( 10 \) rooms per floor.
   - For these \( 9 \) floors, the total number of rooms is \( 9 \times 10 = 90 \) rooms.

3. **Consider the rooms on the unavailable floor:**
   - There are no other guests, so all the rooms on the unavailable floor are available for Hans to check into.

4. **Calculate the total number of different rooms Hans could be checked into:**
   - Add the number of rooms on the available floors to the number of rooms on the unavailable floor.
   - This gives \( 90 \) rooms on the available floors and \( 10 \) rooms on the unavailable floor.
   - Therefore, the total number of different rooms is \( 90 + 10 = 100 \).

Thus, Hans could be checked into any of the \( 100 \) different rooms available in the hotel.

The hotel has 10 floors, each with 10 rooms, so there are a total of 10 * 10 = 100 rooms in the hotel. Since the last floor is unavailable, Hans cannot be checked into the last floor. Therefore, he has 100 - 10 = 90 different rooms available for check-in.

Total number of floors = 10
Number of floors available for guests = 10 - 1 = 9

Total number of rooms per floor = 10
Total number of rooms Hans could be checked in = 9 rooms per floor * 10 floors = 90

To determine how many different rooms Hans could be checked into, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Hotel Layout**: The hotel has 10 floors, and each floor has 10 rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of rooms in the hotel is:
     \[
     10 \text{ floors} \times 10 \text{ rooms per floor} = 100 \text{ rooms}
     \]

2. **Identifying the Unavailable Floor**: The last floor (10th floor) is unavailable for guests.
   - This means there are no rooms on the 10th floor available for checking in.

3. **Calculating Available Rooms**: Since the 10th floor is not available, we only consider the first 9 floors.
   - Each of these 9 floors contains 10 rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of rooms available for Hans to check in is:
     \[
     9 \text{ floors} \times 10 \text{ rooms per floor} = 90 \text{ rooms}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**: Hans could be checked into any of the 90 rooms on the first 9 floors.

\[
\boxed{90}
\]

The hotel has a total of 10 floors * 10 rooms/floor = 100 rooms.

Since the last floor is not available, Hans could be checked into one of the first 9 floors * 10 rooms/floor = 90 rooms.

Therefore, the answer is 90 different rooms.

The hotel has a total of 10 floors with 10 rooms on each floor, except for the last floor which is unavailable. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of rooms on the last floor from the total number of rooms. 

The total number of rooms is calculated as: 
\[ \text{Total rooms} = \text{Floors} \times \text{Rooms per floor} \]

Given that each floor has 10 rooms and there are 9 floors available: 
\[ \text{Total rooms} = 9 \times 10 \]

The last floor therefore has:
\[ \text{Rooms on last floor} = 10 \]

The number of rooms Hans can be checked into is then:
\[ \text{Possible rooms} = \text{Total rooms} - \text{Rooms on last floor} \]
\[ \text{Possible rooms} = (9 \times 10) - 10 \]
\[ \text{Possible rooms} = 90 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Possible rooms} = 80 \]

So, Hans could be checked into 80 different rooms.

There are 10 rooms per floor and 9 floors in total, which means there are 9 floors used and there is also one empty floor which can be checked by Hans. Considering it is a big hotel with many floors, Hans can be check into any room in any floor and he can be check into any floor. So, the answer is 90 rooms because there are 9 available floors and each floor has 10 rooms, 9 x 10 = 90.

To find the number of different rooms Hans could be checked into, we need to consider the total number of rooms available.

Since the hotel has 10 floors with 10 rooms each, the total number of rooms is:
\[ 10 \text{ floors} \times 10 \text{ rooms per floor} = 100 \text{ rooms} \]

However, the last floor is unavailable. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of rooms on the available floor from the total number of rooms:
\[ 100 \text{ rooms} - 10 \text{ rooms} = 90 \text{ rooms} \]

Thus, Hans could be check into any of the 90 different rooms.

To determine the number of different rooms Hans could be checked into, we first establish the total number of rooms available in the hotel. The hotel consists of 10 floors with 10 rooms on each floor. Since the last floor is unavailable, we need to calculate the number of rooms available on the remaining floors.

The total number of rooms on the available floors is calculated as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ floors} \times 10 \text{ rooms per floor} = 100 \text{ rooms} \]

Since Hans booked a room and there are 100 rooms available on the remaining floors, the number of different rooms Hans could be checked into is:
