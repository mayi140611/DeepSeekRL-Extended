To determine how many stickers Paige will have left after sharing them equally with her friends, we need to first find out the total number of stickers Paige has. 

Paige has two sheets of stickers:
- A sheet of 100 space stickers
- A sheet of 50 cat stickers

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we need to share the 150 stickers equally among her 3 friends. To find out how many stickers each friend gets, we divide the total number of stickers by 3:
\[ 150 \div 3 = 50 \]

Since each friend gets 50 stickers, Paige will have \( 150 - (3 \times 50) \) stickers left:
\[ 150 - 150 = 0 \]

Therefore, Paige will have 0 stickers left.

Next, we need to figure out how many stickers each of her 3 friends will get. Since the stickers are shared equally among 3 friends:

\[ \frac{150}{3} = 50 \]

So, each friend receives 50 stickers. Since Paige is sharing with 3 friends, the total number of stickers distributed is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Since Paige started with 150 stickers and distributed them all, she has:

\[ 150 - 150 = 0 \]

So, she will have 0 stickers left.

To determine how many stickers Paige will have left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stickers Paige has.
2. Determine the number of stickers each friend will receive.
3. Calculate the total number of stickers given to her friends.
4. Subtract the total number of stickers given to her friends from the total number of stickers Paige originally had.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of stickers Paige has.
Paige has a sheet of 100 space stickers and a sheet of 50 cat stickers.
Total stickers = 100 + 50 = 150 stickers

Step 2: Determine the number of stickers each friend will receive.
Paige wants to share the stickers equally among her 3 friends.
Stickers per friend = 150 ÷ 3 = 50 stickers

Step 3: Calculate the total number of stickers given to her friends.
Since she has 3 friends, the total number of stickers given to her friends is:
Total stickers given = 50 * 3 = 150 stickers

Step 4: Subtract the total number of stickers given to her friends from the total number of stickers Paige originally had.
Stickers left = 150 - 150 = 0 stickers

Therefore, Paige will have 0 stickers left.

First, we need to determine the total number of space stickers and cat stickers Paige has. She has 2 sheets of stickers: one sheet with 100 space stickers and another sheet with 50 cat stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers is 100 + 50 = 150.

Next, we need to figure out how many stickers each of her 3 friends will get if the stickers are shared equally. Since she has 150 stickers in total, dividing 150 by 3, each friend will receive 150 / 3 = 50 stickers.

Now, each of her 3 friends receives 50 stickers. So, the total number of stickers given to her friends is 3 * 50 = 150.

Finally, to find out how many stickers Paige has left, we subtract the total number of stickers given to her friends from her initial total. So, Paige will have 150 - 150 = 0 stickers left.

Therefore, Paige will have 0 stickers left.

- She has 100 space stickers.
- She has 50 cat stickers.
- Therefore, the total number of stickers is \( 100 + 50 = 150 \).

Next, we need to calculate how many stickers each of her 3 friends will receive. Since she shared them equally, each friend will get \( \frac{150}{3} = 50 \) stickers.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of stickers Paige's friends received:
- Each friend got 50 stickers, and there are 3 friends, so \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \).

Since Paige gave out all 150 stickers, there are no stickers left for her.

First, we need to calculate how many stickers Paige will give to each friend. Since she has 60 space stickers and 50 cat stickers, and she is sharing them equally among 3 friends, each friend will get:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ space stickers}}{3 \text{ friends}} = 20 \text{ space stickers per friend} \]
\[ \frac{50 \text{ cat stickers}}{3 \text{ friends}} = 16 \text{ cat stickers per friend and 2 cat stickers left over} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of stickers given to her friends:

\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 20 \text{ space stickers} = 60 \text{ space stickers} \]
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 17 \text{ cat stickers} = 51 \text{ cat stickers} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stickers given away:

\[ 60 \text{ space stickers} + 51 \text{ cat stickers} = 111 \text{ stickers} \]

Paige started with 100 space stickers and 50 cat stickers, so she originally had:

\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \text{ stickers} \]

Now, to find out how many stickers will be left:

\[ 150 \text{ stickers} - 111 \text{ stickers} = 39 \text{ stickers} \]

So, Paige will have 39 stickers left.

Paige bought a total of 100 space stickers + 50 cat stickers = 150 stickers.

She wants to share these stickers equally among her 3 friends. So, each friend would get 150 stickers / 3 friends = 50 stickers.

Therefore, each friend gets 50 stickers. Since she shared all the stickers, there are no stickers left.

However, we need to find out how many stickers Paige has left. Since she bought a total of 150 stickers and each of her 3 friends received 50 stickers, Paige also received 3 × 50 stickers = 150 stickers.

Therefore, Paige has 150 stickers (bought) - 150 stickers (shared) = 0 stickers left.

So, Paige has no stickers left.

First, you need to calculate the total number of stickers Paige has. She has one sheet of 100 space stickers and another sheet of 50 cat stickers. Adding these together gives 150 stickers in total. Next, you need to divide these 150 stickers equally among her 3 friends. Each friend will receive 150/3 = 50 stickers. To find out how many stickers Paige has left, subtract the total number of stickers given to her friends from the total number of stickers she started with. So, Paige will have 150 - 50 * 3 stickers left.

Paige has a total of 100 space stickers and 50 cat stickers. To find out how many stickers she has in total, we add these two amounts together: 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

Since she wants to share these stickers equally among her 3 friends, we can divide the total number of stickers by 3: 150 ÷ 3 = 50 stickers per friend.

This means that each of her 3 friends will receive 50 stickers, but we must remember that Paige is also sharing. So we subtract the total number of stickers given to her friends from the total amount of stickers she initially had: 150 - (50 * 3) = 150 - 150 = 0 stickers.

Therefore, Piper will have 0 stickers left.

Paige has two types of stickers: space stickers and cat stickers. Each type is shared equally among her 3 friends. We need to determine how many of each type of sticker she will have left after the sharing.

1. First, calculate the number of space stickers left:
   - Paige has 100 space stickers.
   - She shares them equally among 3 friends.
   - Each friend gets \( \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \).
   - The whole number part is 33, so each friend gets 33 space stickers.
   - The remainder will be left, which is \( 100 - 33 \times 3 = 100 - 99 = 1 \).

2. Second, calculate the number of cat stickers left:
   - Paige has 50 cat stickers.
   - She shares them equally among 3 friends.
   - Each friend gets \( \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67 \).
   - The whole number part is 16, so each friend gets 16 cat stickers.
   - The remainder will be left, which is \( 50 - 16 \times 3 = 50 - 48 = 2 \).

So, Paige will have 1 space sticker and 2 cat stickers left.

Paige has two sheets of stickers. One sheet contains 100 space stickers and the other sheet contains 50 cat stickers. She wants to share these equally among her 3 friends.

First, let's calculate the total number of stickers she has:
\[ 100 \text{ (space stickers)} + 50 \text{ (cat stickers)} = 150 \text{ stickers} \]

Next, we need to determine how many stickers each friend will get. Since there are 3 friends:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ stickers}}{3} = 50 \text{ stickers per friend} \]

Since each friend gets 50 stickers, and the stickers are shared among 3 friends, Paige will need to make 3 sets of 50 stickers each. Let's calculate the total number of stickers she will give away:
\[ 3 \text{ sets} \times 50 \text{ stickers per set} = 150 \text{ stickers} \]

Now, we can find out how many stickers Paige has left by subtracting the total number of stickers given away from the total number of stickers she originally had:
\[ 150 \text{ stickers} - 150 \text{ stickers} = 0 \text{ stickers} \]

Therefore, Paige will have 0 stickers left.

Paige has a total of 100 space stickers and 50 cat stickers, making 150 stickers in total. She wants to share them equally among her 3 friends, so first she needs to divide the stickers by 3. 

\( \frac{150}{3} = 50 \)

This means each friend will get 50 stickers. Since Paige is sharing them equally, she will give 50 stickers to each of her 3 friends. Therefore, she will have given away \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \) stickers to her friends. 

Since she originally had 150 stickers and gave away all 150, she will have \( 150 - 150 = 0 \) stickers left.

Paige bought one sheet of 100 space stickers and one sheet of 50 cat stickers, which totals to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

She wants to share these stickers equally among her 3 friends. First, she divides the space stickers by 3: 100 ÷ 3 = 33 remainder 1, meaning each friend will get 33 space stickers, and there will be 1 space sticker left.

Next, she divides the cat stickers by 3: 50 ÷ 3 = 16 remainder 2, meaning each friend will get 16 cat stickers, and there will be 2 cat stickers left.

So, she will have a total of 1 + 2 = 3 stickers left after sharing.

Paige bought a total of 100 space stickers and 50 cat stickers, which sums up to 150 stickers. She wants to share these stickers equally among her 3 friends.

First, let's calculate how many stickers each friend would get if she shared all the stickers equally:
\[ \text{Total stickers} = 150 \]
\[ \text{Number of friends} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Stickers per friend} = \frac{150}{3} = 50 \]

So, each friend would get 50 stickers. Since Paige is sharing the stickers equally among her 3 friends, we need to find out how many stickers Paige would give away in total:
\[ \text{Total stickers given away} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Paige started with 150 stickers, and she gave away all 150 stickers to her friends. Therefore, she will have:
\[ \text{Leftover stickers} = 150 - 150 = 0 \]

So, Paige will have no stickers left.
