system
The car uses 20 gallons to travel 400 miles, so the rate is 20/400 = 1/20 gallons per mile. To travel 600 miles, Mr. Montero's car would need 600 * 1/20 = 30 gallons. He already has 8 gallons in his car, so he needs 30 - 8 = 22 more gallons.

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####

system
The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles, so it uses 400/20 = 20 gallons of gas per mile.

Mr. Montero's car has 8 gallons in it, so it can travel 8/20 = 0.4 miles before running out of gas.

To travel 600 miles, back and forth, he needs 600/2 = 300 miles of travel.

At a rate of 0.4 miles per gallon, he needs 300/0.4 = 750 gallons of gas.

He currently has 8 gallons, so he needs 750 - 8 = 742 more gallons of gas.

First, let's calculate the gas consumption rate of Mr. Montero's car. He has 8 gallons and needs 20 gallons to travel 400 miles. Therefore, his car consumes \( \frac{20}{400} = \frac{1}{20} \) gallons per mile. 

For a round trip of 600 miles, he would need \( 600 \times \frac{1}{20} = 30 \) gallons of gas. 

He already has 8 gallons, so he needs \( 30 - 8 = 22 \) more gallons of gas.

Mr. Montero's car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles, so it uses 20/400 = 1/20 gallons of gas per mile.
To travel 600 miles back and forth, he needs 600 * (1/20) = 30 gallons of gas.
His car has 8 gallons in it, so he needs an additional 30 - 8 = 22 gallons of gas.

system
Mr. Montero's car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles, which means it uses \( \frac{20}{400} = 0.05 \) gallons per mile.

To travel 600 miles, back and forth, he needs \( 600 \times 2 = 1200 \) miles.

So, the number of gallons needed to travel 1200 miles is \( 1200 \times 0.05 = 60 \) gallons.

Since he already has 8 gallons in his car, he needs \( 60 - 8 = 52 \) more gallons of gas to travel 600 miles, back and forth.

Mr. Montero's car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles, so this means it uses \( \frac{20 \text{ gallons}}{400 \text{ miles}} = 0.05 \text{ gallons per mile} \).

If he wants to travel 600 miles (both ways), he needs \( 600 \text{ miles} \times 0.05 \text{ gallons per mile} = 30 \text{ gallons} \).

Currently, Mr. Montero's car has 8 gallons, so he needs \( 30 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = 22 \text{ gallons} \) more.

Mr. Montero's car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles, which means it uses \(20 \, \text{gallons} / 400 \, \text{miles} = 0.05 \, \text{gallons per mile}\).

With 8 gallons, he can travel \(8 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.05 \, \text{miles per gallon} = 0.4 \, \text{miles}\).

To travel 600 miles back and forth, he needs \(600 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 1200 \, \text{miles}\).

So, he needs \(1200 \, \text{miles} \div 0.05 \, \text{miles per gallon} = 24,000 \, \text{gallons}\).

He currently has 8 gallons, so he needs an additional \(24,000 \, \text{gallons} - 8 \, \text{gallons} = 23,992 \, \text{gallons}\).

Mr. Montero needs to travel a total of 1200 miles (600 miles back and forth) and he already has 8 gallons in his car.

First, calculate the total amount of gas needed for the trip:
- Gas needed for 1200 miles is \( \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 3 \text{ gallons} \).

Next, compare the current amount of gas to the required amount:
- Mr. Montero needs \( 3 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = -5 \text{ gallons} \).

Since he already has more gas than needed, he doesn't need any additional gas to complete his trip.

system
To determine how many more gallons of gas Mr. Montero's car needs, we first need to calculate the car's fuel efficiency and then find out how many gallons would be needed for the round trip.

1. **Calculate the fuel efficiency:** The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. Therefore, the fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon) is:
   \[
   \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ gallons}} = 20 \text{ miles per gallon}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of gallons needed for a 600-mile round trip:** Since the fuel efficiency is 20 miles per gallon, the number of gallons needed for 600 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Gallons Needed} = \frac{600 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 30 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of gallons Mr. Montero's car currently has:** Mr. Montero's car has 8 gallons in it.

4. **Determine how many more gallons Mr. Montero needs:** To find out how many more gallons are needed, we subtract the current amount of gas from the amount needed for the round trip:
   \[
   \text{Gallons Needed (Additional)} = 30 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = 22 \text{ gallons}
   \]

**Conclusion:** Mr. Montero needs 22 more gallons of gas to travel 600 miles, back and forth.

The car consumes gas at a rate of 20 gallons per 400 miles, which simplifies to 0.5 gallons per mile. For 600 miles (back and forth), he needs 300 miles in total (since he's traveling back and forth). At a rate of 0.5 gallons/mile, he needs 150 gallons for the round trip. Since he has 8 gallons in the car, he needs an additional 142 gallons to cover the 600 miles (150 gallons - 8 gallons = 142 gallons).

To determine how many more gallons of gas Mr. Montero's car needs, we first need to calculate the car's fuel efficiency and then how much gas he will use for the round trip.

1. **Calculate the car's fuel efficiency:**
   The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. Therefore, the car's fuel efficiency is:
   \[
   \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ gallons}} = 20 \text{ miles per gallon}
   \]

2. **Determine the total distance for the round trip:**
   Mr. Montero needs to travel back and forth, so the total distance is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 600 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 1200 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of gas needed for the round trip:**
   Using the car's fuel efficiency, the amount of gas needed for 1200 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Gas needed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 60 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Determine the additional amount of gas needed:**
   The car already has 8 gallons of gas. Therefore, the additional amount of gas needed is:
   \[
   \text{Additional gas needed} = 60 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = 52 \text{ gallons}
   \]

**Answer:** Mr. Montero needs 52 more gallons of gas to travel 600 miles, back and forth.

Mr. Montero needs to travel 1200 miles, since 600 miles back and forth is twice 600 miles.

The car needs 25 gallons of gas to travel that distance, since 1200 miles divided by 400 miles per gallon equals 3 gallons per 100 miles.

Mr. Montero needs 17 gallons of gas to travel that distance, since the car needs 25 gallons to travel 1200 miles but only has 8 gallons.

Mr. Montero needs 9 more gallons of gas.

To travel 600 miles in round trip, first calculate the total miles: 600 miles * 2 = 1200 miles.

Now, since the car uses 20 gallons of gas for 400 miles, to find the number of gallons per mile, divide 20 gallons / 400 miles = 0.5 gallons per mile.

To find the number of gallons needed for 1200 miles, multiply the number of miles by the gallons per mile: 1200 miles * 0.5 gallons/mile = 600 gallons.

Mr. Montero's car has 8 gallons in it, so to find out how many gallons he needs to travel 600 miles back and forth, subtract the current gas in the car from the number of gallons needed: 600 gallons - 8 gallons = 592 gallons.
