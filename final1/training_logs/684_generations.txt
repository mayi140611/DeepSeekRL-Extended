Trent caught 180 tadpoles then let 75% of them go. How many did he keep?

#### ANS ####

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To find out how many tadpoles Trent kept, we first need to calculate how many tadpoles he let go.

Trent let go of 75% of the 180 tadpoles. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ 75\% \times 180 = 0.75 \times 180 = 135 \]

So, Trent let 135 tadpoles go.

To find out how many he kept, we subtract the number he let go from the original number:

\[ 180 - 135 = 45 \]

Therefore, Trent kept 45 tadpoles.

To find out how many tadpoles Trent kept, we need to calculate 75% of 180. This can be done using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of tadpoles kept} = \text{Total number of tadpoles} \times \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \]

Given that the total number of tadpoles is 180 and the percentage kept is 75%, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Number of tadpoles kept} = 180 \times \frac{75}{100} \]

\[ \text{Number of tadpoles kept} = 180 \times 0.75 \]

\[ \text{Number of tadpoles kept} = 135 \]

So, Trent kept 135 tadpoles.

First, we need to determine how many tadpoles Trent let go. Since he let go 75% of the tadpoles, we can calculate this by finding 75% of 180. The number of tadpoles he let go is \(0.75 \times 180\).

Let's calculate the number of tadpoles he let go.

Trent caught 180 tadpoles but let 75% of them go. To find out how many he let go, we calculate 75% of 180. This can be done using the formula: \(180 \times (75/100)\).

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ 180 \times 0.75 = 135 \]

This means Trent let 135 tadpoles go. To find out how many he kept, we subtract the number of tadpoles he let go from the total number he caught:
\[ 180 - 135 = 45 \]

Therefore, Trent kept 45 tadpoles.

To find out how many tadpoles Trent kept, we need to calculate the number of tadpoles he let go and subtract that from the total he caught.

First, we calculate 75% of the 180 tadpoles that Trent caught. 

\[0.75 \times 180 = 135\]

So, Trent let go 135 tadpoles.

Next, we subtract the number of tadpoles let go from the total number of tadpoles.

\[180 - 135 = 45\]

Therefore, Trent kept 45 tadpoles.

To determine how many tadpoles Trent kept, we first need to calculate how many tadpoles he released. He released 75% of the 180 tadpoles. We can find this number by calculating 75% of 180:

\[ 180 \times 0.75 = 135 \]

So, Trent released 135 tadpoles. To find out how many he kept, we subtract the number he released from the total number he caught:

\[ 180 - 135 = 45 \]

Therefore, Trent kept 45 tadpoles.

Trent initially caught 180 tadpoles. To find out how many he kept, we need to calculate 75% of 180. This means he released 75% of them and kept the remaining 25%. The calculation is as follows:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 180 = \frac{75}{100} \times 180 \]

\[ = 0.75 \times 180 \]

\[ = 135 \]

This shows that Trent released 135 tadpoles. To find out how many he kept, we subtract the released tadpoles from the total caught:

\[ \text{Total kept} = 180 - 135 \]

\[ = 45 \]

So, Trent kept 45 tadpoles.
