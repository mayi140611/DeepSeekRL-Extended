system
To find out how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, we can start by calculating their current ages and then subtract their ages from their 2nd anniversary.

The 4th anniversary will be in 6 months from now:

- 4 years later = 4 * 12 = 48 months
- Add 6 months together = 48 + 6 = 54 months
- Since it's in 6 months, subtract 6 months:
  54 - 6 = 48 months.

Now, we subtract the 2nd anniversary from the current age:

- Current age = 48 months
- 2nd anniversary = 48 months / 2 = 24 months

Finally, we subtract the 2nd anniversary age from the current age to get the 6 months ago.

- 48 months - 24 months = 24 months.

So, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 24 months ago.

If Bella and Bob will be celebrating their 4th anniversary in 6 months, then they are currently 4 - 6 = -2 months away from their 4th anniversary.
In order to find the 2nd anniversary, we need to go back 2 more intervals of 6 months, totaling 2 * 6 = 12 months.
Therefore, they celebrated their 2nd anniversary 12 months ago.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####

system
Initially, Bella and Bob will be celebrating their 4th anniversary in 6 months. 

The time that has passed since they got married can be calculated by subtracting 6 months from their 4th anniversary. 

4 years * 12 months/year = 48 months
48 months - 6 months = 42 months so far.

Therefore, they celebrated their 2nd anniversary 42 months ago.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the current anniversary as 6 months from now. Bella and Bob's 4th anniversary means they celebrated their 4th anniversary 6 months from now.

To find out how many months ago the 2nd anniversary took place, we first need to calculate the total time from the 4th anniversary to the 2nd anniversary. This time is twice the difference between the 2nd and 4th years.

The difference between 4th and 2nd years is:
\[ 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ years} \]

Since the current anniversary is 6 months from now, we need to calculate 2 years minus the current months to find out how many months ago the 2nd anniversary happened.

First, convert 2 years to months:
\[ 2 \text{ years} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Now, subtract the current months from the 24 months:
\[ 24 - 6 = 18 \text{ months} \]

So, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 18 months ago.
