#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine Patrick's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Robert's current age before the given future date.
2. Calculate Patrick's age based on the age difference between him and Robert.

Robert will turn 30 after 2 years, so his current age is:
\[ 30 - 2 = 28. \]

Since Patrick is half the age of Robert, Patrick's current age is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14. \]

Now, let's summarize the reasoning in a blockquote:
<reasoning>
To find Patrick's current age, we first determine Robert's current age by subtracting 2 from 30, which gives us 28. Then, since Patrick is half the age of Robert, we divide Robert's current age by 2, resulting in 14. Therefore, Patrick's current age is 14.

system
To determine Patrick's current age, we first need to find Robert's current age. Since Robert will turn 30 after 2 years, we can calculate his current age by subtracting 2 from 30. 

Robert's current age = 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Given that Patrick is half the age of his elder brother Robert, we can find Patrick's age by dividing Robert's age by 2.

Patrick's age = Robert's age / 2 = 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

Therefore, Patrick is currently 14 years old.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Robert will turn 30 after 2 years.
   - So, Robert's current age is 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
2. Patrick is half the age of Robert.
   - So, Patrick's age is 1/2 * 28 = 14 years old.

Therefore, Patrick is currently 14 years old.

Let's denote Robert's current age as R and Patrick's current age as P.

According to the problem, Robert will turn 30 after 2 years. This means his current age is 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Patrick is half the age of Robert, so we can write this relationship as:
\[ P = \frac{1}{2}R \]

Given that Robert is 28 years old, we can substitute R with 28:
\[ P = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \]

Now we calculate Patrick's age:
\[ P = 14 \]

Therefore, the answer is 14 years old.

#### GENERATION 11 RESPONSE ####

Let's denote Robert's current age as \( R \).

Given that Robert will turn 30 after 2 years, we can calculate his current age by subtracting 2 years from his future age:
\[ R + 2 = 30 \]
\[ R = 30 - 2 \]
\[ R = 28 \]

Since Robert is 28 years old and Patrick is half his age, we can find Patrick's current age by dividing Robert's age by 2:
\[ \text{Patrick's age} = \frac{R}{2} \]
\[ \text{Patrick's age} = \frac{28}{2} \]
\[ \text{Patrick's age} = 14 \]

Therefore, Patrick is currently 14 years old.

To determine Patrick's current age, we first need to calculate Robert's current age. Since Robert will be 30 years old after 2 years, we subtract 2 from 30 to get his current age.

\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \]

So, Robert is currently 28 years old.

Next, we know that Patrick is half the age of Robert. Therefore, we divide Robert's current age by 2 to find Patrick's age.

\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Patrick is currently 14 years old.
