#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To solve this problem, we first need to determine Alani's hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked:

\[
\text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Number of Hours}} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Now that we know Alani earns $15 per hour, we can calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn $75. We do this by dividing the total amount she wants to earn by her hourly rate:

\[
\text{Number of Hours} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Hourly Rate}} = \frac{75}{15} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Alani would need to baby-sit for 5 hours to earn $75 at the same rate.

To determine how many hours Alani needs to baby-sit to earn $75 at the same rate, we first need to find out her hourly rate.

Alani earned $45 for 3 hours of baby-sitting. Therefore, her hourly rate is:
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\$45}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$15 \text{ per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours she needs to baby-sit to earn $75 at this hourly rate. We can use the formula:
\[ \text{Number of hours} = \frac{\$75}{\text{Hourly rate}} \]

Substituting the hourly rate we calculated:
\[ \text{Number of hours} = \frac{\$75}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Alani would need to baby-sit for 5 hours to earn $75.

To find out how many hours Alani needs to baby-sit to earn $75, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Alani's hourly rate of pay by dividing her total earnings by the number of hours she worked.
2. Use that hourly rate to find out how many hours she would need to work to earn $75.

**Step 1: Calculate Alani's hourly rate of pay**

Alani earned $45 for 3 hours of baby-sitting.
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Total hours}} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

So, Alani earns $15 per hour.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of hours needed to earn $75**

Now we know Alani's hourly rate is $15, we can calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn $75.
\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\text{Total desired earnings}}{\text{Hourly rate}} = \frac{75}{15} = 5 \]

Therefore, Alani would need to baby-sit for 5 hours to earn $75.

To determine how many hours Alani needs to baby-sit to earn $75, we first need to find her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours
Hourly rate = $45 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $15 per hour

Now that we know Alani earns $15 for every hour she works, we can calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn $75.

Hours needed to earn $75 = Total earnings needed
Hours needed to earn $75 = $75 / $15 per hour
Hours needed to earn $75 = 5 hours

Therefore, Alani would need to baby-sit for 5 hours to earn $75.

First, we determine the rate at which Alani earns per hour babysitting. She earned $45 for 3 hours, so her rate is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{45 \text{ dollars}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 15 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hours she needs to babysit to earn $75 at her rate of 15 dollars per hour. We set up the equation:

\[
\text{Rate} \times \text{Number of hours} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Substituting the known rate into the equation:

\[
15 \text{ dollars per hour} \times \text{Number of hours} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

To solve for the number of hours, we divide both sides of the equation by 15:

\[
\text{Number of hours} = \frac{75 \text{ dollars}}{15 \text{ dollars per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Alani would need to babysit for 5 hours to earn $75.

To determine how many hours Alani would need to baby-sit to earn $75 at the same rate, we can set up a proportion based on the information given.

First, let's identify the variables:
- Rate of earning: $45 for 3 hours
- We need to find the number of hours to earn $75.

Let \( x \) represent the number of hours needed to earn $75. We can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{45}{3} = \frac{75}{x}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[
45x = 3 \times 75
\]

\[
45x = 225
\]

Now, divide both sides by 45 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{225}{45}
\]

\[
x = 5
\]

So, Alani would need to baby-sit for 5 hours to earn $75.

   \text{Hourly wage} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of hours needed to earn $75:**
   Now that we know Alani earns $15 per hour, we need to find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $75. We set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings needed}}{\text{Hourly wage rate}} = \frac{75}{15} = 5 \text{ hours}

To determine how many hours Alani needs to baby-sit to earn $75, we first need to find her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing her total earnings by the number of hours she worked.

Alani's hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Alani's hourly rate = $45 / 3 hours = $15 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn $75.

Let's denote the number of hours she needs to work to earn $75 as \( h \). We can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 \text{ (dollars per hour)} \times h = 75 \text{ (dollars)} \]

To solve for \( h \), we divide both sides by 15:

\[ h = \frac{75}{15} \]
\[ h = 5 \]

Therefore, Alani would need to baby-sit for 5 hours to earn $75 at the same rate.
