###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?

#### ANS ####

42
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Julie read 12 pages yesterday and twice as many today, so today she read 2 * 12 = 24 pages.

The total number of pages she has read so far is 12 + 24 = 36.

The remaining pages in the book are 120 - 36 = 84 pages.

Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, so she should read 84 / 2 = 42 pages.

Therefore, the answer is 42.

<reasoning>
Julie read 12 pages yesterday and twice that amount today, which means she read 12*2 = 24 pages. The total pages read so far is 12+24 = 36 pages. The number of remaining pages is 120-36 = 84 pages. She wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, so she needs to read 84/2 = 42 pages tomorrow.

To determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, let's calculate her total reading so far:

1. Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.
2. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pages.

Adding these together:
12 (yesterday) + 24 (today) = 36 pages read in total so far.

Now, to find out the remaining pages she needs to read:

120 total pages - 36 pages read = 84 pages remaining.

Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow:

84 pages / 2 = 42 pages.

So, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.

Julie read 12 pages yesterday and twice as many as yesterday today, which is 12 x 2 = 24 pages.

She was able to read 12 + 24 = 36 pages on the two days.

She read 120 - 36 = 84 pages as the remaining pages.

She wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow which is 84 / 2 = 42 pages.

Therefore, the answer is 42.

Initially, Julie read 12 pages yesterday. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she has read so far is \(12 + 24 = 36\) pages. The book has 120 pages, so the remaining pages are \(120 - 36 = 84\) pages.

If Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, she should read \(\frac{84}{2} = 42\) pages tomorrow.

Julie read 12 pages yesterday and twice that amount today, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pages. In total, she read 12 + 24 = 36 pages. There are 36 pages she has not read out of the 120-page book. Half of that amount is 120 / 2 = 60 pages. 

Since she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, Julie should read 60 pages tomorrow.

To determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, we first need to calculate the total number of pages she has read so far and then find the remaining pages.

1. **Pages read yesterday:**
   Julie read 12 pages yesterday.

2. **Pages read today:**
   Julie read twice as many pages today as she did yesterday. Therefore, the number of pages she read today is:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pages}
   \]

3. **Total pages read so far:**
   Adding the pages read yesterday and today:
   \[
   12 + 24 = 36 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. **Pages remaining to read:**
   Since the book has 120 pages, the number of pages remaining is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84 \text{ pages}
   \]

5. **Pages to read tomorrow:**
   Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Therefore, the number of pages she should read tomorrow is:
   \[
   \frac{84}{2} = 42 \text{ pages}
   \]

Thus, Julie should read \boxed{42} pages tomorrow.

To determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Find out how many pages Julie read today:
   Julie read 12 pages yesterday and twice as many today. So, today she read \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pages.

2. Calculate the total number of pages read in the first two days:
   Julie read 12 pages yesterday and 24 pages today. So, in total, she read \(12 + 24 = 36\) pages.

3. Find out how many pages are left in the book:
   The book has 120 pages. If Julie has read 36 pages, the remaining pages are \(120 - 36 = 84\) pages.

4. Determine how many pages she should read tomorrow:
   Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. So, she should read \(\frac{84}{2} = 42\) pages tomorrow.

Therefore, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.

To determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pages Julie has read so far.
2. Determine the number of pages remaining in the book.
3. Calculate half of the remaining pages for tomorrow.

First, let's find out how many pages Julie read yesterday:
\[ \text{Pages read yesterday} = 12 \]

Today, she read twice as many pages as she read yesterday:
\[ \text{Pages read today} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Julie has read so far:
\[ \text{Total pages read} = 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Now, let's find out how many pages are remaining in the book:
\[ \text{Remaining pages} = 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow:
\[ \text{Pages to read tomorrow} = \frac{84}{2} = 42 \]

Therefore, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.

To find out how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, we first need to calculate the total number of pages she has read so far.

Yesterday, she read 12 pages.
Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pages.

So far, she has read \(12 + 24 = 36\) pages from the book.

The book has 120 pages in total, so the remaining pages are \(120 - 36 = 84\) pages.

If Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, she should read \(84 \div 2 = 42\) pages.

Therefore, the number of pages Julie should read tomorrow is 42.

To determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pages Julie has read so far.
2. Determine the number of pages remaining in the book.
3. Compute half of the remaining pages, which is what she wants to read tomorrow.

First, let's find out how many pages Julie read today:
\[ 12 \text{ pages (yesterday)} + 2 \times 12 \text{ pages (today)} = 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pages Julie has read:
\[ 12 \text{ pages (yesterday)} + 36 \text{ pages (today)} = 48 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we determine the number of pages remaining in the book:
\[ 120 \text{ pages (total)} - 48 \text{ pages (read)} = 72 \text{ pages} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, which is half of the remaining pages:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pages}}{2} = 36 \text{ pages} \]

So, Julie should read \(\boxed{36}\) pages tomorrow.

To determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, we first need to calculate the total number of pages she has already read.

Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pages} \]

Adding the pages read yesterday and today gives the total number of pages read so far:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ pages} \]

The book has a total of 120 pages. To find the number of pages remaining after she has read 36 pages, we subtract the pages read from the total number of pages:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ pages} \]

Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Therefore, we calculate half of 84:
\[ \frac{84}{2} = 42 \text{ pages} \]

So, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.
