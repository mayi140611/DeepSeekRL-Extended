#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Lisa, Jack, and Tommy earned a total of $60. Since half of the $60 was earned by Lisa, Lisa earned $60 / 2 = $30. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, so Tommy earned $30 / 2 = $15. To find out how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy, subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings: $30 - $15 = $15.

Therefore, Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

Let's reason through this step-by-step:
1. First, we need to determine how much money Lisa, Jack, and Tommy earned in total. They earned $60 all week.
2. Half of this amount was earned by Lisa, which means Lisa earned $60 / 2 = $30.
3. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, so Tommy earned $30 / 2 = $15.
4. Now we need to find out how much money Lisa earned more than Tommy. We subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings: $30 - $15 = $15.
5. If Lisa earned $30 and Tommy earned $15, then Lisa earned an additional $15 more than Tommy.

Answer:
Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

Reasoning:
To determine how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate how much money Lisa earned. Since half of the money was earned by Lisa, we divide the total by 2: 
\( 60 \div 2 = 30 \) dollars.

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Tommy earned. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, so we calculate:
\( 30 \div 2 = 15 \) dollars.

3. Finally, to find out how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy, we subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings:
\( 30 - 15 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

Answer:
Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

Let's break down the information given:
1. Lisa, Jack, and Tommy earned a total of $60.
2. Half of the total earning was earned by Lisa.
3. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned.

Let's compute this step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Lisa's earnings
Half of the total earning is:
\[ \text{Lisa's earnings} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Tommy's earnings
Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned:
\[ \text{Tommy's earnings} = \frac{\text{Lisa's earnings}}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how much more Lisa earned than Tommy
Subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Lisa's earnings} - \text{Tommy's earnings} = 30 - 15 = 15 \]

Therefore, Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

### Conclusion:
Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

We start by determining how much Lisa earned. The problem states that half of the $60 was earned by Lisa. Therefore, Lisa earned:
\[
\frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the problem states that Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned. So, Tommy earned:
\[
\frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now we want to find out how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy. We do this by subtracting Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings:
\[
30 - 15 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Hence, Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

Next, we need to find out how much Tommy earned. Since Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, we calculate the amount as follows:
\[ \text{Tommy's earnings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30.00 = 15.00 \]

Finally, we need to find out how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy. We do this by subtracting Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings:

Reasoning:
To find out how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy, we first need to figure out how much each person earned individually. We know that Lisa earned half of the total amount, Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned. 

1. Lisa earned half of $60, which is $30.
2. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, which is $15.

Now we can calculate the difference in their earnings.

Solution:
To find out how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy, we subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings:
Lisa's earnings - Tommy's earnings = $30 - $15 = $15

Therefore, Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

To find out how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy, we first need to calculate how much each person earned. 

Lisa's earnings are half of the total, so:
Lisa's earnings = \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dollars

Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, so Tommy's earnings are:
Tommy's earnings = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) dollars

Now that we know both Lisa and Tommy's earnings, we can calculate the difference:

Difference = Lisa's earnings - Tommy's earnings
Difference = 30 dollars - 15 dollars
Difference = 15 dollars

Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.
