<reasoning>
To determine how much time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks, we first need to understand the daily jogging duration and then multiply by the number of days in two weeks.

1. Convert the jogging time from hours and minutes to just hours:
   - 1 hour 30 minutes is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

2. Calculate the total jogging time for one day:
   - One day, he jogs for 1.5 hours.

3. Determine the number of days in two weeks:
   - Two weeks is equivalent to 14 days.

4. Calculate the total jogging time for two weeks:
   - Total jogging time = 1.5 hours/day * 14 days = 21 hours.

Therefore, Mr. John will have spent 21 hours jogging after two weeks.

To determine how much time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, two weeks would be:
\[2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days}\]

Next, we know that Mr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes each day. To simplify our calculation, we need to convert 1 hour 30 minutes into hours. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, 1 hour 30 minutes is:
\[1 + \frac{1}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

Now, we multiply the number of days (14) by the number of hours he jogs each day (1.5 hours):
\[14 \times 1.5 = 21 \text{ hours}\]

So, Mr. John will have spent 21 hours jogging after two weeks.

Mr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes each day. First, we need to convert the jogging time into hours. Since 1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours, we need to calculate the total jogging time for 2 weeks.
- In one week, there are 7 days.
- He jogs for 1.5 hours each day.
- For two weeks, he would jog for \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.
- Therefore, the total jogging time would be \(14 \times 1.5 = 21\) hours.

After jogging for 21 hours, we can conclude that Mr. John will have spent 21 hours jogging after two weeks.

To determine how much time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks, we need to calculate the daily jogging time and then multiply it by the number of days in two weeks.

First, convert the total jogging time into hours:
- Mr. John jogs for 1 hour and 30 minutes each day.
- Since 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours, his total jogging time each day is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

Next, calculate the total jogging time for two weeks:
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, the time spent jogging in two weeks is \( 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ hours} \).

So, the total time spent jogging after two weeks is 21 hours.

To determine how much time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks, we need to first calculate the total number of days in two weeks and then multiply that by the number of hours he jogs per day.

1. One week consists of 7 days. Therefore, two weeks consist of \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.
2. Mr. John jogs for 1 hour and 30 minutes each day. First, we need to convert 1 hour and 30 minutes into hours:
   \[1 \text{ hour and } 30 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]
3. Now, we multiply the number of days by the jogging time per day:
   \[14 \text{ days} \times 1.5 \text{ hours/day} = 21 \text{ hours}\]

So, Mr. John will have spent 21 hours jogging after two weeks.

First, we need to convert the jogging period from minutes to hours. Mr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes in the morning each day. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so 1 hour 30 minutes is equal to 60 + 30 = 90 minutes. Converting 90 minutes to hours gives us 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of days in two weeks, which is 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days.

Now, to find the total time spent jogging after two weeks, we multiply the daily jogging time by the total number of days: 1.5 hours/day * 14 days = 21 hours.

Therefore, after two weeks, Mr. John will have spent 21 hours jogging.

To determine how much time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks, we need to calculate the total time he spends jogging each day and then extend that to two weeks.

First, let's convert the jogging duration from hours and minutes into just hours. Mr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
\]
So, Mr. John jogs for:
\[
1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours per day}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the number of days in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[
2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 14 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days to find the total jogging time in hours:
\[
1.5 \text{ hours per day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Mr. John will have spent 21 hours jogging after two weeks.
