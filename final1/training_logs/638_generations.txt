###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Alex makes luxury dresses out of silk. Each dress needs 5 meters of silk and Alex has 600 meters of silk in storage. His friends also want to learn how to make these dresses so Alex gives all 5 of them 20 meters of silk each. He uses the rest to make dresses himself. How many dresses can Alex make?

#### ANS ####

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine how many dresses Alex can make, we start by calculating the total amount of silk Alex gives to his friends. Because he gives each of 5 friends 20 meters of silk, the total silk given to his friends is:

\[ 5 \times 20 = 100 \text{ meters} \]

Initially, Alex has 600 meters of silk. After giving silk to his friends, the remaining silk he has is:

\[ 600 - 100 = 500 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining 500 meters of silk. Since each dress requires 5 meters of silk, the number of dresses Alex can make is:

\[ \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]

Thus, Alex can make 100 dresses.

Initially, Alex has 600 meters of silk. He gives each of his 5 friends 20 meters of silk. Therefore, the total amount of silk given to his friends is 5 friends * 20 meters = 100 meters.

After giving silk to his friends, Alex has 600 meters - 100 meters = 500 meters of silk left.

Each dress requires 5 meters of silk. To find out how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining silk, we calculate 500 meters / 5 meters per dress = 100 dresses.

Thus, Alex can make 100 dresses with the remaining silk.

system
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of silk Alex gives to his friends. Since he has 5 friends and each friend gets 20 meters of silk, the total amount of silk given to friends is \(5 \times 20 = 100\) meters.

Next, we subtract this amount from the total amount of silk Alex has to find out how much is left for making dresses. So, \(600 - 100 = 500\) meters of silk remain.

Since each dress requires 5 meters of silk, the number of dresses Alex can make from the remaining silk is \(500 \div 5 = 100\) dresses.

Therefore, the total number of dresses Alex can make is 100 dresses.

First, we calculate the amount of silk Alex gives his friends. Given that Alex has 5 friends and gives each 20 meters of silk:

\[ 5 \text{ friends} \times 20 \text{ meters/friend} = 100 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we subtract the silk given to his friends from the total amount of silk Alex has:

\[ 600 \text{ meters} - 100 \text{ meters} = 500 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we determine how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining 500 meters of silk, knowing that each dress requires 5 meters of silk:

\[ \text{Number of dresses} = \frac{500 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ meters/dress}} = 100 \text{ dresses} \]

Thus, Alex can make 100 dresses with the remaining silk.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Alex starts with 600 meters of silk.
2. He gives each of his 5 friends 20 meters of silk, so 5 friends * 20 meters = 100 meters.
3. The remaining silk after giving it to his friends is: 600 meters (total) - 100 meters (given to friends) = 500 meters.

Now, Alex wants to make dresses with the remaining silk. Each dress needs 5 meters of silk.

To find out how many dresses Alex can make, we divide the remaining silk by the amount needed for one dress:

500 meters / 5 meters per dress = 100 dresses

So, Alex can make 100 dresses.

Reasoning:
First, we need to determine the total amount of silk that Alex gives to his friends. Since each of his 5 friends receives 20 meters of silk, we calculate the total as follows:
\[ 5 \text{ friends} \times 20 \text{ meters/friend} = 100 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we subtract the silk given to his friends from the total amount of silk Alex has:
\[ 600 \text{ meters} - 100 \text{ meters} = 500 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining 500 meters of silk. Since each dress requires 5 meters of silk, we divide the remaining silk by the amount needed for one dress:
\[ 500 \text{ meters} \div 5 \text{ meters/dress} = 100 \text{ dresses} \]

Therefore, Alex can make 100 dresses.

To determine how many dresses Alex can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of silk given to his friends.
2. Subtract the amount given to his friends from the total silk available to find the remaining silk.
3. Determine how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining silk.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of silk given to his friends.
Alex has 5 friends, and each friend gets 20 meters of silk.
\[ 5 \times 20 = 100 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount given to his friends from the total silk available.
Alex originally has 600 meters of silk.
\[ 600 - 100 = 500 \text{ meters} \]

Step 3: Determine how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining silk.
Each dress requires 5 meters of silk. To find out how many dresses can be made, we divide the remaining silk by the silk needed per dress.
\[ \frac{500}{5} = 100 \text{ dresses} \]

Therefore, Alex can make 100 dresses.
