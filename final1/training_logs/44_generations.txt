system
Let's calculate this step by step.

1. James's total budget is $1000.
2. He spends 30% of his budget on food.
   30% of $1000 = \(0.30 \times 1000 = $300\) on food.
3. He spends 15% of his budget on accommodation.
   15% of $1000 = \(0.15 \times 1000 = $150\) on accommodation.
4. He spends 25% of his budget on entertainment.
   25% of $1000 = \(0.25 \times 1000 = $250\) on entertainment.
5. The remaining budget for coursework materials is calculated by subtracting the amount spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment from the total budget.
   Remaining budget = $1000 - ($300 + $150 + $250) = $1000 - $700 = $300.

Therefore, James spends $300 on coursework materials.

To find out how much James spends on coursework materials, we first need to calculate his total spending on food, accommodation, and entertainment.

Total spending = Food expenditure + Accommodation expenditure + Entertainment expenditure
Total spending = 30% of $1000 + 15% of $1000 + 25% of $1000

Now, we calculate each part:

Food = 30% of $1000 = 0.30 * $1000 = $300
Accommodation = 15% of $1000 = 0.15 * $1000 = $150
Entertainment = 25% of $1000 = 0.25 * $1000 = $250

Total spending = $300 + $150 + $250 = $700

Now, we subtract this total from his budget to find out how much he spends on coursework materials:

Coursework materials = Total budget - Total spending
Coursework materials = $1000 - $700 = $300

So, James spends $300 on coursework materials.

<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate how much money James spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment. He spends 30% on food, 15% on accommodation, and 25% on entertainment. We then subtract the total spent on these items from his total budget of $1000 to find out how much he spends on coursework materials.

Next, we calculate the total percentage spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment, and then subtract that from 100% to get the percentage spent on coursework materials. Finally, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Cost of coursework materials} = \text{Total budget} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage spent on coursework materials}}{100}\right) \]
To calculate the actual value, let's first perform the calculations.
</reasoning>

<answer>
\[ 0.3 \times 1000 = 300 \] dollars on food.

\[ 0.15 \times 1000 = 150 \] dollars on accommodation.

\[ 0.25 \times 1000 = 250 \] dollars on entertainment.

\[ 300 + 150 + 250 = 700 \] dollars has been spent on these three sectors.

\[ 1000 - 700 = 300 \] dollars are left for coursework materials.

\[ \text{Cost of coursework materials} = 1000 \times \left(\frac{300}{1000}\right) = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's calculate how much James spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment:

- Food: 30% of $1000 = $300
- Accommodation: 15% of $1000 = $150
- Entertainment: 25% of $1000 = $250

Now, let's find out the total amount spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment:

- Total for food, accommodation, and entertainment = $300 + $150 + $250 = $700

Finally, to find out how much money he spends on coursework materials, we subtract the total spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment from the total budget:

- Budget for coursework materials = $1000 - $700 = $300

Therefore, James spends $300 on coursework materials.

To determine how much James spends on coursework materials, we'll first calculate the portion of his budget allocated to each category and then subtract these amounts from his total budget.

James spends:
- 30% on food
- 15% on accommodation
- 25% on entertainment

First, calculate the total percentage accounted for by food, accommodation, and entertainment:

Food: 30%
Accommodation: 15%
Entertainment: 25%

Summing these percentages:

30% + 15% + 25% = 70%

This means 70% of his budget is accounted for by food, accommodation, and entertainment. Subtract this total from 100% to find the remaining percentage for coursework materials:

100% - 70% = 30%

Now, calculate 30% of his total budget of $1000:

30% of $1000 = 0.30 * $1000 = $300

Therefore, James spends $300 on coursework materials.

Let's break down the spending:

2. Accommodation: 15% of $1000 = $150
3. Entertainment: 25% of $1000 = $250

The rest is spent on coursework materials, which can be calculated as follows:

Total money spent = Food + Accommodation + Entertainment
Total money spent = $300 + $150 + $250
Total money spent = $700

We know James has a $1000 budget, so for coursework materials:

Money for coursework materials = Total budget - Money spent on food + accommodation + entertainment
Money for coursework materials = $1000 - $700
Money for coursework materials = $300

Therefore, James spends $300 on coursework materials.

- Entertainment: 25% of $1000 = \( \frac{25}{100} \times 1000 = 250 \) dollars

Now, add up the money spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment:

Total spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment = 300 + 150 + 250 = 700 dollars

Subtract this amount from the total budget to find out how much James spends on coursework materials:

Money spent on coursework materials = Total budget - Total spent on other categories = $1000 - $700 = 300 dollars

Therefore, James spends 300 dollars on coursework materials.

To calculate the amount of money James spends on coursework materials, you start by finding the total percentage of money spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment. The sum of these percentages is 70%, because 30% (food) + 15% (accommodation) + 25% (entertainment) = 70%. Subtracting this sum from 100% will reveal the percentage spent on coursework materials, which is 30%. Therefore, the amount of money spent on coursework materials is 30% of $1000.

$$
\text{Cost of coursework materials} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 1000 \times 0.3 = 300

To find out how much James spends on coursework materials, we need to calculate the total amount he spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment. We can do this by subtracting the percentages of his budget spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment from 100%.

The total spend on food, accommodation, and entertainment is:
30% (food) + 15% (accommodation) + 25% (entertainment) = 70%

Now, we subtract this from 100% to find out the percentage spent on coursework materials:
100% - 70% = 30%

The remaining 30% of his budget goes towards coursework materials. 

To calculate the amount he spends on coursework materials:
30% of $1000 = 0.30 x $1000 = $300

So, James spends $300 on coursework materials.

First, we need to calculate the total percentage of money that James spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment. This is done by adding up his spending on each category: 30% (food) + 15% (accommodation) + 25% (entertainment) = 70%. Since the total percentage should be 100%, the percentage left for coursework materials is 100% - 70% = 30%. 

Next, we need to calculate how much money this amounts to, which is 30% of his $1000 budget. This can be found by multiplying his total budget by the percentage left for coursework materials: $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

Therefore, the answer is $300.
