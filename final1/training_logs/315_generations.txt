The amount of food is sufficient for 300 * 90 = 27,000 person-days. There are 90 - 30 = 60 days left unless 100 people leave. That's 300 - 100 = 200 people left to feed. That's 27,000 / 200 = 135 days.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of food available and then determine how much food is left after 30 days and the subsequent reduction in the number of people.

Initially, there are enough provisions to feed 300 people for 90 days. This means that the total amount of food is the product of the number of people and the number of days they can be fed, which is:
\[ 300 \text{ people} \times 90 \text{ days} = 27,000 \text{ person-days} \]

After 30 days, the food has been consumed for 30 days, so the remaining food is:
\[ 27,000 \text{ person-days} - 30 \text{ person-days} = 26,700 \text{ person-days} \]

After 30 days, 100 people leave, so the number of people left is:
\[ 300 \text{ people} - 100 \text{ people} = 200 \text{ people} \]

We need to find out how many more days the remaining food will last for 200 people. This can be calculated by dividing the remaining food by the number of people left:
\[ \frac{26,700 \text{ person-days}}{200 \text{ people}} = 133.5 \text{ days} \]

So, the number of days left until all the food runs out is 133.5 days.

To determine how many more days the food will last after 100 people leave, we need to calculate how many people are left in the castle and how long the food will last based on that new number.

First, after 30 days, the amount of food consumed can be calculated as follows:
- 300 people for 30 days = 300 * 30 days = 9,000 person-days of food.

This means the provisions will last a certain number of days per person, which is \( \frac{9000 \text{ person-days}}{300 \text{ people}} = 30 \text{ person-days/ person} \).

After 30 days, 100 people leave, leaving 200 people in the castle.

Now we need to find out how many days the 9,000 person-days of food will last with 200 people:
\[ \text{Days remaining} = \frac{9000 \text{ person-days}}{200 \text{ people}} = 45 \text{ days}. \]

Since the provision allows for 45 days with 200 people, after 100 people leave, 45 more days will be available, but with 100 people left. The food will last \( \frac{9000 \text{ person-days}}{100 \text{ people}} = 90 \text{ days} \).

Finally, we need to subtract the 30 days that have already passed after 100 people leave:
\[ 90 \text{ days} - 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ days}. \]

Therefore, there are 60 more days until all the food runs out.

Initially, there are enough provisions for 300 people for 90 days. After 30 days, 300 - 100 = 200 people are left, and the remaining provisions are sufficient for 90 - 30 = 60 days.
There are now 200 people left, and food is still sufficient for 60 days, or for 200 * 60 = 12000 person-days of food.
The food will last 12000 / 200 = 60 days longer.

Initially, there are provisions enough to feed 300 people for 90 days. This means the total amount of provisions is \(300 \times 90\) days of food.

After 30 days, the provisions are used up, and the remaining amount is \(270\) days of food (since \(90 - 30 = 60\)) for the initial 300 people.

With 100 people leaving, the remaining people are \(300 - 100 = 200\). The amount of food per person per day is \(\frac{270}{200}\).

The total remaining provisions, when divided by the new number of people (200) and the number of days left (60), should give the remaining days until all the food runs out. We calculate:
\[ \text{Remaining days} = \frac{270}{200 \times 60} \]

</reasoning>
<answer>
\[ \frac{270}{200 \times 60} = \frac{270}{12000} = 0.0225 \]
</answer>
<reasoning>
The remaining provisions are \(270\) days of food for the remaining 200 people. Since \(270 \times 0.0225 = 6.075\) days, which is not an integer, we round up to the next whole day to ensure all provisions are utilized. Thus, the food will run out in 7 days.

There are 7 more days until all the food runs out.

Initially, the provisions are enough to feed 300 people for 90 days. After 30 days, the provisions left are enough to feed 300 people for \( (90 - 30) \) days, i.e., 60 days. This means the remaining provisions are enough for 300 people for 60 days. If 100 people leave after 30 days, there are only 200 people left to be fed. Since the remaining provisions are enough for 300 people for 60 days, they are also sufficient for 200 people for 60 days. Therefore, the 200 people will be able to consume the remaining provisions for 2 more days.

The calculation is as follows: 
- After 30 days, the provisions left are enough for 300 people for 60 days.
- After 60 days, the provisions left are enough for 300 people for 30 days.
- If 100 people leave, 200 people are left to be fed.
- Therefore, for the 200 people, the provisions are enough for 2 more days.

The answer is 2 days.

Initially, enough provisions are enough to feed 300 people for 90 days. 

After 30 days, some provisions have been used, and the amount of food left can be calculated:
1. The total food originally equals the provisions for 90 days, enough to feed 300 people.
2. After the first 30 days, the remaining food can feed \(300 \times (90 - 30) = 300 \times 60 = 18000\) people for 60 days.

Now, with 100 people leaving, the total number of people left is \(300 - 100 = 200\).

We need to determine how many more days \(t\) it would take for these 200 people to finish the remaining food that can now feed 18000 people for 60 days, but for only 200 people.

Since the amount of provisions is proportional to the number of people who are still living, we can calculate the number of days by:
\[ t = \frac{18000 \times 60}{200} = 18000 \times 0.6 \]
\[ t = 10800 \]

So, \(t = 10800\) days is the initial calculation, but there is a mistake. We understand the provisions can be shared among the remaining 200 people. So, we directly calculate the remaining days by the equation where \(t = \frac{18000}{200}\) days.

Now, after removing the correct initial setup and recalculating:

\[ t = \frac{18000}{200} = 90 \]

The provisions can be distributed among the remaining 200 people for 90 more days.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the initial conditions and how the provisions are being used.

Initially, there are enough provisions to feed 300 people for 90 days. This means:
\[ 300 \text{ people} \times 90 \text{ days} = 27,000 \text{ provisions} \]

After 30 days, the provisions used are:
\[ 300 \text{ people} \times 30 \text{ days} = 9,000 \text{ provisions} \]

So, the remaining provisions are:
\[ 27,000 \text{ provisions} - 9,000 \text{ provisions} = 18,000 \text{ provisions} \]

Next, 100 people leave the castle, reducing the number of people to:
\[ 300 - 100 = 200 \text{ people} \]

To find out how many more days the food will last for these 200 people, we divide the remaining provisions by the number of people left:
\[ \frac{18,000 \text{ provisions}}{200 \text{ people}} = 90 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the remaining days until all the food runs out are 90 days.

Reasoning:
Initially, 300 people can be fed for 90 days, so the total amount of food is enough for 300 * 90 = 27,000 person-days.
After 30 days, the remaining food is enough for 300 - 100 = 200 people for 60 days, which amounts to 200 * 60 = 12,000 person-days.
This leaves 27,000 - 12,000 = 15,000 person-days of food for the remaining 100 people.
To find out how many more days the food will last for 100 people, we divide the remaining person-days by the number of people: 15,000 / 100 = 150 days.

To determine how many more days the food will last after 100 people leave, we need to first calculate the total amount of provisions consumed in the first 30 days and then find out how long the remaining provisions will last for the remaining people.

1. Calculate the total amount of provisions in terms of "person-days":
   - The provisions can feed 300 people for 90 days, so the total amount of provisions is \(300 \times 90 = 27000\) person-days.

2. Calculate the amount of provisions consumed in the first 30 days:
   - In 30 days, 300 people will consume \(300 \times 30 = 9000\) person-days of provisions.

3. Calculate the remaining provisions after 30 days:
   - After 30 days, the remaining provisions are \(27000 - 9000 = 18000\) person-days.

4. Determine how long the remaining provisions will last for the remaining 200 people:
   - With 200 people, the remaining provisions will last for \(\frac{18000}{200} = 90\) days.

5. Calculate the total number of days the provisions will last after 100 people leave:
   - After 100 people leave, the remaining provisions will last for the original 90 days plus the additional 90 days, so the total is 180 days.

Therefore, the number of days left until all the food runs out is 180 days.

Initially, the castle has provisions to feed 300 people for 90 days, which means the total amount of provisions is equivalent to \(300 \times 90\) days of consumption.

After 30 days, the provisions left are for \(300 \times 60\) days (since the 30 original days of consumption is subtracted from the 90 original days, leaving 60 more days' consumption).

If 100 people leave, then the remaining people are \(300 - 100 = 200\). We need to find out how many more days the remaining provisions will last for 200 people.

To do this, we divide the remaining provisions by the number of remaining people:
\[
\text{More days} = \frac{300 \times 60}{200}
\]

Simplifying this,
\[
\text{More days} = \frac{18000}{200} = 90

Therefore, there are 90 more days until all the food runs out.

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of food that has been consumed in the first 30 days and then determine how long the remaining food will last after 100 people leave.

Initially, there are enough provisions to feed 300 people for 90 days. Therefore, the total food is:
300 people * 90 days = 27,000 person-days

In the first 30 days, with a total of 300 people, the food consumed is:
300 people * 30 days = 9,000 person-days

After 30 days, 100 people leave, leaving 200 people in the castle. The food left from the first 30 days is:
9,000 person-days - 27,000 person-days = -18,000 person-days

This negative value indicates we've already surpassed the total amount of food available for 27,000 person-days. The remaining food is:
27,000 person-days - 9,000 person-days = 18,000 person-days

Now, with 200 people left, we need to determine how many more days the remaining food will last:
18,000 person-days / 200 people = 90 days

Therefore, after 100 people leave, the food will last for an additional 90 - 30 = 60 days.
