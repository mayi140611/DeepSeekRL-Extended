system
Jennifer starts with 10 pears and 20 oranges.

She has twice as many apples as pears, so she has \(2 \times 10 = 20\) apples.

Before giving any fruits away, she has a total of \(10 + 20 + 20 = 50\) fruits.

After giving her sister two of each type of fruit, she gives away \(2\) pears, \(2\) oranges, and \(2\) apples.

After giving these away, she has \(10 - 2 = 8\) pears, \(20 - 2 = 18\) oranges, and \(20 - 2 = 18\) apples.

So, the total number of fruits she has left is \(8 + 18 + 18 = 44\).

To determine how many fruits Jennifer has left after giving some to her sister, we'll first calculate the number of each type of fruit she has initially, then account for the fruits she gives away, and finally find out how many fruits she has left.

1. **Initial number of fruits:**
   - Pears: 10
   - Oranges: 20
   - Apples: Twice as many as pears, so \(2 \times 10 = 20\)

2. **Fruits given to her sister:**
   - Pears: 2
   - Oranges: 2
   - Apples: 2

3. **Fruits left after giving some:**
   - Pears left: \(10 - 2 = 8\)
   - Oranges left: \(20 - 2 = 18\)
   - Apples left: \(20 - 2 = 18\)

4. **Total fruits left:**
   - Total = Pears + Oranges + Apples
   - Total = 8 + 18 + 18 = 44

By following these steps, we can conclude that the number of fruits Jennifer has left is 44.

To find out how many fruits Jennifer has left, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of fruit she originally had.

- Jennifer has 10 pears.
- Jennifer has 20 oranges.
- Jennifer has twice as many apples as pears, so she has \(2 \times 10 = 20\) apples.

Adding these together, the total number of fruits Jennifer originally had is:
\[10 \text{ (pears)} + 20 \text{ (oranges)} + 20 \text{ (apples)} = 50 \text{ fruits}\]

Next, we need to account for the fruits she gives to her sister. She gives two of each fruit to her sister, so the total number of fruits given away is:
\[2 \text{ (pears)} + 2 \text{ (oranges)} + 2 \text{ (apples)} = 6 \text{ fruits}\]

Subtracting the number of fruits given to her sister from the original total, we get:
\[50 \text{ (original fruits)} - 6 \text{ (given away)} = 44 \text{ fruits}\]

So, Jennifer has 44 fruits left.

Initially, Jennifer has 10 pears, 20 oranges, and twice as many apples as pears, which means she has \(2 \times 10 = 20\) apples.

So, the total number of fruits Jennifer initially has is \(10\) pears + \(20\) oranges + \(20\) apples = \(50\) fruits.

If she gives her sister two of each fruit, she gives away \(2\) pears + \(2\) oranges + \(2\) apples = \(6\) fruits.

After giving her sister the fruits, the number of fruits Jennifer has left is \(50\) fruits - \(6\) fruits = \(44\) fruits.

Jennifer initially has 10 pears. Additionally, she has twice as many apples as pears, which means she has \(2 \times 10 = 20\) apples. She also has 20 oranges. 

After giving her sister two of each fruit, she will have:

- \(10 - 2 = 8\) pears left
- \(20 - 2 = 18\) oranges left
- \(20 - 2 = 18\) apples left

The total number of fruits she has left is \(8 + 18 + 18 = 44\).

Initially, Jennifer has:
- 10 pears
- 20 oranges
- Twice as many apples as pears, which is 2 * 10 = 20 apples

Total initial fruits = 10 pears + 20 oranges + 20 apples = 50 fruits

The next day, she gives 2 of each fruit to her sister, which means:
- 2 pears
- 2 oranges
- 4 apples (20 apples * 2/10)

Fruits given away = 2 pears + 2 oranges + 4 apples = 8 fruits

Fruits left = Total initial fruits - Fruits given away = 50 - 8 = 42 fruits

If she gives her sister two of each fruit, she will give away:

The number of fruits left after giving away two of each is:
- 10 - 2 = 8 pears

To find the total number of fruits left, we add these quantities together:
8 pears + 18 oranges + 18 apples = 44 fruits

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of each type of fruit Jennifer initially has. 

Given:
- Jennifer has 10 pears.
- She has 20 oranges.
- She has twice as many apples as pears. Since she has 10 pears, she has \(2 \times 10 = 20\) apples.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits she has initially:
Total fruits = Pears + Oranges + Apples
Total fruits = 10 + 20 + 20 = 50

Next, we need to determine how many fruits she gives to her sister. She gives 2 of each type of fruit to her sister:
Fruits given to sister = 2 pears + 2 oranges + 2 apples = 6 fruits

Finally, to find the number of fruits she has left, we subtract the number of fruits given to her sister from the total number of fruits she initially had:
Fruits left = Initial total fruits - Fruits given to sister
Fruits left = 50 - 6 = 44

Therefore, Jennifer has 44 fruits left.
