To determine how many times the ride operator will need to run the roller coaster, we first need to calculate the total number of people that can ride the roller coaster in one run. The roller coaster has 7 cars, and each car seats 2 people. Therefore, the total number of people that can ride in one run is:

\[ 7 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ people per car} = 14 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times the ride operator needs to run the roller coaster to accommodate all 84 people in line. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the number of people that can ride in one run:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ people}}{14 \text{ people per run}} = 6 \text{ runs} \]

So, the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster 6 times to give everyone in line a turn.

First, we need to calculate the total seating capacity of the roller coaster. Since there are 7 cars and each car seats 2 people, the total number of people the roller coaster can seat in one run is:
\[ 7 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ people per car} = 14 \text{ people per run} \]

Next, we need to determine how many times the roller coaster needs to run to seat all 84 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the seating capacity of each run:
\[ 84 \text{ people} \div 14 \text{ people per run} = 6 \text{ runs} \]

Therefore, the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster 6 times to give everyone in line a turn.

To calculate the total number of people that can be accommodated by one run of the roller coaster, we multiply the number of cars by the number of seats per car:

\[ \text{Number of seats per run} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Seats per car} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Now, to find out how many times the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster to accommodate all 84 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of seats per run:

\[ \text{Number of runs} = \frac{\text{Total number of people}}{\text{Number of seats per run}} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

So, the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster 6 times to give everyone in line a turn.

To determine how many times the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster, we need to calculate the total number of people that can be seated per run and then divide the total number of people by this amount.

First, we calculate the seating capacity per run:
- The roller coaster has 7 cars.
- Each car seats 2 people.
- Therefore, the total capacity per run is \(7 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ people per car} = 14 \text{ people per run}\).

Next, we determine how many runs are needed to seat all 84 people:
- The total number of people is 84.
- The capacity per run is 14 people.
- The number of runs required is \( \frac{84 \text{ people}}{14 \text{ people per run}} = 6 \text{ runs}\).

So, the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster 6 times to give everyone in line a turn.

To find out how many rides the roller coaster needs to complete to accommodate all the people in line, we first need to calculate the total seating capacity of the coaster.

Each car seats 2 people, and there are 7 cars, so the total seating capacity is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) people per ride.

If there are 84 people in line, and the coaster can hold 14 people per ride, we can find the number of rides needed by dividing the total number of people by the capacity per ride:

\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

So, the ride operator will need to run the roller coaster 6 times to give everyone in line a turn.

Total capacity per run = Number of cars * Capacity per car
Total capacity per run = 7 cars * 2 people = 14 people

To find out how many runs are needed for all 84 people:
Runs needed = Total people / Capacity per run
Runs needed = 84 people / 14 people = 6 runs

Thus, the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster 6 times to give everyone in line a turn.

To figure this out, we must first determine how many people can ride in one complete run of the roller coaster. Since there are 7 cars, and each car seats 2 people, there are a total of \(7 \times 2 = 14\) people that can ride in one run.

There are 84 people in line, so to find out how many times the ride operator needs to run the roller coaster, we divide the total number of people by the number that can ride in one run: \(84 \div 14 = 6\).

Therefore, the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster 6 times.

In order to determine how many times the ride operator needs to run the roller coaster, we first need to calculate the number of people that can ride in one run of the roller coaster.

Each roller coaster car seats 2 people, and there are 7 cars, so we can calculate the total number of people that can ride in one run as follows:

\[ \text{Total people per run} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Seats per car} \]
\[ \text{Total people per run} = 7 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total people per run} = 14 \]

Now that we have determined that 14 people can ride in one run, we need to find out how many runs are needed to accommodate 84 people.

\[ \text{Runs required} = \frac{\text{Total people}}{\text{People that can ride per run}} \]
\[ \text{Runs required} = \frac{84}{14} \]
\[ \text{Runs required} = 6 \]

So, the ride operator will need to run the roller coaster 6 times to give everyone in line a turn.

To determine how many times the ride operator needs to run the roller coaster, we first need to calculate the total seating capacity of the roller coaster.

Each car seats 2 people, and there are 7 cars. Therefore, the total number of seats is:
\[ 7 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ people per car} = 14 \text{ people per trip} \]

The line has 84 people waiting. To find out how many trips the roller coaster needs to make to accommodate everyone, we divide the total number of people by the seating capacity per trip:
\[ 84 \text{ people} \div 14 \text{ people per trip} = 6 \text{ trips} \]

Since the result is a whole number, the roller coaster will make exactly 6 trips to give everyone a turn. Therefore, the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster 6 times.
