Let's denote the side of the square paper as \( s \) and the height of the computer screen as \( h \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The perimeter of the square paper is \( 4s \).
2. The perimeter of the square paper is \( 20 \) cm shorter than the height of the computer screen, so \( 4s = h - 20 \).

We are also given that the side of the square paper (\( s \)) is \( 20 \) cm. So, we substitute \( s = 20 \) into the equation \( 4s = h - 20 \):

\[ 4 \times 20 = h - 20 \]
\[ 80 = h - 20 \]

Now, solve for \( h \):
\[ h = 80 + 20 \]
\[ h = 100 \]

So, the height of the computer screen (\( h \)) is \( 100 \) cm.

Let's denote the height of the computer screen as \( h \) cm. The perimeter of the square-shaped piece of paper is given as 20 cm shorter than the height of the screen. Since the paper is square-shaped, each side of the square is 20 cm.

The perimeter of the square can be calculated using the formula \( 4 \times \text{side length} \). Hence, the perimeter of the square is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) cm.

According to the problem, this perimeter is 20 cm shorter than the height of the screen. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ h = 80 + 20 \]

Now we solve for \( h \):
\[ h = 100 \]

So, the height of the computer screen is 100 cm.

Let the height of the computer screen be denoted by \( h \) (in cm).

The perimeter of the square-shaped piece of paper is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) cm.

According to the problem, the perimeter of the square is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 80 = h - 20 \]

Solving for \( h \):

\[ h = 80 + 20 \]
\[ h = 100 \]

Thus, the height of the screen is 100 cm.

Let's denote the height of the computer screen as \( h \) cm. 

First, we know that the perimeter of the square-shaped piece of paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4. So, the perimeter of the square paper is \( 4 \times 20 \) cm. Adding 20 cm to this, we get:

\[ 4 \times 20 + 20 = 80 + 20 = 100 \, \text{cm} \]

This 100 cm is equal to the height of the computer screen, so we have:

\[ h = 100 \, \text{cm} \]

Let's denote the height of the computer screen as \( h \) cm. The side of the square paper is given as 20 cm. Since a square has four equal sides, the perimeter of the square paper is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) cm.

According to the problem, the perimeter of the square paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ h = 80 + 20 \]
\[ h = 100 \]

So, the height of the computer screen is 100 cm.

Let's denote the side length of the square paper as \( s \). The perimeter of the square paper is \( 4s \). According to the problem, the perimeter of the square paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen. Therefore, if we denote the height of the computer screen as \( h \), we can write the equation:
\[ 4s = h - 20 \]
Since the side length of the square paper is given as 20 cm, we substitute \( s = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 4 \times 20 = h - 20 \]
\[ 80 = h - 20 \]
To find \( h \), we add 20 to both sides of the equation:
\[ h = 80 + 20 \]
\[ h = 100 \]
So, the height of the computer screen is 100 cm.

First, we need to find the perimeter of the square-shaped piece of paper. The side length of the square is given as 20 cm. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4. So, the perimeter of the square is:
$$
\text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{side length} = 4 \times 20 \text{ cm} = 80 \text{ cm}
$$

According to the problem, the perimeter of the square is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen. Let's denote the height of the computer screen as \( H \). Therefore, the relationship can be expressed as:
$$
\text{Perimeter} + 20 \text{ cm} = H
$$
Since we have already calculated the perimeter of the square to be 80 cm:
$$
80 \text{ cm} + 20 \text{ cm} = H
$$
Solving for \( H \):
$$
H = 100 \text{ cm}

Let's denote the height of the computer screen as \( h \) cm. Since the paper is square-shaped, its side length is given as 20 cm.

The perimeter of the square paper is calculated by the formula for the perimeter of a square:
\[
P = 4 \times \text{side length}
\]
Substituting the side length of the square:
\[
P = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ cm}
\]

According to the problem, the perimeter of the square paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen:
\[
h - 20 = 80
\]

To find the height of the screen (\( h \)), we solve the equation:
\[
h = 80 + 20 = 100
\]

Thus, the height of the screen is 100 cm.
