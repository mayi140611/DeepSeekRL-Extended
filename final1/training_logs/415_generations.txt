system
In mid-May, the river is 5 feet deep. By mid-June, it is 10 feet deeper, so:

Mid-June depth = Mid-May depth + Additional depth
Mid-June depth = 5 feet + 10 feet
Mid-June depth = 15 feet

By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. So:

Mid-July depth = 3 * Mid-June depth
Mid-July depth = 3 * 15 feet
Mid-July depth = 45 feet

To determine the depth of the river by mid-July, we'll follow the given information step by step.

1. In mid-May, the river is 5 feet deep.
2. By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. So, the depth of the river by mid-June is:
   \(5 + 10 = 15\) feet.
3. By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. Therefore, the depth of the river by mid-July is:
   \(15 \times 3 = 45\) feet.

So, the river is 45 feet deep by mid-July.
