<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of floors in the Chrysler Building as \( C \) and in the Leeward Center as \( L \). According to the information provided:

1. \( C = L + 11 \)
2. \( C + L = 35 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second to solve for \( C \):

\( (L + 11) + L = 35 \)

Simplifying this equation:

\( 2L + 11 = 35 \)

\( 2L = 24 \)

\( L = 12 \)

Now we can substitute \( L \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):

\( C = 12 + 11 \)

\( C = 23 \)

Therefore, the Chrysler Building has 23 floors.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of floors in the Leeward Center as \( L \). According to the problem, the Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center, so the number of floors in the Chrysler Building is \( L + 11 \).

The total number of floors in both buildings is given as 35. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 11) = 35 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2L + 11 = 35 \]

Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2L = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 12 \]

Now that we know the number of floors in the Leeward Center is 12, we can find the number of floors in the Chrysler Building by adding 11 to the number of floors in the Leeward Center:
\[ \text{Number of floors in the Chrysler Building} = 12 + 11 = 23 \]

So, the Chrysler Building has 23 floors.

Let's denote the number of floors in the Chrysler Building as \( C \) and the number of floors in the Leeward Center as \( L \).

From the information given, we know two things:
1. The Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center: \( C = L + 11 \).
2. Together they have a total of 35 floors: \( C + L = 35 \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 11) + L = 35 \]
\[ 2L + 11 = 35 \]
\[ 2L = 35 - 11 \]
\[ 2L = 24 \]
\[ L = 12 \]

Now that we know the Leeward Center has 12 floors, we can find the number of floors in the Chrysler Building using the first equation:
\[ C = L + 11 \]
\[ C = 12 + 11 \]
\[ C = 23 \]

So, the Chrysler Building has 23 floors.

Let's denote the number of floors in the Leeward Center as \( L \). According to the problem, the Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center, so the number of floors in the Chrysler Building is \( L + 11 \).

Together, they have a total of 35 floors. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 11) = 35 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 2L + 11 = 35 \]

Subtract 11 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 24 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ L = 12 \]

The Leeward Center has 12 floors. The Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center, so:
\[ 12 + 11 = 23 \]

Therefore, the Chrysler Building has 23 floors.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of floors of the Leeward Center as L and the number of floors of the Chrysler Building as C. According to the problem, we have:

1) C = L + 11 (The Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center)
2) C + L = 35 (Together they have a total of 35 floors)

From equation (2), we can substitute C in equation (1) with L + 11, leading to:

L + 11 + L = 35
2L + 11 = 35
2L = 24
L = 12

Now we know the number of floors of the Leeward Center is 12. By substituting L back in either equation, we can find the number of floors of the Chrysler Building:

C = L + 11 = 12 + 11 = 23

So, the Chrysler Building has 23 floors.

Let's denote the number of floors in the Leeward Center as \( L \) and the number of floors in the Chrysler Building as \( C \).

According to the problem, the Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center:

It is also given that the total number of floors in both buildings is 35:
\[ C + L = 35 \]

Substituting \( C = L + 11 \) into the second equation, we get:

Let's denote the number of floors in the Leeward Center as \( x \). According to the problem, the Chrysler Building has \( x + 11 \) floors. The total number of floors in both buildings is 35. We can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 11) = 35 \]

\[ 2x + 11 = 35 \]

Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of floors in the Chrysler Building as \( C \) and the number of floors in the Leeward Center as \( L \). According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. \( C = L + 11 \) (The Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center)
2. \( C + L = 35 \) (Together, they have a total of 35 floors)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Solving for \( L \):

\( 2L + 11 = 35 \)

Subtract 11 from both sides:

Divide by 2:

\( L = 12 \)

Now that we know the Leeward Center has 12 floors, we can find the number of floors in the Chrysler Building by adding 11 to \( L \):

\( C = 12 + 11 \)

\( C = 23 \)

Therefore, the Chrysler Building has 23 floors.

Let's denote the number of floors in the Chrysler Building as \( C \) and the number of floors in the Leeward Center as \( L \).

From the given information, we have two pieces of information:
1. The Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center: \( C = L + 11 \).
2. Together the two buildings have a total of 35 floors: \( C + L = 35 \).

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\( (C + 11) + C = 35 \)

Simplifying this, we get:

\( 2C + 11 = 35 \)

Subtracting 11 from both sides:

\( 2C = 24 \)

Dividing by 2:

\( C = 12 \)

So the Chrysler Building has 12 floors.

Therefore, \( L = C - 11 = 12 - 11 = 1 \).
