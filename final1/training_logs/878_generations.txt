<reasoning>
The front wheel has 20 spokes. The back wheel has twice as many spokes, which means it has 20 x 2 = 40 spokes. To find the total number of spokes, we add the spokes on the front wheel to the spokes on the back wheel: 20 + 40 = 60 spokes.

The front wheel of the bicycle has 20 spokes. The back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel, which means the back wheel has 20 * 2 = 40 spokes. The total number of spokes on the bicycle is the sum of the spokes on the front and back wheels, which is 20 + 40 = 60. Therefore, the bicycle has 60 spokes in total.

First, let's find out how many spokes are on the back wheel. The front wheel has 20 spokes, and the back wheel has twice as many, which means there are 20 * 2 = 40 spokes on the back wheel.

Now, to find the total number of spokes on the bicycle, we add the number of spokes on the front wheel to the number of spokes on the back wheel, so 20 + 40 = 60.

Therefore, the bicycle has 60 spokes in total.

To find the total number of spokes on the bicycle, we need to first determine the number of spokes on the back wheel. Since the back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel, which has 20 spokes, the back wheel has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) spokes.

Next, we add the number of spokes on the front wheel to the number of spokes on the back wheel to get the total number of spokes on the bicycle. So, the total number of spokes is \(20 + 40 = 60\).

The front wheel has 20 spokes. The back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel, which means it has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) spokes.

To find the total number of spokes on the bicycle, we add the number of spokes on both wheels: 
\[ 20 \text{ (front wheel)} + 40 \text{ (back wheel)} = 60 \text{ spokes} \]

Therefore, the bicycle has 60 spokes in total.

To find the total number of spokes on the bicycle, we need to start with the number of spokes on the front wheel. The front wheel has 20 spokes. Since the back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel, we can calculate the number of spokes on the back wheel as follows:
\[ \text{Number of spokes on the back wheel} = 2 \times 20 \]

Next, we add the number of spokes on the front wheel to the number of spokes on the back wheel to find the total number of spokes on the bicycle:
\[ \text{Total number of spokes} = \text{Number of spokes on the front wheel} + \text{Number of spokes on the back wheel} \]

Now let's do the calculation:
\[ \text{Total number of spokes} = 20 + (2 \times 20) = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of spokes on the bicycle is:
\[ 60 \]

To determine the total number of spokes on the bicycle, we need to calculate the number of spokes on each wheel and then sum them up.

1. The front wheel has 20 spokes.
2. The back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel. Therefore, the number of spokes on the back wheel is \(2 \times 20 = 40\).

Now, we add the number of spokes on both wheels to get the total number of spokes:
\[
20 \text{ (front wheel)} + 40 \text{ (back wheel)} = 60 \text{ spokes}
\]

Therefore, the bicycle has a total of 60 spokes.

First, let's calculate the number of spokes on the back wheel. Since the back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel, we can multiply the number of spokes on the front wheel by 2.

Spokes on the front wheel = 20
Spokes on the back wheel = 20 spokes * 2 = 40 spokes

Now, let's add the number of spokes on the front wheel and the back wheel to find the total number of spokes on the bicycle.

Total spokes = Spokes on the front wheel + Spokes on the back wheel
Total spokes = 20 spokes + 40 spokes = 60 spokes

The problem states that the bicycle has 20 spokes on the front wheel and twice as many spokes on the back wheel as the front wheel. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of spokes on the back wheel first. Since the back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel, it will have \(20 \times 2 = 40\) spokes.

Next, we add the number of spokes on the front wheel and the number of spokes on the back wheel to find the total number of spokes on the bicycle. So, the total number of spokes is \(20 + 40 = 60\).

Therefore, the bicycle has a total of 60 spokes.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of spokes on the front wheel as \( F \) and the number of spokes on the back wheel as \( B \). According to the problem, the front wheel has 20 spokes, so \( F = 20 \). The back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel, so \( B = 2 \times 20 \). 

To find the total number of spokes on the bicycle, we need to add the number of spokes on the front wheel and the back wheel together: \( F + B \).

Substituting the values we found, we get:
\[ F + B = 20 + 2 \times 20 \]
\[ F + B = 20 + 40 \]
\[ F + B = 60 \]

So, the total number of spokes on the bicycle is 60.
