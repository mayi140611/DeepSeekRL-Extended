The hotel rooms can fit 2 students per bed and 1 student per couch for a total of 3 students per room. So the principal needs to book 30 students / 3 students per room = 10 rooms.

To determine the number of rooms needed, we first calculate the total capacity of each room. Each room has:

- 2 queen size beds, each fitting 2 students: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) students
- 1 pull-out couch, which can fit 1 student: \(1 \times 1 = 1\) student

Adding these together, each room can fit: \(4 + 1 = 5\) students.

The class has 30 students in total. To find out how many rooms are needed, we divide the total number of students by the capacity of each room and round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't have a fraction of a room and you need to fit all students).

\[
\frac{30}{5} = 6
\]

Since \(30 \div 5 = 6\) with no remainder, 6 rooms are sufficient to accommodate all 30 students.

Each room can fit 2 x 2 = 4 students because each queen-sized bed can fit 2 students.
The principal needs to book 30 / 4 = 7.5 rooms.
Since rooms cannot be half-booked, the principal needs to book 8 rooms.

If each room has two queen size beds which can fit two students each, that means that a room can hold $2 \times 2 = 4$ students.

However, each room also has a pull-out couch which can hold one student.  Therefore, a room can hold a total of $4 + 1 = 5$ students.

Since the class has 30 students, the principal needs to book $\dfrac{30}{5} = 6$ rooms in order to fit all 30 students in the class.

Each hotel room can fit 2x2=4 students when both beds are occupied and 4+1=5 students when the pull-out couch is occupied.

If we let x be the number of rooms the principal need to book to fit all of the students in the class, then the equation is: 5x=30.

Thus the principal needs to book 30/5=6 rooms to fit all of the students in the class.

The principal needs to book enough rooms to accommodate the 30 students. Each room can fit 3 students (2 rooms with 2 students each per room, and 1 pull-out couch to fit 1 student).  
So 30 / 3 = 10 rooms are needed.

To determine how many rooms the principal needs to book, we first calculate the total number of students that can be accommodated by each room. Each room has two queen size beds that can fit two students each, and a pull-out couch that can fit one student. Therefore, the total number of students that each room can accommodate is:

\[2 \text{ (from the beds)} + 1 \text{ (from the couch)} = 3 \text{ students per room}\]

The school principal needs to fit 30 students. To find out how many rooms are required, we divide the total number of students by the number of students that can be accommodated by each room:

\[30 \div 3 = 10\]

Since 30 divided by 3 equals exactly 10, the principal needs to book 10 rooms to fit all of the students.

To determine the number of rooms the principal needs to book, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one room.

Each room has:
- Two queen size beds, each capable of housing one student, which gives us \(2 \times 1 = 2\) students.
- One pull-out couch, which can house one student.

Therefore, the total capacity of one room is \(2 + 1 = 3\) students.

Given that there are 30 students and each room can host 3 students, we divide the total number of students by the capacity of one room to find the number of rooms needed:

\[
\text{Number of rooms} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Capacity per room}} = \frac{30}{3} = 10
\]

Thus, the principal needs to book 10 rooms to fit all of the students in the class.

To determine how many rooms the principal needs to book, we need to calculate the total number of students that can be accommodated in one room. Each room has two queen size beds, which can fit two students each, and one pull-out couch, which can fit one student. Therefore, the total number of students that can be accommodated in one room is:

\[ 2 \text{ (beds)} + 2 \text{ (students)} + 1 \text{ (couch)} = 5 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rooms are required to accommodate 30 students. Since each room can fit 5 students, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per room:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ students}}{5 \text{ students/room}} = 6 \text{ rooms} \]

Thus, the principal needs to book \(\boxed{6}\) rooms to fit all of the students in the class.
