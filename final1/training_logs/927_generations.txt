First, we determine how many cards Malcom initially has. Since Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon, we calculate:
\[ \text{Malcom's cards} = \text{Brandon's cards} + 8 = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Next, Malcom gives half of his cards to his friend Mark. To find out how many cards Malcom gives away, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cards given away} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Malcom's initial cards} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \]

Finally, to find how many cards Malcom has left, we subtract the number of cards given away from his initial number of cards:
\[ \text{Cards Malcom has left} = \text{Malcom's initial cards} - \text{Cards given away} = 28 - 14 = 14 \]

So, Malcom has 14 cards left.

To determine how many baseball cards Malcom has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the number of cards Malcom initially has:**
   Brandon has 20 cards. Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon.
   \[
   \text{Cards Malcom has initially} = 20 + 8 = 28
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cards Malcom gives to Mark:**
   Malcom gives half of his cards to Mark.
   \[
   \text{Cards Malcom gives to Mark} = \frac{28}{2} = 14
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cards Malcom has left after giving to Mark:**
   \[
   \text{Cards Malcom has left} = 28 - 14 = 14
   \]

So, after giving half of his cards to Mark, Malcom has 14 cards left.

First, let's determine how many cards Malcom has initially. Since Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon, we add 8 to Brandon's 20 cards:

Malcom's cards = 20 (Brandon's cards) + 8 = 28 cards

Next, Malcom gives half of his cards to Mark. Half of Malcomâ€™s cards is:

Half = \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \)

So, Malcom gives 14 cards to Mark. To find out how many cards Malcom has left, we subtract the 14 cards he gave to Mark from his initial 28 cards:

Cards left = 28 (initial) - 14 (given to Mark) = 14 cards

Therefore, Malcom has 14 cards left.

To determine how many cards Malcom has left, we first need to find out how many cards he originally has. Since Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon, and Brandon has 20 cards, Malcom has \(20 + 8 = 28\) cards initially.

Next, we need to account for the fact that Malcom gives half of his cards to Mark. Therefore, Malcom gives away \(28 / 2 = 14\) cards.

Subtracting the number of cards given away from the initial number of cards, Malcom is left with \(28 - 14 = 14\) cards.

To determine how many baseball cards Malcom has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cards Malcom initially has.
2. Determine how many cards Malcom gives to Mark.
3. Subtract the number of cards given to Mark from the initial number of cards Malcom had.

Step 1: Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon.
Since Brandon has 20 cards, we calculate:
\[ \text{Malcom's initial cards} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Step 2: Malcom gives half of his cards to Mark.
Since Malcom initially has 28 cards, half of that is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of cards given to Mark from Malcom's initial total.
\[ \text{Malcom's remaining cards} = 28 - 14 = 14 \]

Thus, Malcom has 14 cards left.

To determine how many baseball cards Malcom has left, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cards Malcom initially has.
2. Determine how many cards Malcom gives to Mark.
3. Subtract the number of cards given to Mark from the initial amount to find out how many cards Malcom has left.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cards Malcom initially has.
Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon. Since Brandon has 20 cards, we calculate:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \]
So, Malcom initially has 28 cards.

Step 2: Determine how many cards Malcom gives to Mark.
Malcom gives half of his cards to his friend Mark. To find out how many cards this is, we calculate:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]
So, Malcom gives 14 cards to Mark.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cards given to Mark from the initial amount to find out how many cards Malcom has left.
\[ 28 - 14 = 14 \]
So, Malcom has 14 cards left.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Find how many cards Malcom has initially. Since Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon, we calculate Malcom's cards as:
   Malcom's cards = Brandon's cards + 8
   Malcom's cards = 20 + 8
   Malcom's cards = 28

2. Malcom then gives half of his cards to his friend Mark. So, we calculate how many cards Malcom gives to Mark as:
   Cards given to Mark = Malcom's cards / 2
   Cards given to Mark = 28 / 2
   Cards given to Mark = 14

3. To find how many cards Malcom has left, we subtract the number of cards given to Mark from the total number of cards Malcom had initially:
   Malcom's remaining cards = Malcom's cards - Cards given to Mark
   Malcom's remaining cards = 28 - 14
   Malcom's remaining cards = 14

Thus, by following these steps, we find that Malcom has 14 cards left.
