###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Three adults whose average weight is 140 pounds went first in the elevator. Two children whose average weight is 64 pounds also went inside. If an elevator sign reads â€œMaximum weight 600 pounds.", what is the maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator so that it will not be overloaded?

To determine the maximum weight of the next person that can enter the elevator without exceeding the maximum weight limit of 600 pounds, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the three adults:**
   - Average weight of one adult = 140 pounds
   - Number of adults = 3
   - Total weight of the adults = \( 140 \times 3 = 420 \) pounds

2. **Calculate the total weight of the two children:**
   - Average weight of one child = 64 pounds
   - Number of children = 2
   - Total weight of the children = \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \) pounds

3. **Calculate the combined total weight of the adults and children:**
   - Total weight of adults = 420 pounds
   - Total weight of children = 128 pounds
   - Combined total weight = \( 420 + 128 = 548 \) pounds

4. **Subtract the combined total weight from the maximum elevator weight limit:**
   - Maximum elevator weight limit = 600 pounds
   - Maximum weight of the next person = \( 600 - 548 = 52 \) pounds

Therefore, the maximum weight of the next person that can enter the elevator without exceeding the maximum weight limit is 52 pounds.

To find the total weight of the three adults, we multiply their average weight by the number of adults:

\[ \text{Total weight of adults} = 140 \, \text{pounds} \times 3 = 420 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the two children:

\[ \text{Total weight of children} = 64 \, \text{pounds} \times 2 = 128 \, \text{pounds} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the adults and children to find the total weight they weigh together:

\[ \text{Total weight of adults and children} = 420 \, \text{pounds} + 128 \, \text{pounds} = 548 \, \text{pounds} \]

The elevator's maximum weight is 600 pounds, so to avoid overload, the next person's weight should be:

\[ \text{Maximum weight of the next person} = 600 \, \text{pounds} - 548 \, \text{pounds} = 52 \, \text{pounds} \]

To find the maximum weight of the next person to avoid overloading the elevator, let's follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the three adults.
2. Calculate the total weight of the two children.
3. Add these weights together to get the initial weight limit.
4. Subtract this total from the maximum weight limit to find the maximum weight of the next person.
5. Round down the result to the nearest whole number to ensure the elevator does not exceed its maximum capacity.

Let's compute these:

1. The total weight of the three adults:
   \( 3 \times 140 \) pounds = 420 pounds.

2. The total weight of the two children:
   \( 2 \times 64 \) pounds = 128 pounds.

3. The initial total weight:
   \( 420 + 128 = 548 \) pounds.

4. The maximum weight limit of the elevator is 600 pounds, so we subtract the initial total weight from this limit:
   \( 600 - 548 = 52 \) pounds.

5. Since we need to round down to the nearest whole number, the maximum weight of the next person can be 52 pounds.

The total weight of the three adults is \(3 \times 140 = 420\) pounds. The total weight of the two children is \(2 \times 64 = 128\) pounds. Therefore, the total weight currently inside the elevator is \(420 + 128 = 548\) pounds. The elevator can carry a maximum of 600 pounds, so the weight of the next person must be \(600 - 548 = 52\) pounds.

To determine the maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator, we need to first calculate the total weight of the three adults and the two children, and then find how much more weight the elevator can handle before it reaches the maximum weight limit of 600 pounds.

1. Calculate the total weight of the three adults:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of adults} = 3 \times 140 = 420 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Calculate the total weight of the two children:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of children} = 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Add the total weights of the adults and the children to find the current total weight in the elevator:
   \[
   \text{Current total weight} = 420 + 128 = 548 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Determine how much more weight the elevator can handle before it reaches the maximum weight limit of 600 pounds:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 600 - 548 = 52 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. Since this is the maximum weight that can be added to the elevator without exceeding the limit, the maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator is:

Since we know the total weight of the adults (which is 140 * 3 = 420 pounds), the weight of the children is 64 * 2 = 128 pounds.

The total weight of the current passengers is 420 + 128 = 548 pounds.

The maximum weight the elevator can hold is 600 pounds.

To find the maximum weight of the next person, we subtract the current total weight of the passengers from the maximum weight limit.

So, 600 - 548 = 52 pounds.

To find the maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator without overloading it, we need to first calculate the total weight of the three adults and the two children who have already entered.

1. Calculate the total weight of the three adults:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of adults} = 3 \times 140 = 420 \text{ pounds}

2. Calculate the total weight of the two children:

4. The elevator can hold a maximum weight of 600 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the next person should be less than or equal to the remaining capacity of the elevator.

5. Calculate the remaining capacity of the elevator:
   \[

To ensure the elevator does not exceed its maximum weight of 600 pounds, we subtract the total weight of the existing passengers from the elevator's maximum capacity:
\[
600 \text{ pounds} - (3 \times 140 \text{ pounds} + 2 \times 64 \text{ pounds}) = 600 - 548 = 52 \text{ pounds}

To find the maximum weight of the next person that can get in without overloading the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the adults, the children, and then subtract that from the maximum weight capacity of the elevator.

First, calculate the total weight of the adults:
\[ \text{Total weight of adults} = 3 \times 140 \text{ pounds} = 420 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the total weight of the children:
\[ \text{Total weight of children} = 2 \times 64 \text{ pounds} = 128 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the total weight of the adults and the children:
\[ \text{Total weight of adults and children} = 420 \text{ pounds} + 128 \text{ pounds} = 548 \text{ pounds} \]

The maximum weight capacity of the elevator is 600 pounds. To find the maximum weight of the next person, subtract the total weight of the adults and children from the maximum capacity:
\[ \text{Maximum weight of the next person} = 600 \text{ pounds} - 548 \text{ pounds} = 52 \text{ pounds} \]
