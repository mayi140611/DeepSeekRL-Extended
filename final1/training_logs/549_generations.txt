Initially, Randy had $3,000. Smith gave him an additional $200, so Randy's total became $3,000 + $200 = $3,200. Then, Randy gave $1,200 to Sally, so the amount Randy kept is $3,200 - $1,200 = $2,000.

Initially, Randy had $3,000. Smith gave him an additional $200, so Randy's total became:
\[ 3000 + 200 = 3200 \text{ dollars} \]

Randy then gave Sally $1,200, so the amount he kept is:
\[ 3200 - 1200 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the value of the rest is $2,000.

Randy initially had $3,000. After Smith gave him $200, the total amount Randy had became $3,000 + $200 = $3,200.

system
Randy initially had $3,000 and Smith gave him an additional $200. So, the total amount Randy had after receiving money from Smith is:
\[ 3000 + 200 = 3200 \text{ dollars} \]

Randy then gave Sally $1,200. To find out how much he kept, we subtract the amount given to Sally from the total amount Randy had:
\[ 3200 - 1200 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the value of the rest is $2000.

Randy had $3,000. Smith gave him another $200. So Randy now has:

\[ 3000 + 200 = 3200 \text{ dollars} \]

Randy then gave Sally $1,200. After giving Sally $1,200, Randy has:

\[ 3200 - 1200 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

So the value of the rest, which is the amount Randy kept, is:

2000 dollars
