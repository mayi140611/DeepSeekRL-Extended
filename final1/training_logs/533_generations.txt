#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote Claire's current age as \( C \) and Jessica's current age as \( J \).

According to the information given:
1. Jessica is six years older than Claire, so \( J = C + 6 \).
2. In two years, Claire will be 20 years old. This means \( C + 2 = 20 \), which we can solve for \( C \) to find Claire's current age.

From the second point, we can calculate Claire's current age:
\[ C + 2 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 2 \]
\[ C = 18 \]

Now that we know Claire's current age is 18, we can find Jessica's current age using equation 1:
\[ J = C + 6 \]
\[ J = 18 + 6 \]
\[ J = 24 \]

Jessica is currently 24 years old.

Let's reason through this step by step:

1. We know that in two years, Claire will be 20 years old.
2. Therefore, Claire's current age is 20 - 2 = 18 years old.
3. Jessica is six years older than Claire.
4. So, if Claire is 18 years old, then Jessica is 18 + 6 = 24 years old.

Now let's write this in a way that answers the question directly.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote Claire's current age as \( C \).

Given that in two years Claire will be 20 years old, we can write:
\[ C + 2 = 20 \]

From this equation, we can solve for Claire's current age:
\[ C = 20 - 2 \]
\[ C = 18 \]

Now, we know that Jessica is six years older than Claire. So Jessica's current age can be calculated as:
\[ J = C + 6 \]
\[ J = 18 + 6 \]
\[ J = 24 \]

Thus, Jessica is currently 24 years old.

To determine Jessica's current age, let's break down the information given:

1. In two years, Claire will be 20 years old.
2. This means Claire is currently 18 years old (20 - 2).
3. Jessica is six years older than Claire.
4. Therefore, Jessica is 18 + 6 = 24 years old.

So, Jessica is currently 24 years old.

Let's denote Claire's current age as \( C \) and Jessica's current age as \( J \). According to the information given:

1. Jessica is six years older than Claire, so \( J = C + 6 \).
2. In two years, Claire will be 20 years old, so \( C + 2 = 20 \).

We can solve the equation \( C + 2 = 20 \) to find Claire's current age:

\[ C = 20 - 2 = 18 \]

Now that we know Claire's current age is 18, we can calculate Jessica's current age using the first equation:

\[ J = C + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \]

So, Jessica is currently 24 years old.

#### GENERATION 8 RESPONSE ####

system
To determine Jessica's current age, we start by determining Claire's current age.

Given that in two years, Claire will be 20 years old, we can find Claire's current age by subtracting 2 years from 20:

\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \]

So, Claire is currently 18 years old.

Next, we are told that Jessica is six years older than Claire. Therefore, we can find Jessica's current age by adding 6 years to Claire's current age:

\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \]

Thus, Jessica is currently 24 years old.

Now, we can summarize the reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning:**
1. In two years, Claire will be 20 years old.
2. To find Claire's current age, we subtract 2 from 20, resulting in 18 years old.
3. Jessica is six years older than Claire, so her current age is 18 + 6 = 24 years old.

**Answer:**
Jessica is currently 24 years old.

\[ \boxed{24} \]

To determine Jessica's current age, we need to first determine Claire's current age and then calculate Jessica's age based on the given relationship.

1. We know that in two years, Claire will be 20 years old. Therefore, her current age is:
   \[
   20 - 2 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. We also know that Jessica is six years older than Claire. So, we add 6 years to Claire's current age to find Jessica's current age:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

So, Jessica is currently 24 years old.
