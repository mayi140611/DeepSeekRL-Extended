system
To determine how much John has to pay for the hearing aids after insurance covers 80% of the cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the two hearing aids.
   - Each hearing aid costs $2500.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(2500 \times 2 = 5000\) dollars.

2. Determine the amount covered by insurance.
   - Insurance covers 80% of the total cost.
   - So, the amount covered by insurance is \(5000 \times 0.80 = 4000\) dollars.

3. Calculate the amount John has to pay out of pocket.
   - The amount John has to pay is the total cost minus the amount covered by insurance.
   - Therefore, the amount paid by John is \(5000 - 4000 = 1000\) dollars.

First, calculate the total cost of both hearing aids:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2 \times 2500 = 5000 \]

Next, determine how much insurance covers:
\[ \text{Insurance Coverage} = 5000 \times 0.80 = 4000 \]

Finally, subtract the insurance coverage from the total cost to find out how much John has to personally pay:
\[ \text{Personal Payment} = 5000 - 4000 = 1000 \]

To find out how much John personally pays, we need to calculate the total cost of the hearing aids and then determine how much his insurance covers. Finally, we subtract the covered amount from the total cost to find out what John has to pay.

1. Calculate the total cost of the hearing aids:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 \times \$2500 = \$5000
   \]

2. Calculate the insurance coverage:
   \[
   \text{Insurance coverage} = 80\% \times \$5000 = 0.8 \times \$5000 = \$4000
   \]

3. Calculate the amount John personally has to pay:
   \[
   \text{John's payment} = \$5000 - \$4000 = \$1000
   \]

Answer: John personally has to pay $1000.

To calculate how much John has to personally pay for the hearing aids, we first need to determine the total cost before insurance coverage and then find out how much insurance covers and how much John is responsible.

The cost of one hearing aid is $2500, so for two hearing aids, the total cost is:
\[ 2500 \times 2 = 5000 \text{ dollars} \]

Insurance covers 80% of the cost, so the amount covered by insurance is:
\[ 5000 \times 0.80 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount John has to pay out-of-pocket is the total cost minus the amount covered by insurance:
\[ 5000 - 4000 = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John personally has to pay:

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The cost of one hearing aid is $2500.
2. John needs to replace both hearing aids, so the total cost is:
   2 × $2500 = $5000.

3. Insurance covers 80% of this total cost, so John is responsible for the remaining 20%.

4. To find out how much John personally has to pay, we calculate 20% of the total cost:
   0.20 × $5000 = $1000.

So, John personally has to pay $1000.

To calculate how much John personally has to pay, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of replacing both hearing aids:
   The cost of one hearing aid is $2500, so the total cost for two is:
   $2500 * 2 = $5000

2. Determine the insurance coverage:
   Insurance covers 80% of the cost. This means John pays 20% of the total cost.

3. Calculate the amount John has to pay out of pocket:
   The 20% that John has to pay can be found by subtracting the insurance coverage from the total cost:
   $5000 * (1 - 0.80) = $5000 * 0.20 = $1000

So, John personally has to pay $1000.

To find out how much John has to pay, we need to first calculate the total cost of replacing both hearing aids. Since each hearing aid costs $2500, the total cost would be:

\[2500 \times 2 = 5000\]

This is the amount John would have to pay out of pocket. However, insurance covers 80% of this cost, so he only has to pay 20%. To find out how much he pays, we calculate 20% of $5000:

This means that insurance will cover $4000 out of the total cost. To find out how much John has to pay out of pocket, we subtract what insurance covers from the total cost:

The total cost of the hearing aids is $2500 each for 2, which is $2500 * 2 = $5000.

Insurance covers 80% of the cost, so it covers 80/100 * $5000 = $4000.

The amount John has to pay is the total cost minus what the insurance covers, which is $5000 - $4000 = $1000.

To find out how much John personally has to pay, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of one hearing aid because his insurance covers 80% of the cost, leaving 20% for John to pay. 

Each hearing aid costs $2500.

\[20\% \text{ of } \$2500 = \frac{20}{100} \times 2500 = 0.2 \times 2500 = \$500\]

So, John needs to pay $500 for one hearing aid.

Since he needs to replace both hearing aids, we multiply the cost per hearing aid by 2:

\[500 \times 2 = \$1000\]

Therefore, John personally has to pay $1000.

To find out how much John personally has to pay for the hearing aids, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of both hearing aids without insurance.
2. Calculate the amount covered by insurance.
3. Subtract the amount covered by insurance from the total cost to find out how much John personally has to pay.

Given:
- Cost of each hearing aid = $2500
- Total number of hearing aids = 2
- Insurance coverage = 80%

Step 1: Calculate the total cost without insurance.
\[ \text{Total cost without insurance} = 2500 \times 2 = 5000 \]

Step 2: Calculate the amount covered by insurance.
\[ \text{Amount covered by insurance} = 5000 \times 0.80 = 4000 \]

Step 3: Calculate the amount John personally has to pay.
\[ \text{Amount John has to pay} = 5000 - 4000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, John personally has to pay $1000.

To calculate how much John personally has to pay, we first need to determine the total cost of the hearing aids before insurance coverage.

Cost per hearing aid: $2500
Total cost for both hearing aids: $2500 * 2 = $5000

Insurance covers 80% of the cost, so John has to pay 20% out of pocket.

Out-of-pocket percentage: 100% - 80% = 20%
