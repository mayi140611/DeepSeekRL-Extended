To calculate the selling price that includes a 15% profit, first calculate 15% of the cost price.

15% of $3000 = 0.15 * $3000 = $450

Then add the profit to the cost price to find the selling price.

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
Selling price = $3000 + $450 = $3450

So, the reseller should sell the bag for $3450.

To calculate the reseller's selling price with a 15% profit, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage}) \]

Given:
- Cost Price (\(CP\)) = $3000
- Profit Percentage = 15% = \( \frac{15}{100} = 0.15 \)

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \$3000 + ( \$3000 \times 0.15 ) \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \$3000 + \$450 \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \$3450 \]

So, the reseller should sell the bag for $3450 to make a 15% profit.

To calculate the selling price that includes a 15% profit, we first need to calculate the amount of profit the reseller wants to make. The profit can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the profit percentage.

Profit = Cost Price × Profit Percentage

Profit = $3000 × 15% = $3000 × 0.15 = $450

Now, the total selling price that includes the reseller's desired profit is the sum of the cost price and the profit.

Total Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit

Total Selling Price = $3000 + $450 = $3450

So, to make a 15% profit, the reseller should sell the bag for $3450.

To calculate the selling price that includes a 15% profit, we multiply the original cost by (1 + profit percentage). Therefore the selling price is $3000 * (1 + 0.15) = $3450.

system
To calculate the selling price that would give the reseller a 15% profit, we first need to calculate the cost that would provide a 15% profit margin on the original price of $3000.

The profit margin can be calculated as 15% of the original price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Profit Margin} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$3000 \times 0.15 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$450 \]

Next, we add this profit to the original price to get the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Original Price} + \text{Profit} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \$3000 + \$450 = \$3450 \]

So, the reseller should sell the bag for $3450 to achieve a 15% profit.

To calculate the sale price that would give a 15% profit, we first determine 15% of the original price and then add that amount to the original price.

15% of $3000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.15 \times 3000 = 450 \]

So, a 15% profit means selling at a price that includes both the original price and the profit:
\[ 3000 + 450 = 3450 \]

Therefore, the reseller should sell the bag for $3450.

First, the reseller needs to know how much money the bag is worth on the high end. The high end is $3000 (list price). Now find 15% of $3000.

15% of $3000:
0.15 * $3000 = $450

Add that amount to the list price.
$3000 + $450 = $3450

So, the reseller should sell the bag for $3450 to get a 15% profit.

To determine the selling price for a 15% profit, you can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the profit amount**: To find out the amount that would give a 15% profit, you multiply the cost price by the profit percentage.
   \[
   \text{Profit Amount} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage}
   \]
   Given:
   \[
   \text{Cost Price} = \$3000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = 15\%
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit Amount} = \$3000 \times \frac{15}{100} = \$3000 \times 0.15 = \$450
   \]

2. **Calculate the selling price**: The selling price is the sum of the cost price and the profit amount.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit Amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$3000 + \$450 = \$3450
   \]

**Final Answer:** The reseller should sell the bag for $3450 to achieve a 15% profit.

To calculate the selling price that includes a 15% profit, we first find out what 15% of the bag's cost is, and then add that to the original price of the bag.

The profit amount is:
\( 15\% \times $3000 = \frac{15}{100} \times $3000 = $450 \)

The total selling price should include the original price plus the profit:
\( $3000 + $450 = $3450 \)

So, the reseller should sell the bag for $3450 to get a 15% profit.

To calculate the selling price to achieve a 15% profit, we first need to find the profit amount based on the cost of the bag. The cost of the bag is $3000.

The profit amount can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit Amount} = \text{Cost} \times \text{Profit Percentage} \]
\[ \text{Profit Amount} = \$3000 \times 0.15 \]
\[ \text{Profit Amount} = \$450 \]

Now, to find the total selling price, we add the profit amount to the original cost:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost} + \text{Profit Amount} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \$3000 + \$450 \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \$3450 \]

So, the reseller should sell the bag for $3450 to achieve a 15% profit.
