###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

There is a 5,200 sq. ft. house and a 7,300 sq. ft. house next to each other. The smaller house is being expanded. If the new total square footage of both houses is 16,000 sq. ft., how much is the smaller house being expanded by, in sq. ft.?

To determine how much the smaller house is being expanded by, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's denote the area of the smaller house as \( x \) sq. ft.
2. The area of the larger house is given as 7,300 sq. ft.
3. The total square footage of both houses after the expansion is 16,000 sq. ft.

We can set up the equation:
\[
x + 7300 = 16000
\]

4. Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 16000 - 7300 = 8700
\]

So, the smaller house was originally 8,700 sq. ft. Now, let's find out how much it has been expanded.

5. Calculate the expansion amount:
\[
8700 - 7300 = 1400
\]

Thus, the smaller house is being expanded by 1,400 sq. ft.

Let's denote the increase in the smaller house's square footage as \( x \) square feet. Initially, the smaller house is 5,200 sq. ft., and after expansion, it becomes \( 5200 + x \) sq. ft. The larger house remains at 7,300 sq. ft. The total square footage of both houses after the expansion is 16,000 sq. ft.

We can set up the following equation:

\[ 5200 + x + 7300 = 16000 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 5200 + x + 7300 = 16000 \]
\[ 12500 + x = 16000 \]
\[ x = 16000 - 12500 \]
\[ x = 3500 \]

Therefore, the smaller house is being expanded by 3500 square feet.

Let's denote the expansion of the smaller house as \( x \). The original square footage of the smaller house is 5,200 sq. ft., and after the expansion it becomes \( 5200 + x \) sq. ft. The larger house, originally 7,300 sq. ft., remains unaltered, so it's still 7,300 sq. ft. The total square footage of both houses after the expansion is given as 16,000 sq. ft. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 5200 + x + 7300 = 16000 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 12500 + x = 16000 \]
\[ x = 16000 - 12500 \]
\[ x = 3500 \]

So, the smaller house is being expanded by 3500 sq. ft.

Let's denote the expanded area of the smaller house as \( x \). The original area of the smaller house is 5,200 sq. ft., so the expanded area of the smaller house is \( 5,200 + x \) sq. ft.

The original area of the larger house is 7,300 sq. ft., and the new total area of both houses together is 16,000 sq. ft. So, the area of the larger house after expansion is 7,300 + \( x \) sq. ft.

The equation representing the total area is:
\[ 5,200 + x + 7,300 + x = 16,000 \]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 12,500 + 2x = 16,000 \]
Subtract 12,500 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 3,500 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ x = 1,750 \]

So, the smaller house is being expanded by 1,750 sq. ft.

Let's denote the expansion of the smaller house by \( x \) square feet.

The original square footage of the smaller house is 5,200 sq. ft., and after expansion, it becomes \( 5200 + x \) sq. ft.
The original square footage of the larger house is 7,300 sq. ft., and since the total square footage of both houses after expansion is 16,000 sq. ft., the square footage of the larger house after expansion is \( 16000 - (5200 + x) = 10800 - x \) sq. ft.

According to the problem, the square footage of the larger house after expansion is 7,300 + \( x \) sq. ft., which is equal to \( 10800 - x \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 10800 - x = 7300 + x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 10800 - 7300 = x + x \]
\[ 3500 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{3500}{2} \]
\[ x = 1750 \]

Therefore, the smaller house is being expanded by 1750 sq. ft.

Let's denote the amount the smaller house (5,200 sq. ft.) is being expanded by as \( x \) square feet.

The total expansion of the smaller house would be \( x \) square feet, and the total expansion of the larger house would be \( 16,000 - 5,200 \) square feet, because the total square footage of both houses combined is 16,000 sq. ft. and the original total is 7,300 sq. ft. for the larger house.

So, the equation we can set up is:
\[ 5,200 + x = 16,000 - (7,300 - x) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 5,200 + x = 8,700 + x \]

Now, subtract \( x \) from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ 5,200 = 8,700 \]

This equation doesn't seem correct as it suggests no expansion, so let's use the correct approach by directly solving for \( x \) in the correct equation:

\[ 5,200 + x = 16,000 - 7,300 \]

\[ 5,200 + x = 8,700 \]

Subtract 5,200 from both sides:
\[ x = 8,700 - 5,200 \]

\[ x = 3,500 \]

The smaller house is being expanded by 3,500 square feet.

Let X be the amount the smaller house is being expanded by in sq. ft.

Now, the new total square footage of both houses is 16,000 sq. ft. So, the expansion of the smaller house is 16,000 - 7,300 = 8,700 sq. ft.

Thus, the amount the smaller house is being expanded by in sq. ft. is 8,700 sq. ft.

To solve this problem, let's denote the size of the smaller house as \( S \) sq. ft. Since the total square footage of both houses is given as 16,000 sq. ft., and the larger house already has a square footage of 7,300 sq. ft., we can set up the following equation:

\[ S + 7300 = 16000 \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ S = 16000 - 7300 = 8700 \]

So, the smaller house is 8,700 sq. ft. in size. Now, to find out how much it is being expanded, we subtract its current size from its future size. This can be calculated as:

\[ 8700 - 7300 = 1400 \]

So, the smaller house is being expanded by 1,400 sq. ft.

Let's denote the amount by which the smaller house is expanded by as \( x \) sq. ft.

The initial square footage of the smaller house is 5,200 sq. ft. So after expansion, its new square footage becomes \( 5200 + x \) sq. ft.

The initial square footage of the larger house is 7,300 sq. ft. So after expansion, its new square footage becomes \( 7300 + x \) sq. ft.

The total square footage of both houses after expansion is given as 16,000 sq. ft. So we can write the equation as:

\[ (5200 + x) + (7300 + x) = 16000 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 12500 + 2x = 16000 \]
\[ 2x = 16000 - 12500 \]
\[ 2x = 3500 \]
\[ x = \frac{3500}{2} \]

To find out how much the smaller house is being expanded by, we need to determine the current size of the smaller house and then subtract this from the new total square footage to find the expansion.

First, let's calculate the current total square footage of both houses:
\[ 5,200 \, \text{sq. ft.} + 7,300 \, \text{sq. ft.} = 12,500 \, \text{sq. ft.} \]

The new total square footage is given as 16,000 sq. ft., so the total expansion is:
\[ 16,000 \, \text{sq. ft.} - 12,500 \, \text{sq. ft.} = 3,500 \, \text{sq. ft.} \]

Therefore, the smaller house is being expanded by 3,500 square feet.

The initial total square footage of both houses is \( 5,200 + 7,300 = 12,500 \) square feet.

After the expansion, the total square footage of both houses becomes 16,000 square feet. This total is also equal to the initial total plus the expansion, so we have:

To find out how much the smaller house is being expanded by, we need to calculate the difference in square footage between the smaller house and the total of both houses after the expansion.

The original total square footage of both houses is the sum of the original square footage of each house:
\[ 5,200 \text{ sq. ft.} + 7,300 \text{ sq. ft.} = 12,500 \text{ sq. ft.} \]

After the expansion, the total square footage is given as 16,000 sq. ft. So, the expansion adds:
\[ 16,000 \text{ sq. ft.} - 12,500 \text{ sq. ft.} = 3,500 \text{ sq. ft.} \]

Let's denote the expansion in the smaller house as x sq. ft.

The expansion in the larger house is therefore (16000 - x) sq. ft.

Currently, the total square footage is given by:
\[ 5200 + 7300 = 12500 \text{ sq. ft.} \]

After expansion in the smaller house, the total becomes:
\[ 5200 + x + 7300 = 16000 \]

So, we have:
\[ 12500 + x = 16000 \]

Solving for x:
\[ x = 16000 - 12500 \]
\[ x = 3500 \text{ sq. ft.} \]

Thus, the smaller house is being expanded by 3500 sq. ft.
