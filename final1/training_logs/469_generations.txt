###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A lot of people have been sick at Gary's workplace, so he's been working a lot of extra shifts to fill in for people. As a result, he's earned some overtime (where every hour after 40 he earns 1.5 times his normal wage.) His paycheck (before taxes are taken out) came out to $696. If Gary normally earns $12 per hour, how many hours did he work that week?

system
Let's denote the total hours Gary worked that week as \( H \). We know that Gary normally earns $12 per hour and works an additional 12 hours (because he works every shift beyond the initial 40 hours at a higher rate).

The total earnings before taxes can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 40 \times \text{Normal Wage} + 12 \times \text{Overtime Wage} \]

Since the overtime wage is 1.5 times the normal wage, we have:
\[ \text{Overtime Wage} = 12 \times 1.5 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ 696 = 40 \times 12 + 12 \times (12 \times 1.5) \]
\[ 696 = 480 + 12 \times 18 \]
\[ 696 = 480 + 216 \]
\[ 696 = 696 \]

This confirms that Gary's total earnings are indeed $696 before taxes. 

Since each hour beyond 40 is 1.5 times the normal wage, we can directly calculate the overtime hours:
\[ \text{Total Worked Hours} = 40 + 12 = 52 \]

So, Gary worked 52 hours that week.

Let's denote the number of hours Gary worked normally (less than or equal to 40) as \( x \), and the overtime hours as \( y \).

From the information provided, we know that Gary earns $12 per hour for the first 40 hours and 1.5 times that amount ($18 per hour) for any hours worked beyond 40. His total earnings can be given by the equation:
\[ 12x + 18y = 696 \]

Additionally, the total number of hours worked is \( x + y \), and since he typically works 40 hours a week:
\[ x + y = 40 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( 12x + 18y = 696 \)
2. \( x + y = 40 \)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, let's solve the second equation for \( x \):
\[ x = 40 - y \]

Now we substitute \( x = 40 - y \) into the first equation:
\[ 12(40 - y) + 18y = 696 \]
\[ 480 - 12y + 18y = 696 \]
\[ 480 + 6y = 696 \]
\[ 6y = 216 \]
\[ y = 36 \]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \) using the equation \( x = 40 - y \):
\[ x = 40 - 36 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Gary worked 4 hours normally and 36 hours of overtime. 

Therefore, the total number of hours Gary worked that week is:
\[ 4 + 36 = 40 \]

Conclusion:
Gary worked 40 hours that week.

Let's break down the earnings Gary made:
- For the first 40 hours, he earns at his normal rate: \( 40 \times 12 = \$480 \)
- For the overtime hours beyond 40, he earns at 1.5 times his normal rate: \( (hours - 40) \times (12 \times 1.5) = (hours - 40) \times 18 \)

The total earnings before taxes is $696, which includes the $480 for the first 40 hours. So, the earnings from the overtime hours alone must be:
\[ 696 - 480 = 216 \]
\[ hours - 40 = \frac{216}{18} \]
\[ hours = 40 + \frac{216}{18} \]

Let's denote the number of hours Gary worked as \( H \).

Every hour after 40 hours, Gary earns 1.5 times his normal wage, which is \( 12 \times 1.5 = 18 \) dollars per hour.

Therefore, the total amount of money Gary earned from the first 40 hours is \( 40 \times 12 = 480 \) dollars.

Given that his total paycheck is $696, the amount earned from overtime hours is \( 696 - 480 = 216 \) dollars.

Let \( X \) be the number of overtime hours Gary worked. Since \( 18 \times X = 216 \), we can solve for \( X \) to find that \( 18X = 216 \) and \( X = 12 \). 

Therefore, Gary worked a total of \( 40 \) regular hours + \( 12 \) overtime hours = 52 hours for the week.

Let's denote the number of regular hours worked as \( h \) and the overtime hours worked as \( t \). The total hours worked in a week is \( h + t \).

The normal wage is $12 per hour for the first 40 hours, and $18 per hour for any hours beyond 40 (overtime).

The equation for the total paycheck can be set up as follows:

\[ \text{Paycheck} = 12 \times 40 + 18 \times t \]
\[ 696 = 12 \times 40 + 18 \times t \]

Now, let's solve for \( t \).

\[ 696 = 480 + 18t \]
\[ 696 - 480 = 18t \]
\[ 216 = 18t \]
\[ t = 12 \]

Now that we have the number of overtime hours, we can find the total hours worked by adding the regular hours and the overtime hours:

\[ \text{Total hours} = h + t \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 40 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 52 \]

So, Gary worked 52 hours that week.

First, let's calculate the normal earnings Gary would have made if he didn't work overtime. Since he normally earns $12 per hour, for 40 hours he would have earned:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \]

Since his total paycheck after overtime is $696, and we know he earned $480 in normal work hours, the overtime earnings are:
\[ 696 - 480 = 216 \]

The extra time he worked, if taken as hours, would be \(\frac{216}{12} = 18\) hours. Since this represents the hours worked over and above the original 40 hours, the additional hours worked on top of his normal 40 hours would be:
\[ 18 - 40 = -22 \]

Since this result is negative, it suggests we incorrectly interpreted the overtime calculation. The overtime rate is 1.5 times the normal rate, so if he worked 22 hours of overtime, his total earnings would be:
\[ 40 \times 12 + 22 \times (12 \times 1.5) = 480 + 22 \times 18 = 480 + 396 = 876 \]

This $876 does not match with $696. Let's re-examine the percentages and understand that the total hours worked, whether normal or overtime, have to match in proportion to find his total hours worked that week. Since his normal 40 hours plus the 22 hours of overtime = 62 hours (40+22=62), and his paycheck is $696, we divide the total earnings by the hourly rate to find hours worked, then subtract the original 40 hours:

\[ \frac{696}{12} = 58 \]

So, he actually worked 58 hours in total. Subtracting the normal 40 hours, he worked:
\[ 58 - 40 = 18 \]

So, the answer is 18 hours.

To solve this, let's calculate Gary's normal pay and overtime pay separately and then find out the total hours worked.

1. **Normal Pay**: Gary earns $12 per hour and works 40 regular hours at that rate. 

   \[
   \text{Normal Pay} = 40 \times 12 = 480 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Overtime Pay**: Gary worked overtime, and his wage increases to $18 per hour ($12 + $6 increase per hour). Let's denote the number of overtime hours as $x$. The overtime pay can be calculated as 

   \[
   \text{Overtime Pay} = x \times 18 = 18x \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Pay**: The total paycheck, including both normal and overtime pay, is $696. Thus, we can set up the following equation:

   \[
   696 = 480 + 18x
   \]

4. **Solving for $x$**:

   \[
   18x = 696 - 480 \implies 18x = 216 \implies x = \frac{216}{18} = 12
   \]

   Therefore, Gary worked 12 additional hours in overtime.

5. **Total Hours Worked**:

   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 40 \text{ (regular hours)} + 12 \text{ (overtime hours)} = 52 \text{ hours}

Let's calculate the total earnings contributed by the overtime hours first. Gary has earned $696 - (40 hours * $12/hour) = $696 - $480 = $216 from the overtime hours. 

Now, let's assume Gary worked \(x\) hours overtime. Therefore, he earned \(1.5 * 12 * x\) from these overtime hours.

So, the total earnings are equation can be represented as:
\[40 \times 12 + 1.5 \times 12 \times x = 696\] 

Simplifying the first part, we get:
\[480 + 1.5 \times 12 \times x = 696\]

\[1.5 \times 12 \times x = 696 - 480\]

\[1.5 \times 12 \times x = 216\]

\[18x = 216\]

\[x = 216 / 18\]

\[x = 12\]

So, Gary worked 12 hours of overtime that week.

Therefore, the total number of hours Gary worked that week is 40 (normal hours) + 12 (overtime hours) = 52 hours.

Let's denote Gary's normal hourly wage as \( W = \$12 \) per hour. He earned overtime when he worked more than 40 hours. Let the number of hours he worked normally be \( h \) and the number of overtime hours be \( t \).

We know:
1. \( h + t \) is the total number of hours worked.
2. The overtime pay rate is 1.5 times the normal wage, so he earns \( 1.5W \).
3. The total earnings before taxes include both the normal hours and the overtime hours: \( 12h + 1.5 \cdot 12 \cdot t \).
4. The total earnings before taxes is $696.

First, we express the total earnings from hours worked:
\[ 40 \cdot 12 + (h + t - 40) \cdot 12.5 = 696 \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 480 + 12.5(h + t - 40) = 696 \]
\[ 480 + 12.5h + 12.5t - 500 = 696 \]
\[ 12.5h + 12.5t = 796 \]
\[ h + t = 63.76 \]

Since \( h + t \) must be a whole number (as we cannot work a fraction of an hour), we need to adjust our approach. Let's assume \( h = 40 \) (the normal number of hours).

Then:
\[ h + t = 63.76 \rightarrow 40 + t = 63.76 \rightarrow t = 23.76 \]

Let's verify:
\[ 40 \cdot 12 + 23.76 \cdot 12.5 = 480 + 312.0 = 792 \]

This needs to be adjusted slightly as the total should be exactly 696. Let's try \( h = 41 \) (one hour more than 40).

Then:
\[ 41 + t = 63.76 \rightarrow t = 22.76 \]

Let's verify:
\[ 41 \cdot 12 + 22.76 \cdot 12.5 = 492 + 284.5 = 776.5 \]

Since this is close but not exact, we need to adjust slightly. Let's try \( h = 42 \):

Then:
\[ 42 + t = 63.76 \rightarrow t = 21.76 \]

Let's verify:
\[ 42 \cdot 12 + 21.76 \cdot 12.5 = 504 + 272.0 = 776 \]

This is still not exact. Therefore, we need to find the exact number of overtime hours.

Let's solve the system of equations correctly:
\[ 40 \cdot 12 + (h + t - 40) \cdot 12.5 = 696 \]
\[ 480 + 12.5(t) = 696 \]
\[ 12.5t = 216 \]
\[ t = 17.28 \]

Thus:
\[ h + t = 63.76 \rightarrow h = 46.28 \]
\[ h + t = 63.76 \rightarrow t

Let's denote Gary's normal hourly wage as \( W \) and the total number of hours Gary worked in the week as \( H \).

Gary normally earns \( W = \$12 \) per hour. 

For the first 40 hours, he earns \( 40 \times W = \$12 \times 40 = \$480 \).

For the overtime hours, which are \( H - 40 \) hours, he earns \( 1.5 \times W = 1.5 \times \$12 = \$18 \) per hour.

Thus, his total pay is the sum of the wages for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:

\[ 40W + 1.5W(H - 40) = 696 \]

Plugging in \( W = \$12 \) and simplifying, we get:

\[ 12 \times 40 + 18 \times (H - 40) = 696 \]

\[ 480 + 18H - 720 = 696 \]

2. Gary's total paycheck before taxes is $696.

3. Let's assume Gary worked \( x \) hours in overtime. Therefore, he worked \( x \) hours at $18 per hour and \( 40 - x \) hours at his normal rate of $12 per hour.

4. So, the total earned from overtime is \( 18x \) and the total earned from normal hours is \( 12(40 - x) \).

Let's break down Gary's overtime pay into two parts. For the first 40 hours, he earns his normal wage of $12 per hour. The overtime, which is the additional hours worked after 40 hours, earns him 1.5 times his normal wage, so he earns $12 * 1.5 = $18 per hour of overtime.

Gary earned a total of $696, which we can split into his regular wage and his overtime pay. Let's first calculate how much he earned from his regular hours:

$696 - (40 * $12) = $696 - $480 = $216

This $216 is the total amount he earned from working overtime. Since he earns $18 per hour of overtime, we can calculate the number of overtime hours he worked:

2. His paycheck is $696 after taxes.

To find out how many hours he worked that week, let's consider the total hours worked.

First, we calculate the normal pay for 40 hours (since he got 1.5 times his normal wage for overtime):
\[ 40 \times 12 = 480 \]

Then, the remaining amount in his paycheck ($696 - $480 = $216) corresponds to the overtime pay, which he earns at a rate of 1.5 times his normal wage (12 * 1.5 = $18).

The number of overtime hours is the overtime pay divided by the overtime wage rate:
\[ 216 / 18 = 12 \] hours of overtime.
