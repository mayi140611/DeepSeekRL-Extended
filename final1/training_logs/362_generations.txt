Let's denote the weights of Kevin's briefcase when empty as \( B \) pounds, the weight of Karen's tote bag as \( T \) pounds, and the weight of Kevin’s laptop as \( L \) pounds.

From the information given:
1. Karen's tote bag is twice the weight of her husband Kevin's briefcase when the briefcase is empty: \( T = 2B \).
2. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, the weight is twice the weight of Karen's tote: \( B + L = 2T \).
3. Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase, but since the weight of the tote bag is \( T \), and the weight of the briefcase when full is \( T + L \), we have \( \frac{1}{6}(T + L) = B \).

Given that Karen's tote bag weighs 8 pounds (\( T = 8 \)), we can calculate Kevin's briefcase weight when empty:

\[ T = 2B \]
\[ 8 = 2B \]
\[ B = 4 \]

Now, using the relationship between the weight of Kevin's laptop and the briefcase:

\[ B + L = 2T \]
\[ 4 + L = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ 4 + L = 16 \]
\[ L = 12 \]

Kevin's laptop weighs 12 pounds.

To find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote:

\[ L - T = 12 - 8 \]
\[ L - T = 4 \]

Kevin's laptop weighs 4 pounds more than Karen’s tote.

To determine how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote, we need to analyze the given information step by step:

1. Let's denote the weight of Karen's tote bag as \( T \) and the weight of Kevin's briefcase when empty as \( B \). We know \( T = 8 \) pounds.

2. According to the information, Karen’s work tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s briefcase when the briefcase is empty. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   B = \frac{T}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote. Let's denote the weight of Kevin’s laptop as \( L \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   B + L = 2T
   \]
   Substituting \( T = 8 \) into the equation:
   \[
   4 + L = 2 \times 8
   \]
   \[
   4 + L = 16
   \]
   \[
   L = 16 - 4
   \]
   \[
   L = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. We are also given that Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase. Let the weight of Kevin’s work papers be \( P \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   P = \frac{B + L}{6}
   \]
   Substituting \( B = 4 \) and \( L = 12 \) into the equation:
   \[
   P = \frac{4 + 12}{6}
   \]
   \[
   P = \frac{16}{6}
   \]
   \[
   P = \frac{8}{3} \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. To find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote, we subtract the weight of Karen’s tote from the weight of Kevin’s laptop:
   \[
   L - T = 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Let's denote the weight of Kevin's briefcase when empty as \( B_e \) and the weight of his laptop as \( L \). The weight of Kevin's work papers when empty is \( W_p \).

From the information given:
1. When Kevin's briefcase is empty, the weight of Karen's tote bag (T) is twice the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase: \( T = 2B_e \).
2. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen's tote bag: \( B_f = 2T \), where \( B_f \) is the total weight of Kevin's full briefcase.
3. Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase: \( W_p = \frac{1}{6}B_f \) or \( W_p = \frac{1}{6}(2T) = \frac{1}{3}T \).

Given that Karen's tote bag weighs 8 pounds:
\[ T = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Kenny's briefcase is empty and:
\[ B_e = T = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Using the first piece of information, \( T = 2B_e \):
\[ T = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, using the information about the full briefcase:
\[ B_f = 2T = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ pounds} \]

Using the information about Kevin's work papers:
\[ W_p = \frac{1}{3}T = \frac{1}{3} \times 16 = \frac{16}{3} \text{ pounds} \]

The weight of Kevin's laptop:
\[ L = B_f - (B_e + W_p) = 32 - (8 + \frac{16}{3}) = 32 - 8 - \frac{16}{3} = 24 - \frac{16}{3} = \frac{72}{3} - \frac{16}{3} = \frac{56}{3} \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find how many more pounds Kevin's laptop weighs than Karen's tote:
\[ L - T = \frac{56}{3} - 8 = \frac{56}{3} - \frac{24}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Kevin’s laptop weighs \( \frac{32}{3} \) pounds more than Karen’s tote.

Let's denote the weight of Kevin's laptop as \( L \) pounds and the weight of his work papers as \( P \) pounds.

Given that Karen’s work tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s briefcase when it is empty (which we can denote as \( B \)), we can write:
\[ B = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote bag, so we can write:
\[ B + L + P = 16 + L + P \]

We also know that Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase, so we can write:
\[ P = \frac{L + P}{6} \]

From this, we can solve for \( P \):
\[ 6P = L + P \]
\[ 5P = L \]
\[ P = \frac{L}{5} \]

Now we can substitute \( P \) in the equation for the total weight of Kevin's shortcase when it is full:
\[ 16 + L + \frac{L}{5} = 16 + \frac{6L}{5} \]

We know that when Kevin puts his laptop in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote bag:
\[ B + L = 8 + L = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]
\[ L = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Now we can calculate the weight of the laptop:
\[ P = \frac{L}{5} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we can find how many more pounds the laptop weighs than Karen's tote bag:
\[ L - B = 8 - 8 = 0 \]

The laptop weighs 0 pounds more than Karen’s tote bag.

Let's break down the problem systematically.

1. When Kevin's briefcase is empty, Karen's tote weighs 8 pounds.
2. When Kevin's briefcase is full (with the laptop and work papers), it is twice the weight of Karen's tote. Therefore, the weight of the full briefcase is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) pounds.
3. Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase. Therefore, the weight of the work papers is \(\frac{16}{6}\) pounds.
4. The net weight added by the laptop and work papers is \(16 - \frac{16}{6}\) pounds. Simplifying this, we get \(\frac{96}{6} - \frac{16}{6} = \frac{80}{6} = 13\frac{2}{3}\) pounds.
5. The laptop weighs \(13\frac{2}{3}\) pounds + 8 pounds (Karen's tote) = 21 pounds.
6. Now, the weight of the laptop is \(\frac{80}{6} = 13\frac{2}{3}\) pounds.

So Kevin’s laptop weighs \(13\frac{2}{3}\) pounds which is 3 pounds more than Karen's tote.

Let's denote the following for the problem:
- \( K_b \) = weight of Kevin's briefcase when empty
- \( K_t \) = weight of Kevin's laptop
- \( W_p \) = weight of Karen's work papers
- \( K_t + K_b - W_p = 8 \) pounds (1)

When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers into his briefcase, the weight becomes twice the weight of Karen's tote bag which is \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) pounds (2).

So from equation (2), we can write:
\[ K_b + K_t - W_p = 16 \] (3)

From equation (1), we have:
\[ K_b = 2 \times 8 = 16 \] pounds (4)

Substituting equation (4) into equation (3), we find out the weight of Karen's work papers (W_p):
\[ 16 + K_t - W_p = 16 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ K_t - W_p = 0 \]
\[ K_t = W_p \] (5)

From equation (5) we understand that the weight of Kevin’s laptop is equal to the weight of his work papers.

Since Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase:
\[ W_p = \frac{1}{6} (16 + K_t) \]

Since \( K_t = W_p \), we can substitute \( K_t \):
\[ W_p = \frac{1}{6}(16 + W_p) \]
\[ 6W_p = 16 + W_p \]
\[ 5W_p = 16 \]
\[ W_p = \frac{16}{5} \] 

Thus, the number of pounds that Kevin’s laptop and work papers together weigh is:
\[ K_t + W_p = 16 + \frac{16}{5} = \frac{16 \times 6}{5} = \frac{96}{5} \]

Finally, the weight Kevin's laptop is more than Karen's tote bag:
\[ \frac{96}{5} - 8 = \frac{96}{5} - \frac{40}{5} = \frac{56}{5} \]

Hence, Kevin’s laptop and work papers together weigh more than Karen's tote bag by \(\frac{56}{5}\) pounds, which is 11.2 pounds.

1. Let \( B \) be the weight of Kevin's work papers. We are given that the weight of Kevin's work papers is a sixth of the weight of his entire briefcase, so:
   \[
   B = \frac{1}{6} (2T)
   \]
   where \( T \) is the weight of the contents of Kevin's full briefcase.

2. Since Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of his entire briefcase, and his briefcase is twice the weight of Karen's tote bag when empty, the weight of Kevin's full briefcase can be calculated as:
   \[
   T = 2K
   \]
   where \( K \) is the weight of Karen's tote bag when empty.

3. Given that \( K = 8 \) pounds, we can substitute:
   \[

   \]

4. Substituting \( T \) back into the equation for \( B \), we get:

   B = \frac{1}{6} \times 16 = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. Let \( L \) be the weight of Kevin's laptop. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, the weight of the full briefcase is:
   \[
   T + L = 16 + L

7. Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = 16 - 16 = 0 \text{ pounds}

Given:
- Karen’s tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase.
- Kevin's full briefcase is twice the weight of Karen’s tote.
- Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of his full briefcase.

Let's denote:
- The weight of Karen’s empty tote as \( T \).
- The weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase as \( B \).
- The weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase + work papers as \( F \).
- The weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase + laptop + work papers as \( G \).

From the problem statement, we have:
1. \( T = 2B \)
2. \( G = 2F \)
3. \( \text{Work papers} = \frac{1}{6}F \)

We need to find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. From the first condition, \( T = 2B \), and we know that \( T = 8 \) pounds.
   \[
   8 = 2B \implies B = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. From the second condition, \( G = 2F \). We need to find the total weight \( G \) when Kevin's empty briefcase is filled with his laptop and work papers.

   Since Kevin's work papers (work papers) are \(\frac{1}{6}F \), we can find \( F \) (total weight of the briefcase when filled):
   \[
   \frac{1}{6}F = \text{Work papers}
   \]

   Therefore, the total weight \( G \) is:
   \[
   F + \text{Work papers} = F + \frac{1}{6}F = \frac{7}{6}F = G
   \]

   Substituting \( G = 2F \), we have:
   \[
   2F = \frac{7}{6}F \implies 12F = 14F \implies F = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Therefore:
   - \( G = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pounds} \)
   - \( F = 12 \text{ pounds} \)

4. We already know:
   - \( T = 8 \text{ pounds} \)

5. Now, Kevin’s laptop is \( G - T = 24 - 8 = 16 \text{ pounds} \).

Finally:
\[
\text{Difference in weight} = G - T = 16 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, \( \boxed{16} \) pounds.

**Conclusion:**
Kevin’s laptop weighs 16 more pounds than Karen’s tote.

Let's denote the weight of Kevin's laptop as \( L \) and the weight of Karen's work papers as \( P \).

Given:
1. Karen's work tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin's briefcase when the briefcase is empty.
2. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen's tote.
3. Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase.
4. Karen’s work tote bag weighs 8 pounds.

From the first point, when the briefcase is empty, the tote bag weighs twice the weight of the briefcase. Let \( W_{briefcase} \) be the weight of Kevin's briefcase when empty. Therefore, we have:
\[ 8 = 2W_{briefcase} \]
\[ W_{briefcase} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

From the second point, when Kevin's briefcase is full (with the laptop and work papers), the weight is twice the weight of the tote bag. Let \( W_{full\_briefcase} \) be the full weight of Kevin's briefcase. Therefore, we have:
\[ W_{full\_briefcase} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

From the third point, Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase. Let \( P_{papers} \) be the weight of the work papers. Therefore, we have:
\[ P_{papers} = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the weight of Kevin's laptop \( L \). The total weight of Kevin's full briefcase contains the weight of the laptop and the work papers. Therefore, we have:
\[ W_{full\_briefcase} = L + P_{papers} \]
\[ 16 = L + \frac{8}{3} \]
\[ 16 - \frac{8}{3} = L \]
\[ \frac{48}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = L \]
\[ \frac{40}{3} = L \]
\[ L = \frac{40}{3} \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we need to find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote. We have:
\[ L - 8 = \frac{40}{3} - 8 = \frac{40}{3} - \frac{24}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \text{ pounds} \]

So, \( \frac{16}{3} \) more pounds does Kevin’s laptop weigh than Karen’s tote.

Let's start by defining the variables for the weights of the items:
- Let \( B \) be the weight of Kevin's briefcase when empty.
- Let \( T \) be the weight of Karen's tote bag when empty.
- Let \( L \) be the weight of Kevin's laptop.

Given:
1. \( T = 2B \) (Karen’s work tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s briefcase when empty).
2. \( T + L + P = 2(B + L + P) \) (When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote).
3. \( P = \frac{1}{6}(B + L + P) \) (Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of the full briefcase).

We need to find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote when Karen's tote is empty. First, replace \( T \) in the second equation with \( 2B \):

\[ 2B + L + P = 2(B + L + P) \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 2B + L + P = 2B + 2L + 2P \]

Subtract \( 2B \) from both sides:

\[ L + P = 2L + 2P \]

Subtract \( L \) from both sides:

\[ P = L + P \]

Subtract \( P \) from both sides:

\[ 0 = L \]

This is incorrect, so let's correct it:

\[ 2B + L + P = 2(B + L + 2P) \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 2B + L + P = 2B + 2L + 4P \]

Subtract \( 2B \) from both sides:

\[ L + P = 2L + 4P \]

Subtract \( L \) from both sides:

\[ P = L + 3P \]

Subtract \( P \) from both sides:

\[ 0 = L + 2P \]

Then, solve for \( L \):

\[ L = -2P \]

Since \( P \) is a weight, it cannot be negative, so let's correct the logic:

\[ L = 2P \]
\[ P = \frac{1}{6} (B + 2P) \]

Substitute \( P = \frac{1}{6} (B + 2P) \) into \( L = 2P \):

\[ L = 2 \left( \frac{1}{6} (B + 2P) \right) \]

Simplify:

\[ L = \frac{2}{6} (B + 2P) \]
\[ L = \frac{1}{3} (B + 2P) \]

Since \( P \) is part of the empty briefcase, \( P = \frac{1}{6} B \):

\[ L = \frac{1}{3} \left( B + 2 \left( \frac{1}{6} B \right) \right) \]
\[ L = \frac{1}{3} \left( B + \frac{1}{3} B \right) \]
\[ L = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{4}{3} B \right) \]
\[ L = \frac{4}{9} B \]

Now calculate the difference between the weight of Kevin's laptop and the weight of Karen’s tote when Karen's tote is empty:

\[ L - T = \frac{4}{9} B - 2B

Let's define the variables for the weight of the items in Kevin's briefcase. Let \( x \) be the weight of the contents of Kevin's full briefcase, \( y \) be the weight of Kevin's laptop, and \( w \) be the weight of the work papers.

From the problem, we know:
1. Karen’s tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase, so the weight of the empty briefcase is \( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 4 \text{ pounds} \).
2. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote, so \( x + y = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ pounds} \).
3. Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase, so \( y = \frac{x}{6} \).

We now have a system of equations:
1. \( x + y = 16 \)
2. \( y = \frac{x}{6} \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( x \):
\[ x + \frac{x}{6} = 16 \]
Multiply through by 6 to clear the fraction:
\[ 6x + x = 96 \]
\[ 7x = 96 \]
\[ x = \frac{96}{7} \]

Now substitute \( x \) back into the equation \( y = \frac{x}{6} \):
\[ y = \frac{96}{7 \times 6} = \frac{96}{42} = \frac{16}{7} \]

So the weight of Kevin's laptop is \( \frac{16}{7} \) pounds. The weight of Karen’s tote is 8 pounds. The difference in weight between the laptop and the tote is:
\[ \frac{16}{7} - 8 = \frac{16}{7} - \frac{56}{7} = \frac{16 - 56}{7} = \frac{-40}{7} \]

Therefore, Kevin’s laptop weighs \(\boxed{\frac{40}{7}}\) pounds less than Karen’s tote.

To solve this problem, let's define the variables and relationships among the weights of the items.

Let \( B \) be the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase in pounds.

Given:
1. Karen’s work tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase, so:
   \[
   T = 2B
   \]
2. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote, so:
   \[
   B + \text{work papers} = 2T
   \]
3. Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase, so if the weight of the laptop is \( L \) pounds, the work papers weigh:
   \[
   \text{work papers} = \frac{1}{6}(L + B)
   \]

Substituting \( T = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[
B + \frac{1}{6}(L + B) = 2 \times 2B
\]
\[
B + \frac{1}{6}L + \frac{1}{6}B = 4B
\]
\[
\frac{7}{6}B + \frac{1}{6}L = 4B
\]
Multiply through by 6 to clear the fractions:
\[
7B + L = 24B
\]
\[
L = 24B - 7B
\]
\[
L = 17B
\]

We are given that Karen’s tote weighs 8 pounds:
\[
T = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
So:
\[
2B = 8
\]
\[
B = 4 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, substitute \( B = 4 \) pounds into the equations for \( L \):
\[
L = 17B = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, the difference in weight between Kevin’s laptop and Karen's tote is:
\[
L - T = 68 - 8 = 60 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Kevin’s laptop weighs 60 more pounds than Karen’s tote.

3. Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase, which means the weight of the full briefcase is \( 6P \).
4. Karen’s tote weighs 8 pounds.

Let's denote the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase as \( B \).

From point 1, we have:
\[ 8 = 2B \]
\[ B = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

From point 2, we have:
\[ 8 + L + P = 2 \times 4 \]
\[ 8 + L + P = 8 \]
\[ L + P = 0 \]

From point 3, we have:
\[ 6P = 8 + L \]
\[ 6P = L + 8 \]

Now, from point 4, we know \( B = 4 \) pounds, and since Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase, we can set up the following equation:
\[ P = \frac{1}{6} \times (4 + L) \]
\[ P = \frac{4 + L}{6} \]

Substituting \( P \) in the previous equation:
\[ 6 \times \left(\frac{4 + L}{6}\right) = L + 8 \]
\[ 4 + L = L + 8 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ 4 + L - L = L + 8 - L \]
\[ 4 = 8 \]

This simplifies to a contradiction, which means we need to approach the problem differently. Let's solve it step-by-step in a different way:

From point 2, we have:
\[ 8 + L + P = 2 \times 4 \]
\[ 8 + L + P = 8 \]
\[ L + P = 0 \]

From point 3, we have:
\[ 6P = L + 8 \]

Since \( L + P = 0 \), we can substitute \( P \) as \( -L \):
\[ 6(-L) = L + 8 \]
\[ -6L = L + 8 \]
\[ -6L - L = 8 \]
\[ -7L = 8 \]
\[ L = -\frac{8}{7} \]

This is incorrect. Let's revisit the problem step by step:
1. Since \( L + P = 0 \), it implies \( P = -L \).
2. Substitute \( P \) in \( 6P = L + 8 \):
\[ 6(-L) = L + 8 \]
\[ -6L = L + 8 \]
\[ -6L - L = 8 \]
\[ -7L = 8 \]
\[ L = -\frac{8}{7} \]

This is still incorrect. Let's solve it again with a different approach.

From point 2, we have:
\[ 8 + L + P = 2 \times 4 \]
\[ 8 + L + P = 8 \]
\[ L + P = 0 \]

From point 3, we have:
\[ 6P = L + 8 \]

Since \( L + P = 0 \), we can substitute \( P \) as

To solve this problem, let's define the variables and use the given information to set up equations. Let \(K_W\) be the weight of Karen's tote bag and \(K_B\) be the weight of Kevin's briefcase. According to the problem:

1. Karen’s work tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin's briefcase when the briefcase is empty:
\[ K_W = 2K_B \]
Given that \(K_W = 8\) pounds:
\[ 8 = 2K_B \]
\[ K_B = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

2. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote:
\[ K_B + \text{Laptop} + \text{Work Papers} = 2K_W \]
\[ 4 + L + W = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ 4 + L + W = 16 \]
\[ L + W = 12 \]
\[ W = 12 - L \]

3. Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase:
\[ W = \frac{1}{6}(K_B + L + W) \]
Substituting \(W = 12 - L\):
\[ 12 - L = \frac{1}{6}(4 + L + (12 - L)) \]
\[ 12 - L = \frac{1}{6}(16) \]
\[ 12 - L = \frac{16}{6} \]
\[ 12 - L = \frac{8}{3} \]
\[ 12 - \frac{8}{3} = L \]
\[ \frac{36}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = L \]
\[ L = \frac{28}{3} \]
\[ L = 9 \frac{1}{3} \text{ pounds} \]

4. The weight of the laptop is \(9 \frac{1}{3}\) pounds. To find out how many more pounds the laptop weighs than Karen’s tote bag, we subtract the weight of the tote from the weight of the laptop:
\[ L - K_W = \frac{28}{3} - 8 \]
\[ L - K_W = \frac{28}{3} - \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ L - K_W = \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ L - K_W = 1 \frac{1}{3} \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Kevin’s laptop weighs \(\boxed{1 \frac{1}{3}}\) pounds more than Karen’s tote bag.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Weight of Kevin's Tote when Empty:**
   - Karen's tote is twice the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase.
   - Karen’s tote weight = 8 pounds.
   - Let K be the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase.
   - We know that \(8 = 2K\).

2. **Weight of Kevin's Tote when Full:**
   - When Kevin's laptop and work papers are in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen's tote.
   - Let \(L\) be the weight of the laptop.
   - Let \(WP\) be the weight of the work papers.
   - The total weight of Kevin's full briefcase is \(L + WP\).
   - We know that \(L + WP = 2 \times 8 = 16\) pounds.

3. **Weight of Work Papers:**
   - The weight of Kevin's work papers is a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase.
   - \(WP = \frac{1}{6}(L + WP)\).

4. **Solving for \(L\) and \(WP\):**

   From \(8 = 2K\), we can solve for \(K\):
   \[
   K = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pounds.}
   \]

   Now, substituting \(K = 4\) into the equation \(L + WP = 16\):
   \[
   L + WP = 16.
   \]

   Substituting \(WP = \frac{1}{6}(L + WP)\) into the equation:
   \[
   L + \frac{1}{6}(L + 16) = 16.
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \(L\):
   \[
   L + \frac{1}{6}L + \frac{16}{6} = 16,
   \]
   \[
   \frac{7}{6}L + \frac{32}{6} = 16,
   \]
   \[
   \frac{7}{6}L = 16 - \frac{32}{6},
   \]
   \[
   \frac{7}{6}L = \frac{96}{6} - \frac{32}{6},
   \]
   \[
   \frac{7}{6}L = \frac{64}{6},
   \]
   \[
   L = \frac{64}{7}.
   \]

5. **Weight of Karen's Tote compared to Kevin's Full Tote:**
   - The weight of Kevin's full briefcase (\(K + L\)) is:
   \[
   4 + \frac{64}{7} = \frac{28}{7} + \frac{64}{7} = \frac{92}{7}.
   \]
   - The weight of Karen's tote is 8 pounds.

6. **Difference in Weight:**
   - The weight difference is:
   \[
   \frac{92}{7} - 8 = \frac{92}{7} - \frac{56}{7} = \frac{36}{7}.
   \]

   Therefore, Kevin's laptop weighs \(\frac{36}{7}\) pounds more than Karen's tote.

**Final Answer:**
Kevin’s laptop weighs \(\frac{36}{7}\) pounds more than Karen's tote.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. Karen’s work tote bag weighs 8 pounds.
2. Kevin's briefcase is twice the weight of Karen’s tote when it's empty, so it weighs \(2 \times 8 = 16\) pounds.
3. Let \(L\) be the weight of Kevin's laptop and \(P\) be the weight of his work papers. According to the information given, \(L + P = 16\) pounds (when Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in the briefcase).
4. Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase. This means the total weight of the contents of his full briefcase (laptop plus work papers) is \(6 \times P\).
5. We know that the total weight when Kevin's briefcase is full is twice the weight of Karen’s tote, so \(L + P = 2 \times 8 = 16\) pounds. We also know that the total weight when his briefcase is full is \(6 \times P + L = 16\) pounds.
6. From \(6 \times P + L = 16\) and \(L + P = 16\), we can solve for \(L\) and \(P\).

Let's solve it step by step:

From the equation \(L + P = 16\), we can express \(P\) as \(P = 16 - L\).

Substitute \(P\) in the second equation:

\(6 \times (16 - L) + L = 16\)

\(96 - 6L + L = 16\)

\(96 - 5L = 16\)

\(5L = 80\)

\(L = 16\)

Now we know Kevin's laptop weighs 16 pounds. 

To find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote, we subtract the weight of Karen's tote from the weight of Kevin's laptop:

\(16 - 8 = 8\)

So, Kevin’s laptop weighs 8 pounds more than Karen’s tote.
