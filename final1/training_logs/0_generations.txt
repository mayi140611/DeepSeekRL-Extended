To find out how many clips Natalia sold in April and May, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find clips sold in April:**
   - Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April.

2. **Find clips sold in May:**
   - She sold half as many clips in May as she did in April. 
   - Clips sold in May = 1/2 \times Clips sold in April
   - Clips sold in May = 1/2 \times 48 = 24 clips

3. **Calculate total clips sold in April and May:**
   - Clips sold in April = 48
   - Clips sold in May = 24
   - Total clips sold = Clips in April + Clips in May

4. **Do the addition:**
   - Total clips sold = 48 + 24 = 72 clips

So, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.

To find out how many clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we first need to determine the number of clips she sold in May.

Given:
- Natalia sold 48 clips in April.
- She sold half as many clips in May as she did in April.

To find out how many clips she sold in May, we calculate:
\[ \text{Clips sold in May} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we add the number of clips sold in April and May to find the total:
\[ \text{Total clips sold} = 48 + 24 = 72 \]

Therefore, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.

To find out how many clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we can break it down step by step:

1. **Clips sold in April**: This is given as 48 clips.
2. **Clips sold in May**: This is half the amount sold in April, so we calculate it as follows:
   \[
   \text{Clips sold in May} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ clips}
   \]
3. **Total clips sold in April and May**: We add the clips sold in April and the clips sold in May:
   \[
   \text{Total clips} = \text{Clips sold in April} + \text{Clips sold in May} = 48 + 24 = 72 \text{ clips}
   \]

Therefore, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.

To find out how many clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many clips Natalia sold in May. Since she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April, we can calculate the number of clips sold in May using the formula:
   Number of clips sold in May = (Number of clips sold in April) / 2
   Number of clips sold in May = 48 / 2
   Number of clips sold in May = 24

2. Now that we know Natalia sold 24 clips in May, we can add that to the number of clips she sold in April to get the total number of clips sold in both months:
   Total clips sold in April and May = (Number of clips sold in April) + (Number of clips sold in May)
   Total clips sold in April and May = 48 + 24
   Total clips sold in April and May = 72

Therefore, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.

To find out how many clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of clips sold in May, which is half the number sold in April.
2. Sum the clips sold in April and May to get the total.

From the information given:
- Natalia sold 48 clips in April.
- The number of clips sold in May is half of the April sales, which is \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) clips.

Now, we can find the total number of clips sold by adding the April and May sales:
- Total clips sold = Clips sold in April + Clips sold in May
- Total clips sold = 48 + 24 = 72 clips

So, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.

Therefore, the answer is 72 clips.

To determine the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many clips Natalia sold in May.
2. Calculate the total number of clips sold over the two months by summing the clips sold in April and May.

First, we know that Natalia sold 48 clips in April. In May, she sold half as many clips as in April. Therefore, the number of clips sold in May is:

\[
\frac{48}{2} = 24
\]

Next, we add the number of clips sold in April and May to find the total number of clips sold over the two months:

\[
48 + 24 = 72
\]

So, the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May is:

\[
\boxed{72}

To find out how many clips Natalia sold in May, we need to calculate half of the number she sold in April.

In April, Natalia sold 48 clips.

Half of 48 is \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\).

So, Natalia sold 24 clips in May.

To find the total number of clips sold in both April and May, we add the number sold in April to the number sold in May:

\(48\) (April) \(+ 24\) (May) \(= 72\) clips.

Therefore, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.

To find the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May, we need to consider the number of clips sold in each month separately.

First, Natalia sold 48 clips in April.

Next, according to the problem, she sold half as many clips in May. Therefore, we calculate half of the clips sold in April:
\[
\frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ clips}
\]

Now, to find the total number of clips sold in both months, we add the number of clips sold in April to the number of clips sold in May:
\[
48 + 24 = 72 \text{ clips}
\]

Thus, Natalia sold a total of \boxed{72} clips within the two months of April and May.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of clips sold in May and then combine it with the number sold in April.

In April, Natalia sold 48 clips. According to the problem, in May, she sold half as many clips as she did in April.

Let's calculate the number of clips sold in May first:
\[ \text{Clips sold in May} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Clips sold in April} \]
\[ \text{Clips sold in May} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ \text{Clips sold in May} = 24 \]

Now, we combine the clips sold in April and May to find the total:
\[ \text{Total clips sold} = \text{Clips sold in April} + \text{Clips sold in May} \]
\[ \text{Total clips sold} = 48 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Total clips sold} = 72 \]

Therefore, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.
