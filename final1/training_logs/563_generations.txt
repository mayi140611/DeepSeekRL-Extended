system
To determine how much more money Jessica has than Rodney, we need to first find out how much money Ian has and then use that to find out how much money Rodney has. 

1. Jessica has $100.
2. Ian has half as much money as Jessica, so Ian has $100 / 2 = $50.
3. Rodney has $35 more than Ian, so Rodney has $50 + $35 = $85.

Now, to find out how much more money Jessica has than Rodney, we subtract the amount Rodney has from the amount Jessica has:

$100 - $85 = $15

Therefore, Jessica has $15 more than Rodney.

Let's start by figuring out how much money Jessica, Ian, and Rodney have. 

Given that:
1. Jessica has $100.
2. Ian has half as much money as Jessica, so Ian has $100 / 2 = $50.
3. Rodney has $35 more than Ian, so Rodney has $50 + $35 = $85.

Now, to find out how much more money Jessica has than Rodney:
Jessica's money - Rodney's money = $100 - $85 = $15.

So, Jessica has $15 more than Rodney.

We know that Jessica has $100. Ian has half of Jessica's money, so Ian has:

\[ \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Rodney has $35 more than Ian, so Rodney has:

\[ 50 + 35 = 85 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money Jessica has than Rodney, we subtract Rodney's amount from Jessica's amount:

\[ 100 - 85 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Jessica has $15 more than Rodney.

Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

1. **Jessica's Money:**
   Jessica has 100 dollars.

2. **Ian's Money:**
   Ian has half as much money as Jessica. So,
   \[
   \text{Ian's money} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Rodney's Money:**
   Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian. So,
   \[
   \text{Rodney's money} = 50 + 35 = 85 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Difference between Jessica's and Rodney's Money:**
   Jessica's money is 100 dollars and Rodney's money is 85 dollars. So,
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 100 - 85 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Jessica has 15 dollars more than Rodney.

To solve this problem, let's first determine how much money Ian has. Since Ian has half as much money as Jessica, and Jessica has 100 dollars, Ian has \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) dollars.

Next, we know that Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian. Therefore, Rodney has \( 50 + 35 = 85 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more money Jessica has than Rodney, we subtract Rodney's amount from Jessica's amount: \( 100 - 85 = 15 \) dollars.

So, Jessica has 15 dollars more than Rodney.

system
Let's denote the amount of money Ian has as \( I \) dollars, and the amount of money Rodney has as \( R \) dollars. According to the problem, Jessica has 100 dollars, so Jessica's amount of money is \( J = 100 \) dollars.

We are given that Ian has half as much money as Jessica, so we can write:
\[ I = \frac{1}{2}J = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

We are also given that Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian, so we can write:
\[ R = I + 35 = 50 + 35 = 85 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more money Jessica has than Rodney, we subtract Rodney's amount of money from Jessica's amount:
\[ J - R = 100 - 85 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jessica has 15 dollars more than Rodney.

Let's denote the amount of money Ian has as \( I \) and Jessica has as \( J \). We are given that \( J = 100 \) dollars. Additionally, we know that Ian has half as much money as Jessica, so we can write:

\[ I = \frac{1}{2}J \]
\[ I = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Rodney has $35 more than Ian, so we can denote the amount of money Rodney has as \( R \):

\[ R = I + 35 \]
\[ R = 50 + 35 = 85 \text{ dollars} \]

Now we need to find out how much more money Jessica has than Rodney. Since Jessica has $100 and Rodney has $85, the difference between Jessica and Rodney's money is:

\[ J - R = 100 - 85 = 15 \]

So, Jessica has $15 more than Rodney.

Let's denote the amount of money Ian has as \( I \), the amount Rodney has as \( R \), and the amount Jessica has as \( J \).

We know that Jessica has $100:\[ J = 100 \]

We also know that Ian has half as much money as Jessica has:\[ I = \frac{1}{2}J \] Substituting the value of \( J \) from the Jessica amount:\[ I = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \] \[ I = 50 \]

Now we know that Rodney has $35 more than Ian:\[ R = I + 35 \]

Substituting the value of \( I \) in the equation above:\[ R = 50 + 35 \]

So Rodney has \( 50 + 35 = 85 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Jessica has than Rodney, we subtract Rodney's money from Jessica's amount:\[ B = J - R \]

Substituting the values of \( J \) and \( R \) from above:\[ B = 100 - 85 \]

So Jessica has \( 100 - 85 = 15 \) dollars more than Rodney.

To solve this problem, we will first find out how much money Ian has, and then determine how much money Rodney has. Lastly, we'll compare Jessica's money to find the difference between her and Rodney's money.

1. Jessica has $100.

2. Ian has half as much money as Jessica, so:
   Ian's money = 1/2 * Jessica's money
   Ian's money = 1/2 * 100
   Ian's money = 50 dollars

3. Rodney has $35 more than Ian, so:
   Rodney's money = Ian's money + 35
   Rodney's money = 50 + 35
   Rodney's money = 85 dollars

4. Now, we compare Jessica's money to Rodney's money:
   Jessica's money - Rodney's money = 100 - 85 = 15 dollars

Therefore, Jessica has $15 more than Rodney.
