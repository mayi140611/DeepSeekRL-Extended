###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Kurt's old refrigerator cost $0.85 a day in electricity.  He recently bought a new energy-efficient refrigerator that only cost $0.45 a day in electricity.  How much money does Kurt save in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator?

system
To calculate the savings, we first need to determine the daily cost of electricity for both the old and new refrigerators.

For the old refrigerator:
Cost per day = $0.85

For the new refrigerator:
Cost per day = $0.45

The savings per day can be calculated by subtracting the cost of the new refrigerator from the cost of the old refrigerator.

Savings per day = Cost of old refrigerator - Cost of new refrigerator
Savings per day = $0.85 - $0.45
Savings per day = $0.40

Now, to find the total savings for a 30-day month, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in the month.

Total savings = Savings per day × Number of days in the month
Total savings = $0.40 × 30
Total savings = $12

Therefore, Kurt saves $12 in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator.

To determine how much money Kurt saves in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator, we first need to calculate the daily savings and then multiply that by the number of days in a month.

1. Calculate the daily savings:
\[ \text{Daily savings} = \text{Cost of old refrigerator} - \text{Cost of new refrigerator} = 0.85 - 0.45 = 0.40 \]

2. Calculate the total savings for a 30-day month:
\[ \text{Total savings} = \text{Daily savings} \times \text{Number of days in a month} = 0.40 \times 30 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Kurt saves $12 in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator.

First, find the daily savings:
\[
\text{Daily savings} = \text{Cost of old refrigerator} - \text{Cost of new refrigerator}

\[
\text{Daily savings} = 0.85 - 0.45 = 0.40 \text{ dollars}

Next, calculate the total savings over 30 days:
\[
\text{Total savings} = \text{Daily savings} \times \text{Number of days}

\[
\text{Total savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars}

Kurt's old refrigerator costs $0.85 per day, and his new refrigerator costs $0.45 per day. The daily savings is:
\[

To calculate the savings, we need to subtract the cost of the new refrigerator from the cost of the old refrigerator over the course of a month. The cost of the old refrigerator for a month is $0.85 x 30 = $25.50. The cost of the new refrigerator for a month is $0.45 x 30 = $13.50. Therefore, the savings is $25.50 - $13.50 = $12.

To determine how much money Kurt saves in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings by subtracting the cost of the new refrigerator from the cost of the old refrigerator.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a month (30 days) to get the total savings for the month.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Daily savings:
\[ \text{New refrigerator cost} - \text{Old refrigerator cost} = 0.45 - 0.85 = -0.40 \]

It seems there was a mistake in setting up the problem. The cost of the new refrigerator is actually higher than the old one, which means Kurt would actually be spending more on electricity with his new refrigerator.

The correct calculation should be:
\[ \text{New refrigerator cost} - \text{Old refrigerator cost} = 0.85 - 0.45 = 0.40 \]
So, Kurt is saving $0.40 per day with his new refrigerator.

2. Monthly savings:
\[ \text{Daily savings} \times \text{Number of days in a month} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Kurt saves $12 in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator.

To calculate how much money Kurt saves in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator, we first need to find out how much money he spends on electricity with his old refrigerator and how much he spends with his new refrigerator.

With his old refrigerator, Kurt spends $0.85 per day, so for 30 days, the total cost is:
\[ 0.85 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 25.5 \, \text{dollars} \]

With his new refrigerator, Kurt spends $0.45 per day, so for 30 days, the total cost is:
\[ 0.45 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 13.5 \, \text{dollars} \]

The amount of money Kurt saves is the difference between the cost of electricity with his old refrigerator and the cost with his new refrigerator:
\[ 25.5 \, \text{dollars} - 13.5 \, \text{dollars} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, Kurt saves $12 in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator.

To calculate how much money Kurt saves in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator, we first need to find out how much he spends on electricity with his old refrigerator and how much he spends with his new refrigerator over those 30 days.

With his old refrigerator, he spends $0.85 per day on electricity. Over 30 days, the total cost is:
\[
0.85 \text{ dollars/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 25.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

With his new refrigerator, he spends $0.45 per day on electricity. Over 30 days, the total cost is:
\[
0.45 \text{ dollars/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 13.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

The money saved in a 30-day month is the difference between what he spends with the old refrigerator and what he spends with the new refrigerator:
\[
25.50 \text{ dollars} - 13.50 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Kurt saves $12.00 in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator.

To determine how much money Kurt saves with his new refrigerator, we first calculate the daily cost difference between his old and new refrigerators.

The daily cost of the old refrigerator is $0.85.
The daily cost of the new refrigerator is $0.45.

The difference in daily cost is:
\[ 0.85 - 0.45 \]

Calculating the difference:
\[ 0.85 - 0.45 = 0.40 \]

This means the new refrigerator costs $0.40 less per day than the old refrigerator.

Next, we need to find out how much money the difference amounts to over a 30-day month. We multiply the daily cost difference by the number of days in the month:
\[ 0.40 \times 30 \]

Calculating the total savings:
\[ 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Kurt saves $12 in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator.

Reasoning:

First, calculate the daily electricity cost savings by subtracting the cost of the new refrigerator from the cost of the old refrigerator:

$0.85 (old refrigerator cost) - $0.45 (new refrigerator cost) = $0.40 daily savings

Next, calculate the total monthly savings by multiplying the daily savings by the number of days in a month (30):

$0.40 daily savings × 30 days = $12 monthly savings

Therefore, Kurt saves $12 in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator.
