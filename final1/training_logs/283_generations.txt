Lily sells the first ticket for $1, the second for $2, the third for $3, the fourth for $4, and the fifth for $5. This gives a total of $1 + $2 + $3 + $4 + $5 = $15.

She wants to keep a $4 profit, so the prize money will be $15 - $4 = $11.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####

system
Lily sells the first ticket for $1. Each successive ticket is sold for $1 more than the previous ticket. 
For the second ticket, she sells it for $1 + $1 = $2.
For the third ticket, she sells it for $2 + $1 = $3.
For the fourth ticket, she sells it for $3 + $1 = $4.
For the fifth ticket, she sells it for $4 + $1 = $5.
She keeps a $4 profit, so the total amount of money she makes from selling the 5 tickets is $1 + $2 + $3 + $4 + $5 = $15.
The prize money is the total amount of money Lily makes minus her $4 profit, which is $15 - $4 = $11.
Therefore, the winner of the lottery will receive $11.

system
To determine the total money Lily receives in total (including her profit), we first need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the tickets.

The price of the tickets increases by $1 for each successive ticket. So, the prices of the tickets are:
- 1st ticket: $1
- 2nd ticket: $1 + $1 = $2
- 3rd ticket: $2 + $1 = $3
- 4th ticket: $3 + $1 = $4
- 5th ticket: $4 + $1 = $5

The total revenue from selling all 5 tickets is the sum of these prices:
\[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\]

Lily plans to keep a $4 profit. Therefore, the total money she will give as a prize is:
\[15 - 4 = 11\]

Thus, the winner of the lottery will receive $11.
