system
Let's denote the number of votes for the witch cake as \( W \).

Given:
- The number of votes for the witch cake (\( W \)) is 7.
- The number of votes for the unicorn cake (\( U \)) is three times the number of votes for the witch cake. Thus, \( U = 3W \).
- The number of votes for the dragon cake (\( D \)) is 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake. Thus, \( D = W + 25 \).

First, we calculate the votes for the unicorn cake:
\[
U = 3W = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

Next, we calculate the votes for the dragon cake:
\[
D = W + 25 = 7 + 25 = 32
\]

To find the total number of votes cast, we sum up the votes for all three cakes:
\[
W + U + D = W + 21 + 32 = 7 + 21 + 32
\]

Adding these together:
\[
7 + 21 = 28
\]
\[
28 + 32 = 60
\]

Thus, the total number of votes cast is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]

Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that 7 people voted for the witch cake.
2. The number of votes for the dragon cake was 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake. So, for the witch cake, it's 7, so for the dragon cake it's 7 + 25 = 32 votes.
3. The number of votes for the unicorn cake is three times as many as for the witch cake. So, 3 times 7 = 21 votes for the unicorn cake.
4. Now we add up the votes for all three cakes:
   - Witch cake: 7 votes
   - Dragon cake: 32 votes
   - Unicorn cake: 21 votes
   7 + 32 + 21 = 60 votes total.

Therefore, the total number of votes cast is 60.

Since the number of votes for the unicorn cake was three times the number of votes for the witch cake, and 7 people voted for the witch cake, the number of votes for the unicorn cake was:

\( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) votes.

The number of votes for the dragon cake was 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake, so:

\( 7 + 25 = 32 \) votes.

The total number of votes cast for the three cakes is the sum of the votes for the witch, unicorn, and dragon cakes:

\( 7 + 21 + 32 = 60 \).

Let's denote the number of votes for the witch cake as \( W \). According to the problem, \( W = 7 \).

The number of votes for the unicorn cake is three times the number of votes for the witch cake, so we denote it as \( U = 3W \).

The number of votes for the dragon cake is 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake, so we denote it as \( D = W + 25 \).

We already know that \( W = 7 \), so we can substitute this into the equations for \( U \) and \( D \):

\( U = 3 \times 7 = 21 \)
\( D = 7 + 25 = 32 \)

To find the total number of votes cast, we sum the votes for all three cakes:

\( Total = W + U + D = 7 + 21 + 32 = 60 \)

So, the total number of votes cast is 60.

3. The number of votes for the dragon cake is 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake.
   \[
   \text{Dragon cake votes} = \text{Witch cake votes} + 25 = 7 + 25 = 32
   \]

4. To find the total number of votes, we sum up the votes for all the cakes.
   \[
   \text{Total votes} = \text{Witch cake votes} + \text{Unicorn cake votes} + \text{Dragon cake votes}

Let's denote the number of votes for the witch cake as \( W \). According to the problem, \( W = 7 \).

Since three times as many people voted for the unicorn cake compared to the witch cake, we can denote the number of votes for the unicorn cake as \( U = 3W \). Substituting the value of \( W \):

\[ U = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

The number of votes for the dragon cake was 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake, so we can denote the number of votes for the dragon cake as \( D = W + 25 \). Substituting the value of \( W \):

\[ D = 7 + 25 = 32 \]

Now, to find the total number of votes cast, we sum the votes for all three items:

\[ Total = W + U + D = 7 + 21 + 32 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of votes cast was 60.

Let's denote the number of votes for the witch cake as \( W \). According to the problem, \( W = 7 \).

The number of votes for the unicorn cake (U) is three times the number of votes for the witch cake, so \( U = 3W \). Substituting \( W = 7 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ U = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

The number of votes for the dragon cake (D) is 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake, so \( D = W + 25 \). Substituting \( W = 7 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ D = 7 + 25 = 32 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of votes cast. The total number of votes \( T \) is the sum of the votes for the witch cake, the unicorn cake, and the dragon cake:
\[ T = W + U + D = 7 + 21 + 32 = 60 \]

So, the total number of votes cast is:

We know that the number of votes for the unicorn cake is three times the number of votes for the witch cake. Therefore:
\[
\text{Votes for the unicorn cake} = 3W

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[
\text{Votes for the unicorn cake} = 3 \times 7 = 21

1. We start by noting that 7 people voted for the witch cake. Let's denote the number of votes for the witch cake as \( W \). So, \( W = 7 \).

2. The number of votes for the unicorn cake is three times the number of votes for the witch cake. Therefore, let's denote the number of votes for the unicorn cake as \( U \). According to the problem, \( U = 3 \times W = 3 \times 7 \). This gives us \( U = 21 \).

3. The number of votes for the dragon cake is 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake. Let's denote the number of votes for the dragon cake as \( D \). According to the problem, \( D = W + 25 \). Since \( W = 7 \), we get \( D = 7 + 25 \), which gives us \( D = 32 \).

4. To find the total number of votes cast, we add the votes for all three cakes: \( W + U + D = 7 + 21 + 32 \).

5. Performing the addition, we get \( 7 + 21 + 32 = 60 \).

Let's denote the number of votes for the witch cake as \( W \). According to the problem, \( W = 7 \).

The number of votes for the unicorn cake is three times that of the witch cake, so it can be represented as \( 3W \).

The number of votes for the dragon cake is 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake, so it can be represented as \( W + 25 \).

Now, let's calculate the total votes. The total votes \( T \) is the sum of the votes for the witch cake, the unicorn cake, and the dragon cake:

\[
T = W + 3W + (W + 25)
\]

Substituting \( W = 7 \) into the equation:

\[
T = 7 + 3(7) + (7 + 25)

\[
T = 7 + 21 + 32

\[
T = 60

Let's denote the number of votes for the witch cake as \( W \), the number of votes for the dragon cake as \( D \), and the number of votes for the unicorn cake as \( U \).

We are given:
1. The number of votes for the unicorn cake is three times the number of votes for the witch cake:
\[ U = 3W \]
2. The number of votes for the unicorn cake is 25 more than the number of votes for the dragon cake:
\[ U = D + 25 \]
3. The number of votes for the witch cake is 7:
\[ W = 7 \]

First, let's use the first condition to find the number of votes for the unicorn cake:
\[ U = 3W \]
Since \( W = 7 \),
\[ U = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, let's use the second condition to find the number of votes for the dragon cake:
\[ U = D + 25 \]
Since \( U = 21 \),
\[ 21 = D + 25 \]
Solving for \( D \),
\[ D = 21 - 25 = -4 \]

However, the number of votes for the dragon cake cannot be negative. This indicates an inconsistency in the problem's conditions or data provided. Given the information, we cannot determine the number of votes for the dragon cake as per the provided constraints.

Since the problem does not provide consistent data for the numbers of votes for the witch and unicorn cakes, we cannot accurately calculate the total number of votes cast. Therefore, the problem as stated does not have a valid solution.

Answer:
The total number of votes cannot be calculated with the given data due to an inconsistency.
