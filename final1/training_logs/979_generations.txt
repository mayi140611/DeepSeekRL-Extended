<reasoning>
To find the total number of koalas and kangaroos at Legoland, we first need to determine how many koalas there are. Since there are 5 kangaroos for each koala and Legoland has 180 kangaroos, we can calculate the number of koalas as follows:
\[ \text{Number of koalas} = \frac{\text{Number of kangaroos}}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]
Now that we know there are 36 koalas, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of kangaroos and koalas together:
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = \text{Number of kangaroos} + \text{Number of koalas} = 180 + 36 = 216 \]

Let's denote the number of koalas by \( k \). According to the problem, there are 5 kangaroos for each koala. Therefore, if there are \( k \) koalas, there are \( 5k \) kangaroos.

We are given that the total number of kangaroos and koalas combined is 180. This gives us the equation:
\[ 5k + k = 180 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6k = 180 \]
To find \( k \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ k = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]
So, there are 30 koalas.

The total number of koalas and kangaroos is:
\[ k + 5k = 30 + 150 = 180 \]

Therefore, the number of koalas is 30 and the number of kangaroos is 150, giving a total of 180 animals.
</reasoning>
<answer>
30, 150
</answer>
The answer is 30 koalas and 150 kangaroos altogether.

To find out how many koalas are there, we can use the given ratio of kangaroos to koalas, which is 5 kangaroos for each koala. If Legoland has 180 kangaroos, we can divide this number by the ratio to find the number of koalas.

Number of koalas = Number of kangaroos / Ratio
Number of koalas = 180 / 5 = 36 koalas

Now, to find the total number of kangaroos and koalas altogether, we add the number of kangaroos to the number of koalas:

Total number of kangaroos and koalas = Number of kangaroos + Number of koalas
Total number of kangaroos and koalas = 180 + 36 = 216

So, there are 216 kangaroos and koalas altogether.

Let's denote the number of koalas as \( k \) and the number of kangaroos as \( g \).

According to the given information:
1. The ratio of kangaroos to koalas is 5:1.
   This means for every 5 kangaroos, there is 1 koala.

We are told that there are 180 kangaroos, so \( g = 180 \).

From the ratio, we can deduce the number of koalas:
- Since 5 kangaroos correspond to 1 koala, \( k = \frac{g}{5} \).

Now, substitute the number of kangaroos (180) into the equation:
\[ k = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

So we have found that there are 36 koalas.

To find the total number of animals in Legoland, we sum the number of kangaroos and koalas:
\[ \text{Total} = k + g = 36 + 180 = 216 \]

Therefore, there are 216 koalas and kangaroos altogether.

To determine the total number of koalas and kangaroos at Legoland, we start by understanding the relationship between the number of kangaroos and koalas. According to the information given, there are 5 kangaroos for each koala. 

Let's denote the number of koalas as \( k \). Since there are 5 kangaroos for each koala, the total number of kangaroos can be represented as \( 5k \).

Given that the total number of kangaroos is 180, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 5k = 180 \]

To find the value of \( k \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ k = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

So, there are 36 koalas at Legoland.

Next, we calculate the total number of animals (koalas and kangaroos) by adding the number of koalas to the number of kangaroos:
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 36 \text{ koalas} + 180 \text{ kangaroos} = 216 \]

Therefore, the total number of koalas and kangaroos at Legoland is 216.

To determine the total number of koalas and kangaroos at Legoland, we start by noting the ratio of kangaroos to koalas, which is 5:1. This means that for every 6 animals (5 kangaroos and 1 koala), one is a koala.

Legoland has 180 kangaroos. To find out how many groups of 6 animals (5 kangaroos and 1 koala) are in 180 kangaroos, we divide 180 by 6:

\[ 180 \div 6 = 30 \]

This means there are 30 groups of 6 animals, and each group consists of 1 koala. Therefore, there are 30 koalas.

To find the total number of koalas and kangaroos combined, we add the number of koalas to the number of kangaroos:

\[ 30 \text{ koalas} + 180 \text{ kangaroos} = 210 \]

So, there are 210 koalas and kangaroos altogether.

Legoland has 5 kangaroos for each koala. If Legoland has 180 kangaroos, we can find the number of koalas by dividing the total number of kangaroos by 5.

Number of koalas = Total number of kangaroos / 5
Number of koalas = 180 / 5

Now, we calculate the number of koalas:

Number of koalas = 36

To find the total number of animals (koalas and kangaroos) together, we add the number of koalas and the number of kangaroos:

Total number of animals = Number of koalas + Number of kangaroos
Total number of animals = 36 + 180

Now, we calculate the total number of animals:

Total number of animals = 216

Therefore, there are 216 koalas and kangaroos altogether.

Legoland has 5 kangaroos for each koala. If Legoland has 180 kangaroos, we can set up the equation for the number of koalas:
\[ 5 \text{ kangaroos per koala} \times \text{number of koalas} = 180 \text{ kangaroos} \]

To find out the number of koalas, we divide the total number of kangaroos by 5:

To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio between kangaroos and koalas at Legoland, which is 5 kangaroos for every 1 koala.

The number of kangaroos is provided as 180. 

Let's denote the number of koalas by \( x \). According to the ratio, \( 5 \) kangaroos are equivalent to \( 1 \) koala. Thus, we can write the following equation to represent the number of koalas compared to kangaroos:

\[ 5 \times x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{180}{5} \]

\[ x = 36 \]

So, there are 36 koalas.

To find the total number of koalas and kangaroos together, we add the number of koalas and kangaroos:

\[ 36 \text{ koalas} + 180 \text{ kangaroos} = 216 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 216 kangaroos and koalas at Legoland.

Let's denote the number of koalas as \( k \). According to the problem, there are 5 kangaroos for each koala. So we can write the relationship between the number of kangaroos and koalas as:
\[ \text{Number of kangaroos} = 5k \]

We are given that there are 180 kangaroos. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 5k = 180 \]

To find \( k \), we solve for \( k \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ k = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

So there are 36 koalas.

Now, to find the total number of kangaroos and koalas together, we add the number of kangaroos and koalas:
\[ \text{Total} = 180 + 36 = 216 \]

Therefore, the total number of kangaroos and koalas together is 216.

To find the total number of koalas and kangaroos at Legoland, we start by determining the number of koalas. According to the problem, the number of kangaroos is 5 times the number of koalas. Given that there are 180 kangaroos, we can set up the equation:

\( 5 \times \text{koalas} = 180 \)

By solving for the number of koalas, we first divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\( \text{koalas} = \frac{180}{5} \)

\( \text{koalas} = 36 \)

Now that we know there are 36 koalas, we can calculate the total number of animals by adding the number of kangaroos and koalas together:

\( \text{total} = \text{kangaroos} + \text{koalas} \)

\( \text{total} = 180 + 36 \)

\( \text{total} = 216 \)

So, there are 216 koalas and kangaroos altogether.
