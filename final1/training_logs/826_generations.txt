<reasoning>
Let's break down the information given:
1. Forty percent of students are learning from home.
2. The remaining (100% - 40% = 60%) of students are divided into two equal groups, each with the same number of students.
3. Only one of these two groups is physically in school on any given day.

Since the remaining students are divided into two equal groups, each group represents 30% of the total student population (because 60% / 2 = 30%).

Because only one group is physically in school on any day, the percentage of students present in school is 30%.

Therefore, the percentage of students present in school is 30%.

First, let's determine the percentage of students who are not learning from home. This would be 100% - 40% = 60%.

The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, meaning each group consists of 60% / 2 = 30%.

Since only one of these two groups is physically in school on any given day, the percentage of students present in school is 30%.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \).

First, we know that 40% of the students are learning from home:
\[ 0.40N \]

This means that the remaining 60% of the students are present in school:
\[ N - 0.40N = 0.60N \]

The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, meaning each group represents half of the school population:
\[ \frac{0.60N}{2} = 0.30N \]

Therefore, the percent of students that are present in school is:
\[ 0.30N \div N \times 100\% = 30\% \]

So, 30% of the students are present in school on any given day.

Let's denote the total number of students as $T$. According to the problem, 40% of the students are learning from home, which means that $0.40T$ students are away from school.

The remaining students are $0.60T$, because $100\% - 40\% = 60\%$. These remaining students are divided into two equal groups. 

Since only one group is physically in school on any given day, both groups must consist of half of the remaining students. Therefore, the number of students in the school on any given day is $0.30T$ (half of $0.60T$).

To find the percentage of students present in school, we calculate the ratio of students in school to the total number of students and then convert it to a percentage:

$$
\text{Percentage in school} = \frac{0.30T}{T} \times 100\% = 30\%
$$

So, 30% of the students are present in school on any given day.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( S \).

First, we calculate the number of students who are learning from home. This is given by:
\[ 0.4S \]

The remaining students are:
\[ S - 0.4S = 0.6S \]

These remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group has:
\[ \frac{0.6S}{2} = 0.3S \]

Only one of these groups is physically in school on any given day, so the number of students present in school is:
\[ 0.3S \]

To find what percent of the total students are present in school, we calculate:
\[ \frac{0.3S}{S} \times 100\% = 30\% \]

So, 30% of the students are present in school.

Let's denote the total number of students by \( T \). According to the problem, 40% of the students are learning from home, so the number of students learning from home is \( 0.4T \). This leaves \( T - 0.4T = 0.6T \) students who are physically present in school.

The remaining 30% of students who are physically present in school are divided into two equal groups. Therefore, each of these groups has \( \frac{0.3T}{2} = 0.15T \) students.

The number of students present in school is the sum of the students from both groups: \( 0.15T + 0.15T = 0.3T \).

To find the percentage of students present in school, we divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and then multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{0.3T}{T} \times 100 = 30\%
\]

So, the percentage of students present in school is 30%.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( S \).

40% of the students are learning from home, so \( 0.40 \times S \) students are at home. The remaining students are \( S - 0.40S = 0.60S \).

These remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group is \( \frac{0.60S}{2} = 0.30S \).

Only one of these groups is physically in school, so the number of students present in school is \( 0.30S \).

To find the percentage of students present in school, we divide the number of students in school by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{0.30S}{S} \times 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30\% \]

Given that 40% of the students are learning from home, this means that the remaining 60% of the students are divided into two equal groups. Since only one out of these two groups is physically in school on any given day, the students who are present in school are one half of the 60% who are supposed to be present.

\[ \text{Percentage of students present in school} = \frac{\text{Percentage of students out of school}}{2} = \frac{60\%}{2} = 30\% \]

So, the percentage of students present in school is \(30\%\).

We know that 40% of students are learning from home, which means that \(100\% - 40\% = 60\%\) of students are present in school. Out of these 60%, only one group is physically in school. This means that the remaining 59% of the students present in school are the other group.

So, we need to find out what 59% of 60% is:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 60\% = \frac{59}{100} \times 60\% = 0.59 \times 0.60 = 0.354 = 35.4\% \]

Therefore, the 59% of the students who are present in school represent 35.4% of all students.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( S \). 

First, we note that 40% of students are learning from home, which means 60% of students are not learning from home. These 60% of students are divided into two equal groups, meaning \( \frac{60}{2} = 30\% \) of these students are present in school.

So, \( 0.3S \) of the students are in school.

Since \( \frac{30}{100} \) of the remaining students are in school, we calculate:
\[ \frac{30}{100} \times 60\% = 0.3 \times 0.6 = 0.18 \]
\[ \frac{30}{100} \times 60 = 18\% \]
\[ \frac{30}{200} = 18\% \]

Adding these percentages together, we get:
\[ 40\% (home) + 18\% (in school) = 58\% \]

So, the students actually present in school is 18%.

To determine the percentage of students present in school, let's first understand the distribution of students.

Given:
- 40% of students learn from home.
- 60% of students are not learning from home (remaining students).

The 60% of students who are not learning from home are divided into two equal groups, and only one of these groups is physically in school on any given day.

Since only one of the two groups is present in school, this means that only half of the remaining students are physically in school on any given day.

Now, we calculate the percentage of these remaining students who are present in school:
\[ 60\% \div 2 = 30\% \]

Therefore, 30% of the students are present in school on any given day.

To determine the percentage of students present in school, we first need to calculate the percentage of students who are physically present.

First, we know that 40% of the students are learning from home, so this means that 60% of the students are participating in physical classes (since the sum of these two groups equals 100%).

The remaining 60% of the students are divided into two equal groups, meaning that half of these 60% are in school on any given day. Therefore, the percentage of students present in school is 30% (half of 60%).

So, the percentage of students present in school is 30%.

To find out what percent of students are present in school, we start by determining the percentage of students who are not learning from home. Since forty percent of students are learning from home, the remaining percentage, who are not, is calculated as follows: 
\( 100\% - 40\% = 60\% \)

From these non-home learners, only one half attend school on any given day. To find out the percentage of non-home learners that attend school, we take the 60% and divide it by 2 to get half of it:
\( \frac{1}{2} \times 60\% = 30\% \)

So, 30 percent of students are present in school.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \). Forty percent of the students have elected to learn from home, so the number of students learning from home is \( 0.4N \). The remaining students are \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

These remaining students are divided into two equal groups, and only one of these groups is present in school on any given day. Therefore, the number of students present in school is half of the remaining students, which is \( \frac{0.6N}{2} = 0.3N \).

To find the percentage of students present in school, we divide the number of students present by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
\[
\text{Percentage of students present} = \left( \frac{0.3N}{N} \right) \times 100 = 0.3 \times 100 = 30\%

So, 30% of the students are present in school on any given day.
