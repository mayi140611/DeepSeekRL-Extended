Cadence worked at her old company for 3 years, which is equivalent to 36 months. She earned $5000 per month at the old company. 

Let \( L \) be the time Cadence worked at the old company in months. Therefore:
\[ L = 36 \]

Her earnings from the old company can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total earnings from old company} = 5000 \times L = 5000 \times 36 = 180000 \]

At the new company, she earns 20% more. So her monthly earnings at the new company are:
\[ 5000 \times 1.20 = 6000 \]

Let \( D \) be the time Cadence worked at the new company in months. We know that she worked for 5 months longer at the new company than at the old company. Therefore:
\[ D = L + 5 = 36 + 5 = 41 \]

Her earnings from the new company can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total earnings from new company} = 6000 \times D = 6000 \times 41 = 246000 \]

So the total amount of money she earned in both companies is:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 180000 + 246000 = 426000 \]

First, we need to calculate the total earning of Cadence from her old company. Since she worked there for 3 years and earned $5000 per month, we can calculate the total earnings as follows:

Total earnings from old company = 3 years * 12 months/year * $5000/month

Now, we need to determine the number of months she worked for her new company. Since she worked five months longer for the new company than the old company, and the old company took 3 years, the new company took 3 years + 5 months = 3 years and 5 months. Convert 3 years and 5 months to months: 3 years * 12 months/year + 5 months = 36 months + 5 months = 41 months.

Now, we need to calculate her earnings from the new company. She is earning 20% more than her old salary, so her new salary is 1.20 times $5000.

New salary = $5000 * 1.20 = $6000 per month.

Now we can calculate her total earnings from the new company:

Total earnings from new company = 41 months * $6000/month.

Finally, we can calculate the total earnings from both companies:

Total earnings = Total earnings from old company + Total earnings from new company.

We put these calculations together to get the total amount of money she's earned in both companies in the period she's worked for them.

First, we need to calculate the total earnings at the old company. Cadence has worked for her old company for 3 years, which is equivalent to \(3 \times 12 = 36\) months. She earns $5000 per month, so her earnings at the old company are \(36 \times 5000 = 180000\) dollars. 

Next, we calculate her working period in the new company. She has worked for her new company five months longer than her old company, so she has worked for \(36 + 5 = 41\) months in the new company. She is now earning 20% more in the new company than at the old company, which means her new monthly salary is \(5000 + (0.2 \times 5000) = 5000 + 1000 = 6000\) dollars.

Her earnings at the new company for 41 months are \(41 \times 6000 = 246000\) dollars. 

To find the total amount of money she has earned in both companies in the period she has worked for them, we add her earnings from the old company and the new company, which gives us \(180000 + 246000 = 426000\) dollars.

To calculate the total amount of money Cadence has earned in both companies, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total earnings at her old company.
2. Calculate the total earnings at her new company.
3. Sum the earnings from both companies.

Step 1: Calculate the total earnings at her old company.
- She worked at her old company for 3 years.
- She earned $5000 per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so she worked for \(3 \times 12 = 36\) months.
- Her total earnings at her old company are \(36 \times 5000 = 180000\) dollars.

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings at her new company.
- Cadence has worked for her new company five months longer than her old company. Therefore, she has worked at the new company for \(36 + 5 = 41\) months.
- At her new company, she is earning 20% more than her old company's salary, which is \(5000 \times 1.20 = 6000\) dollars per month.
- Her total earnings at her new company are \(41 \times 6000 = 246000\) dollars.

Step 3: Sum the earnings from both companies.
- Her total earnings from both companies are \(180000 + 246000 = 426000\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Cadence has earned in both companies in the period she has worked for them is $426000.

Cadence worked at her old company for 3 years, so the number of months she worked there is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) months. She has worked for her new company for five months longer than at her old company, so she has worked there for \(36 + 5 = 41\) months. 

Her old company paid her $5000 per month, so in 36 months, she earned \(36 \times 5000 = \$180,000\). In her new company, she is earning 20% more per month, so her pay is \(5000 \times 1.2 = \$6000\) per month. For 41 months, she earned \(41 \times 6000 = \$246,000\).

Therefore, the total amount of money she has earned in both companies is \(180000 + 246000 = \$426,000\).

First, we need to determine how many months Cadence worked at her old company. Since she worked there for 3 years, which is equivalent to \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) months. Let \( x \) represent the number of months she's worked at her new company.

According to the problem, she has worked at her new company for five months longer than her old company:
\[
x = 36 + 5 = 41 \text{ months}
\]

Next, we calculate Cadence's monthly earnings at her old company and her new company:
\[
\text{Old Company:} \quad 36 \text{ months} \times 5000 \text{ dollars/month} = 180000 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{New Company:} \quad 41 \text{ months} \times (5000 \times 1.20) \text{ dollars/month} = 41 \text{ months} \times 6000 \text{ dollars/month} = 246000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the earnings from both companies to find her total earnings:
\[
180000 + 246000 = 426000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Cadence has earned a total of \( 426000 \) dollars.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Cadence earned from both companies over the given period.

First, we calculate the total earnings from the old company:
- Cadence worked at her old company for 3 years.
- She worked for 5 months longer in the new company, so she worked for a total of \(3 \times 12 + 5 = 37\) months in her old company.
- Her earnings from the old company are $5000 per month.

The total earnings at the old company can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Total earnings at old company} = 5000 \times 37 = 185000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from the new company:
- In the new company, she earns 20% more than what she earns at the old company. Therefore, her new salary is:
\[
\text{New salary} = 5000 \times 1.20 = 6000 \text{ dollars per month}
\]

- In the new company, she also worked for 5 months longer. So, she worked for:
\[
37 + 5 = 42 \text{ months}
\]

The total earnings at the new company can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Total earnings at new company} = 6000 \times 42 = 252000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she earned in both companies by adding the earnings from both companies:
\[
\text{Total amount earned} = 185000 + 252000 = 437000 \text{ dollars}

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Cadence earned at her old job. She worked there for 3 years, earning $5000 per month.

\[ \text{Total earnings at old job} = 3 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} \times \$5000/\text{month} = 360 \times \$5000 = \$1,800,000 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings at her new job. She is earning 20% more per month than at her old job.

\[ \text{New monthly earnings} = \$5000/\text{month} + (20\% \times \$5000/\text{month}) = \$5000 + \$1000 = \$6000/\text{month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total earnings at her new job. She has worked at her new company for five months longer than she did at her old job.

\[ \text{Total months at new job} = 5 \text{ months} + 3 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 5 + 36 = 41 \text{ months} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings at new job} = 41 \text{ months} \times \$6000/\text{month} = \$246,000 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both jobs to get the total amount of money earned in both companies over the entire period.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$1,800,000 + \$246,000 = \$2,046,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cadence has earned in both companies is \$2,046,000.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Cadence worked at her old company for 3 years (36 months).
2. In the old company, she earned $5000 per month.
3. In the new company, she earns 20% more than $5000.

First, calculate her monthly salary in the new company:
\[ \text{New company salary} = 5000 + (0.20 \times 5000) = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Since she's worked for 5 months more in the new company than in the old one, she's worked for 36 + 5 = 41 months in the new company.

Now we can calculate the total earnings for each company:
\[ \text{Earnings at old company} = 5000 \times 36 \]
\[ \text{Earnings at new company} = 6000 \times 41 \]

Finally, we sum up the total earnings from both companies:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 \times 36 + 6000 \times 41 \]

Let's perform these calculations:
\[ \text{Earnings at old company} = 5000 \times 36 = 180000 \]
\[ \text{Earnings at new company} = 6000 \times 41 = 246000 \]

Adding these together:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 180000 + 246000 = 426000 \]

So, the total amount of money she's earned in both companies is $426,000.

To calculate the total earnings, we need to determine the number of months she worked at each company and then multiply those by their respective earnings.

First, let's find out how many months she worked at her old company. Since she worked there for 3 years, and there are 12 months in a year, she worked for:
\[ 3 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 36 \text{ months} \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings at her old company. She earned $5000 per month over a period of 36 months, so:
\[ 36 \text{ months} \times \$5000/\text{month} = \$180,000 \]

Now, let's find out how many months she worked at her new company. Since she has worked for her new company 5 months longer than her old company, she worked for:
\[ 36 \text{ months} + 5 \text{ months} = 41 \text{ months} \]

Let's determine her new salary. Since she earns 20% more at her new company, her new salary is:
\[ 5000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 1.20 = \$6000 \text{ per month} \]

The total earnings at her new company will be the number of months she worked there multiplied by her new salary:
\[ 41 \text{ months} \times \$6000/\text{month} = \$246,000 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both companies to get the total amount:
\[ \$180,000 + \$246,000 = \$426,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she's earned in both companies is \$426,000.

First, let's determine the total amount of money Cadence earned in her old company. She worked there for 3 years, and that's a total of \(3 \times 12 = 36\) months. At $5000 per month, her total earnings there were \(36 \times 5000 = 180000\) dollars.

Next, let's determine the monthly earnings at the new company. She's earning 20% more than she did at her old company, so her old monthly salary of $5000 is increased by \(5000 \times 0.20 = 1000\) dollars per month. Thus, her new salary is \(5000 + 1000 = 6000\) dollars per month.

Since she has worked for the new company for 5 months longer than her old company, she has worked there for \(36 + 5 = 41\) months. Consequently, her total earnings at the new company will be \(41 \times 6000 = 246000\) dollars.
