#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote Milford's current age as \( M \) and Eustace's current age as \( E \).

From the information given, we have two equations:
1. Eustace is twice as old as Milford: \( E = 2M \)
2. In 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old: \( E + 3 = 39 \)

From the second equation, we can solve for Eustace's current age:
\[ E + 3 = 39 \]
\[ E = 39 - 3 \]
\[ E = 36 \]

Now, using the first equation, we can solve for Milford's current age:
\[ E = 2M \]
\[ 36 = 2M \]
\[ M = \frac{36}{2} \]
\[ M = 18 \]

So, Milford is currently 18 years old.

To find out how old Milford will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ M_{\text{in 3 years}} = M + 3 \]
\[ M_{\text{in 3 years}} = 18 + 3 \]
\[ M_{\text{in 3 years}} = 21 \]

Therefore, in 3 years, Milford will be 21 years old.

Let's first find out how old Eustace is currently. If in 3 years he will be 39, then Eustace's current age is \(39 - 3 = 36\) years.

Since Eustace is twice as old as Milford, we can set up the equation to find Milford's current age: \(2 \times \text{Milford's current age} = 36\).

Solving for Milford's current age:
\[
\text{Milford's current age} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ years old}
\]

In 3 years, Milford will be \(18 + 3 = 21\) years old.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####

system
To determine Milford's current age, we start by calculating Eustace's current age. We know that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old. Therefore, his current age is:

\[ 39 - 3 = 36 \]

Since Eustace is twice as old as Milford, we can express Milford's current age as:

\[ \text{Milford's age} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how old Milford will be in 3 years. Since Milford is currently 18 years old, in 3 years he will be:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, Milford will be 21 years old in 3 years.

If Eustace will be 39 in 3 years, then currently he is \(39 - 3 = 36\) years old. 

Eustace is twice as old as Milford, so if Eustace is 36 years old, Milford is \(36 / 2 = 18\) years old.

In 3 years, Milford will be \(18 + 3 = 21\) years old.

To find out how old Milford will be in 3 years, we first need to determine Eustace's current age.

Given that Eustace will be 39 in 3 years, we can calculate his current age by subtracting 3 from 39:
\[ \text{Eustace's current age} = 39 - 3 = 36 \]

According to the problem, Eustace is twice as old as Milford. If Eustace is 36 years old, then Milford's current age can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Milford's current age} = \frac{\text{Eustace's current age}}{2} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Now, if we want to find out how old Milford will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ \text{Milford's age in 3 years} = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, Milford will be 21 years old in 3 years.

Let's break it down:

1. We know that Eustace will be 39 in 3 years, so currently Eustace's age is 39 - 3 = 36.
2. We know that Eustace is twice as old as Milford, so Milford's current age is Eustace's age divided by 2.
3. Mathematically, Milford's current age = Eustace's current age / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18 years old.
4. In 3 years, Milford's age will be his current age plus 3, so Milford's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21.

Hence, Milford will be 21 years old in 3 years.

To solve this problem, let's follow the given steps:

1. First, let's denote Eustace's current age as \( E \) and Milford's current age as \( M \).

2. According to the information given, Eustace is twice as old as Milford:
\[ E = 2M \]

3. We are also told that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old:
\[ E + 3 = 39 \]

4. From the information in step 3, we can solve for Eustace's current age:
\[ E = 39 - 3 \]
\[ E = 36 \]

5. Now that we know Eustace's current age, we can substitute \( E \) in the first equation \( E = 2M \) to find Milford's current age:
\[ 36 = 2M \]
\[ M = \frac{36}{2} \]
\[ M = 18 \]

6. Finally, to find out how old Milford will be in 3 years, we add 3 to Milford's current age:
\[ M + 3 = 18 + 3 \]
\[ M + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, Milford will be 21 years old in 3 years.

Let's denote Milford's current age as \( M \).
According to the problem, Eustace is twice as old as Milford, so Eustace's current age is \( 2M \).

In 3 years, Eustace's age will be \( 2M + 3 \) and it is given that he will be 39 in 3 years. So, we have:

\[ 2M + 3 = 39 \]

Let's solve this equation to find \( M \):

\[ 2M = 39 - 3 \]
\[ 2M = 36 \]
\[ M = 18 \]

So, Milford is currently 18 years old.

To find Milford's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, Milford will be 21 years old in 3 years.

Now, let's answer the question directly:

Eustace will be 39 in 3 years, and Milford is 18 years old now. So, in 3 years, Milford will be:

Let's denote Milford's current age as \( M \) and Eustace's current age as \( E \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Eustace is twice as old as Milford: \( E = 2M \)
2. In 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old: \( E + 3 = 39 \)

First, we solve for Eustace's current age using the second piece of information:
\[ E + 3 = 39 \]
Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate \( E \):
\[ E = 39 - 3 \]
\[ E = 36 \]

Now we know Eustace's current age is 36. Using the first piece of information, we substitute \( E \) into the equation \( E = 2M \):
\[ 36 = 2M \]

To find Milford's current age \( M \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = \frac{36}{2} \]
\[ M = 18 \]

Milford is currently 18 years old. In 3 years, Milford will be:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, Milford will be 21 years old in 3 years.

Let's denote Milford's current age as \( M \) and Eustace's current age as \( E \). According to the problem, Eustace is twice as old as Milford, so we can write:
\[ E = 2M \]

In 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old. Therefore, in 3 years, Eustace's age can be expressed as:
\[ E + 3 = 39 \]
Substituting \( E = 2M \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2M + 3 = 39 \]
To find \( M \), we need to isolate it by first subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2M = 36 \]
Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 18 \]
So, Milford is currently 18 years old. To find out how old Milford will be in 3 years, we add 3 to Milford's current age:
\[ M + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]
Therefore, in 3 years, Milford will be 21 years old.
