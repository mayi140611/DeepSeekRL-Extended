First, we calculate the total amount of money Hannah earned from selling cookies:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.8 \text{ per cookie} = \$32. \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Hannah earned from selling cupcakes:
\[ 30 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2 \text{ per cupcake} = \$60. \]

Now, we add the amounts from selling cookies and cupcakes to find the total amount of money:
\[ \$32 + \$60 = \$92. \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of money spent on buying measuring spoons:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times \$6.5 \text{ per set} = \$13. \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent on measuring spoons from the total amount of money Hannah initially had:
\[ \$92 - \$13 = \$79. \]

Hannah sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each, which is a total of \(40 \times 0.8 = \$32\). She also sold 30 cupcakes for $2 each, which is a total of \(30 \times 2 = \$60\). The total money she made is \(32 + 60 = \$92\). She used this money to buy 2 sets of measuring spoons for $6.5 each, which is a total of \(2 \times 6.5 = \$13\). The money she has left is \(92 - 13 = \$79\).

Hannah's total earnings from cookies and cupcakes are calculated as follows:

- Cookies: 40 pieces sold * $0.8 per piece = $32
- Cupcakes: 30 cupcakes sold * $2 per cupcake = $60
- Total earnings: $32 + $60 = $92

The cost of 2 sets of measuring spoons is:

- Cost per set: $6.5
- Total cost for 2 sets: 2 * $6.5 = $13

After buying the measuring spoons, the money left is:

- Money left: $92 - $13 = $79
