In the first half of the year, Santana buys birthday presents for her brothers. Since 3 are born in March, the first half includes 3 birthday presents. In the second half of the year, she buys Christmas presents for her brothers. Since there are 2 brothers born in December, in the second half she buys 2 Christmas presents. Therefore, she has to buy 3 + 2 = 5 more presents in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.

In the first half of the year, Santana buys a birthday present and a Christmas present for each of her 7 brothers. This means she buys 7 birthday presents and 7 Christmas presents, totaling 14 presents in the first half of the year.

In the second half of the year, she buys 1 Christmas present for her birthday in October, 1 for November, 1 for December, and 2 for January. This means she buys 4 additional Christmas presents in the second half of the year, in addition to the 14 presents bought in the first half.

So in the second half of the year, she buys a total of 14 + 4 = 18 presents.

To find out how many more presents she has to buy in the second half of the year than the first half, we subtract the number of presents bought in the first half from the number of presents bought in the second half:

18 - 14 = 4

Therefore, Santana has to buy 4 more presents in the second half of the year than in the first half.

First, we calculate the number of presents Santana buys in the first half of the year, which is March and October:
- March: 3 birthdays (each gets a birthday present)
- October: 1 birthday (this also gets a birthday present)
Total for first half of the year = 3 (March) + 1 (October) = 4 presents

Next, we calculate the number of presents Santana buys in the second half of the year, which is November and December:
- November: 2 birthdays (each gets a birthday present)
- December: 2 birthdays (this also gets a birthday present)
Total for second half of the year = 2 (November) + 2 (December) = 4 presents

Now, we subtract the total number of presents bought in the first half of the year from the total number bought in the second half of the year:
4 (first half) - 4 (second half) = 0

Therefore, Santana has 0 more presents to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.

To determine how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year compared to the first half, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Half of the Year (January to June):**
   - **January** (31 days): 3 of Santana's brothers have birthdays.
   - **February** (28/28 days): No birthday of any of her brothers in February.
   - **March** (31 days): 3 more birthdays.
   - **April** (30 days): 1 birthday.
   - **May** (31 days): 2 birthdays.
   - **June** (30 days): No birthday of any of her brothers in June.

   Total birthday presents first half of the year:
   \[
   3 (January) + 0 (February) + 3 (March) + 1 (April) + 2 (May) + 0 (June) = 9
   \]

2. **Second Half of the Year (July to December):**
   - **July** (31 days): No birthday of any of her brothers.
   - **August** (31 days): No birthday of any of her brothers.
   - **September** (30 days): No birthday of any of her brothers.
   - **October** (31 days): 1 more birthday.
   - **November** (30 days): 1 more birthday.
   - **December** (31 days): 2 more birthdays.

   Total birthday presents second half of the year:
   \[
   0 (July) + 0 (August) + 0 (September) + 1 (October) + 1 (November) + 2 (December) = 4
   \]

3. **Total presents Santana has to buy:**
   - Birthday presents in the first half: 9
   - Birthday presents in the second half: 4
   - Christmas presents for all 7 brothers:
   \[
   7 \text{ brothers} \times 1 \text{ present each} = 7
   \]
   - Total presents:
   \[
   9 + 4 + 7 = 20
   \]

4. **Comparison:**
   - Presents in the first half: 9
   - Presents in the second half: 4
   - Difference: 
   \[
   4 - 9 = -5
   \]

Thus, Santana has to buy 5 fewer presents in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.

In the first half of the year, Santana buys presents for 7 brothers. This means she buys 7 presents. Since Santana always buys presents for Christmas, she also buys one more present for Christmas. So, she buys a total of 8 presents in the first half of the year.

In the second half of the year, Santana buys presents for 1 brother in October, 1 brother in November, and 2 brothers in December. This means she buys 4 presents in the second half of the year.

Therefore, the difference in the number of presents she buys between the second half and the first half of the year is \(4 - 8 = -4\). This means she has to buy 4 more presents in the first half of the year than in the second half.

To find out how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year compared to the first half, we need to consider the number of presents for each half of the year.

In the first half of the year, Santana has to buy Christmas presents for each of her 7 brothers, which is 7 presents. This is the only gift she buys in the first half of the year since she only buys presents for her brothers.

In the second half of the year, Santana has to buy birthday presents for her brothers. She gives birthday presents to 3 brothers in March and 2 brothers in December. Additionally, she buys Christmas presents for each of the 7 brothers, which is 7 more presents.

So, for the second half of the year, Santana has to buy:
- 2 Christmas presents (in December)
- 3 birthday presents (in March)
- 1 birthday present (in October)
- 1 birthday present (in November)
- 7 Christmas presents (for the remaining 4 brothers)

This totals to:
\[ 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 14 \] presents.

For the first half of the year, she has to buy:
\[ 7 \] Christmas presents.

Therefore, the number of presents to buy in the second half of the year compared to the first half is:
\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \]

So, Santana has to buy 7 more presents in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.

To determine how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, let's break down the information:

- The first half of the year includes the months of January, February, and March (6 months).
- The second half of the year includes the months of April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, and January (11 months).

We know the following:
- 3 of her brothers have birthdays in March (first half of the year).
- 1 of her brothers has a birthday in October (second half of the year).
- 1 of her brothers has a birthday in November (second half of the year).
- 2 of her brothers were born in December (second half of the year).

The total number of presents Santana needs is the sum of the presents for the brothers' birthdays and Christmas gifts. Since she buys each brother a birthday present and a Christmas present, the total number of presents for each brother is 2. Therefore, for each of the birthday presents, she needs an additional Christmas present.

The number of birthday presents (6) is distributed across the first half of the year, and the number of Christmas presents (6) is distributed across the second half of the year.

To find how many more presents she needs in the second half of the year compared to the first half, we need to consider the distribution:
- Of the 6 birthday presents, 3 are in the first half and 3 are in the second half.
- Of the 6 Christmas presents, 0 are in the first half and 6 are in the second half.

The additional presents in the second half:
- Birthday presents: 3 (needed) - 3 (already bought in first half) = 0
- Christmas presents: 6 (needed) - 0 (already bought in first half) = 6

So, Santana has to buy 6 more presents in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.

To determine how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year than the first half, we first need to calculate the total number of presents she needs to buy in the first half (1st to 6 months) and the second half (7th to 12 months).

- **First half of the year (1st to 6 months):**
  - March: 3 brothers with birthdays
  - October: 1 brother with a birthday
  - November: 1 brother with a birthday
  - December: 2 brothers with birthdays
  Total presents for the first half: \( 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7 \)

  - March: 3 brothers with birthdays
  - October: 1 brother with a birthday
  - November: 1 brother with a birthday
  - December: 2 brothers with birthdays
  Total presents for the second half: \( 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7 \)

Since the total number of presents in the first half of the year and the second half of the year are the same (7 each), the difference in the number of presents bought in the first half and the second half is 0.

   - Birthday presents: 5 brothers (3 in March, 1 in October, 1 in November, and 2 in December)
   - Total presents: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) (since each brother gets one birthday present)

2. **Second Half of the Year (July - December):**
   - Christmas presents: Each of the 7 brothers gets a Christmas present, so \(7 \times 1 = 7\) presents

3. **Total presents from January to December:**
   - Total presents from first half: 10
   - Total presents from second half: 7
   - Total presents: \(10 + 7 = 17\)

4. **Difference between second half and first half:**
   - Presents in the second half: 7

To determine how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year than in the first half, we need to calculate the total number of presents she buys each period.

First, let's break down the presents she buys in the first half of the year:
- She buys a birthday present for each of her brothers, and each brother has a different birthday. Therefore, she buys 7 birthday presents in the first half of the year (one for each brother).

Next, we consider the presents she buys in the second half of the year:
- She buys a Christmas present for each of her brothers. There are 7 brothers, so she buys 7 Christmas presents in the second half of the year.

Now, we can calculate the total number of presents Santana buys:
- First half of the year: 7 birthday presents
- Second half of the year: 7 Christmas presents

Adding these together, the total number of presents she buys in a year is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \]

To find out how many more presents she has to buy in the second half of the year compared to the first half, we subtract the number of presents in the first half from the number in the second half:
\[ 7 - 7 = 0 \]

Therefore, Santana has to buy the same number of presents in the second half of the year as in the first half of the year.

To determine how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, we need to calculate the presents from each time period.

First, let's break down the presents from the first half of the year:
- 13 April: This presents are distributed between March and April (1 March, 1 April).
- 1 January: This presents are distributed between December and January (1 December, 1 January).

Now, let's calculate the presents from the first half:
1. March: March has 13 days (which includes birthdays and holidays), but since we are only counting the birthday presents, we have 12 more presents here, but since we are only discussing birthdays, we have 1 more birthday present.
2. April: April has 30 days, so we have 29 more birthdays to add.

Next, let's count presents from the second half of the year:
- 1st November: This presents are distributed between October and November (1 October, 1 November).
- 1st December: This presents are distributed between November and December (1 November, 1 December).

Now, let's calculate the presents from the second half:
1. October: October has 31 days, so we have 30 more birthdays to add.
2. November: November has 30 days, so we have 29 more birthdays to add.
3. December: December has 31 days, so we have 30 more birthdays to add.

Now, we add all the presents together:
- First half:
  - 23 presents (1 March + 1 April + 1 January + 13 April) + 29 more birthday presents in April.
- Second half:
  - 59 more birthday presents (30 in October + 29 in November + 30 in December).

Now, let's calculate differences:
- First half presents: 12 + 29 = 41
- Second half presents: 23 + 59 = 82
- Difference: 82 - 41 = 41

Therefore, Santana has to buy 41 more presents in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.

To determine how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year than the first half, we need to calculate the total number of presents in each half and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of presents Santana buys in the first half of the year. This includes presents for March birthdays and Christmas presents:
- Santana has 3 brothers with birthdays in March, so she buys 3 presents for the first half of the year.
- Santana also buys 1 present for the Christmas season.
Therefore, the total number of presents in the first half of the year is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of presents Santana buys in the second half of the year. This includes presents for October, November, and December birthdays:
- Santana has 2 brothers with birthdays in December, so she buys 2 presents for December, plus 1 present for the Christmas season.
Therefore, the total number of presents in the second half of the year is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Now, we find the difference between the total number of presents in the second half of the year and the first half of the year:
\[ 4 - 3 = 1 \]
