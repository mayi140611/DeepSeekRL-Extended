First, we need to find out the total cost of the meal after applying the coupon. The total price of the meal is $67, and they have a coupon for $4, so we subtract the $4 coupon from the total price:
\[ 67 - 4 = 63 \]
Now, they need to split the total cost evenly among the three people. So, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 63 \div 3 = 21 \]
Each person needs to contribute $21 to the bill.

$63 / 3 = $21

Therefore, each person needs to contribute $21 to the bill.

To determine how much each person needs to contribute, we first need to calculate the total cost of the meal after applying the coupon.

1. The original total price of the meal is $67. 
2. They have a coupon for $4, so we subtract the coupon from the original price:
   \[
   67 - 4 = 63
   \]

3. Now, the total cost of the meal is $63.

4. Since Sarah, Mary, and Tuan are splitting the cost evenly, we divide the total cost by the number of people:
   \[
   \frac{63}{3} = 21
   \]

Therefore, each person needs to contribute $21 to cover the cost of the meal.

First, we need to calculate the total amount after applying the coupon. The sum of the meal price and the discount is $67 + $4 = $71. 

Next, we need to divide this total by the number of people, which is 3. This is because the total cost of the meal should be split evenly among the three individuals. So, each person must contribute $71 / 3 = $23.67.

Therefore, each person needs to contribute $23.67 to the bill.

To determine how much each person needs to contribute, we first start with the total price of the meal before the coupon: $67.

Next, we apply the coupon to the total price. The coupon value is $4, so we subtract this amount from the total price:
\[ 67 - 4 = 63 \]

Now, Sarah, Mary, and Tuan need to split the remaining $63 evenly. We divide the remaining amount by the number of people:
\[ 63 \div 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, each person needs to contribute $21.
