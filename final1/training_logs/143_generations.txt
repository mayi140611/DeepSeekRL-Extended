###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Toby is counting goldfish in the local pond. He knows that only 25% of goldfish are at the surface and the rest are too deep below the surface to be able to see. If he counts 15 goldfish, how many are below the surface?

system
Let's denote the total number of goldfish in the pond by \( G \).

Given that Toby knows that only 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, he counts 15 goldfish. This means that 75% of the total number of goldfish are below the surface because:

\[ 0.25G = 15 \]

To find the total number of goldfish \( G \), we solve for \( G \):

\[ G = \frac{15}{0.25} = 60 \]

So, there are 60 goldfish in total in the pond.

Now, Toby knows that the remaining 75% are below the surface. To find out how many goldfish are below the surface, we calculate 75% of 60:

\[ \text{Number of goldfish below the surface} = 0.75 \times 60 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of goldfish below the surface is 45.

If Toby counts 15 goldfish and only 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, then we can find the total number of goldfish in the pond by setting up the equation \( 0.25x = 15 \), where \( x \) is the total number of goldfish. Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{15}{0.25} = 60
\]

So, there are 60 goldfish in total. If 25% of them are at the surface, then the remaining \( 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \) or 75% are below the surface. To find the number of goldfish below the surface, we calculate \( 0.75 \times 60 \).

If Toby counts 15 goldfish and he knows that 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, then 75% of the goldfish are below the surface.

To find out how many goldfish are below the surface, we can calculate 75% of 15:

\( \frac{75}{100} \times 15 = \frac{3}{4} \times 15 = 11.25 \)

Since we can't have a fraction of a goldfish, we'll round down to 11 goldfish.

So, there are 11 goldfish below the surface.

Let's break down the information given:
- Toby counts 15 goldfish at the surface.
- 25% of the goldfish are at the surface.
- Therefore, 75% of the goldfish are too deep below the surface.

To find the total number of goldfish, we know that 15 goldfish is 25% of the total number of goldfish.
Let's calculate the total number of goldfish:
\[
\text{Total number of goldfish} = \frac{15}{0.25} = 60
\]

Now, to find how many goldfish are below the surface, we calculate 75% of the total number of goldfish:
\[
\text{Goldfish below the surface} = 60 \times 0.75 = 45
\]

So, there are 45 goldfish below the surface.

Toby counts 15 goldfish while only 25% of the goldfish are at the surface. Let's calculate the total number of goldfish initially there.

If 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, that means 75% are below the surface. Toby counted 15 goldfish, which represent the 75% below the surface.

First, let's calculate the total number of goldfish:
\[ 15 \text{ goldfish} = 75\% \]
\[ \text{Total number of goldfish} = \frac{15}{0.75} = 20 \text{ goldfish} \]

Now, if 15 goldfish represent 75% of the total goldfish, and the rest (25%) are below the surface, we can find the number below the surface:

\[ 20 \text{ goldfish} - 15 \text{ goldfish} = 5 \text{ goldfish} \]

So, the number of goldfish below the surface is 5.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Toby counts 15 goldfish at the surface.
2. We know that only 25% of the goldfish are at the surface. This means that 75% of the goldfish (100% - 25%) are below the surface.
3. To find out how many goldfish are below the surface, we need to calculate 75% of the total goldfish population.
4. If the number of goldfish Toby counts is 15, this represents 100% of the goldfish. So, 15 goldfish represents 75% of the total goldfish.
5. To find the total number of goldfish, we set up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{75}{100} = \frac{15}{x}
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   75x = 100 \times 15
   \]
   \[
   75x = 1500
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1500}{75}
   \]
   \[
   x = 20
   \]
So, there are 20 goldfish in total.

6. Now, to find out how many goldfish are below the surface, we subtract the number of goldfish at the surface from the total number of goldfish:
   \[
   20 - 15 = 5
   \]
Therefore, there are 5 goldfish below the surface.

To find out how many goldfish are below the surface, we can first determine the total number of goldfish in the pond. Since 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, it means that the remaining 75% are below the surface. If Toby counts 15 goldfish at the surface, we can use the following equation to find the total number of goldfish:

\[ \text{Total goldfish} = \frac{\text{Number of goldfish at the surface}}{\text{Percentage of goldfish at the surface}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Total goldfish} = \frac{15}{0.25} = 60 \]

Now that we know there are 60 goldfish in total, we can calculate how many are below the surface:

\[ \text{Goldfish below the surface} = \text{Total goldfish} - \text{Number of goldfish at the surface} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Goldfish below the surface} = 60 - 15 = 45 \]

So, there are 45 goldfish below the surface.

Toby counts 15 goldfish out of a total that is 100%. There are two types of goldfish: those on the surface and those below the surface. Since only 25% of the goldfish are above the surface, the remaining 75% must be below the surface. To find the number of goldfish below the surface, calculate 75% of 15.

</reasoning>
<answer>
15 * 0.75 = 11.25

The number of goldfish below the surface is 11.25, which we can round to 11, but since fish are not split into parts, we need to consider the integer part which is 11 goldfish.

Let's reason through this problem step by step.

1. We know that only 25% of the goldfish are at the surface. This means that the remaining 75% must be below the surface.
2. Toby counted 15 goldfish at the surface. Let's calculate the total number of goldfish in the pond.
   - Since 25% represents 15 goldfish, we can set up a proportion: 25% / 100% = 15 goldfish / Total goldfish
   - From this proportion, we can solve for the total number of goldfish: Total goldfish = 15 goldfish * 4 = 60 goldfish.
3. Now that we know there are 60 goldfish in total, we can find out how many are below the surface.
   - Since 75% of the goldfish are below the surface, we can use the same proportion again to find the number of goldfish below the surface: Total goldfish * 75% = 60 goldfish * 0.75 = 45 goldfish.

There are 45 goldfish below the surface.

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Toby counts 15 goldfish on the surface.
2. We are given that 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, which means 75% are below the surface.
3. We need to calculate 75% of the total number of goldfish.

To calculate:
\[ \text{Goldfish below the surface} = 15 \times \frac{75}{100} \]

Now let's calculate:
\[ 15 \times 0.75 = 11.25 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a goldfish, we should round it to the nearest whole number. In this case, 11.25 rounds to 11.

Let's denote the total number of goldfish in the pond as \( T \). According to the problem, 25% of the goldfish are at the surface. Therefore, the number of goldfish at the surface is \( 0.25T \). The remaining 75% are below the surface, so the number of goldfish below the surface is \( 0.75T \).

We are given that Toby counts 15 goldfish at the surface. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.25T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.25} = 60 \]

Now that we know the total number of goldfish in the pond is 60, we can find the number of goldfish below the surface:

\[ 0.75T = 0.75 \times 60 = 45 \]

So, there are 45 goldfish below the surface.

The number of goldfish that are below the surface is 75%. If 25% of the goldfish are at the surface and Toby counts 15 goldfish at the surface, then 15 = 25% of the total number of goldfish. This means the total number of goldfish is 15 / 25 = 0.6 times 100 = 60. If 25% are at the surface, then 75% are below the surface. 75% of 60 is 0.75 * 60 = 45.

Toby counted 15 goldfish, which represent 25% of the total number of goldfish in the pond. To find the total number of goldfish, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Total number of goldfish} = \frac{\text{Number of goldfish observed}}{\text{Percentage of goldfish visible}} \]

\[ \text{Total number of goldfish} = \frac{15}{0.25} = 60 \]

So, the total number of goldfish is 60.

To find out how many goldfish are below the surface, we subtract the number of goldfish seen on the surface (15) from the total number of goldfish:

\[ \text{Goldfish below the surface} = \text{Total number of goldfish} - \text{Goldfish on the surface} \]

\[ \text{Goldfish below the surface} = 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Therefore, there are 45 goldfish below the surface.
