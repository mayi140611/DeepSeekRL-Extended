<reasoning>
First, calculate the total volume of air needed to fill all the balloons. Since each balloon holds 10 liters of air and John buys 1000 balloons, the total volume of air needed is:

\[ 1000 \text{ balloons} \times 10 \text{ liters/balloon} = 10000 \text{ liters} \]

Next, since each tank holds 500 liters, the number of tanks needed is the total volume of air divided by the capacity of one tank:

\[ \frac{10000 \text{ liters}}{500 \text{ liters/tank}} = 20 \text{ tanks} \]

Therefore, John needs to buy 20 tanks to fill all the balloons.

Each balloon holds 10 liters of air, and John has 1000 balloons, so the total volume of air needed is \(1000 \text{ balloons} \times 10 \text{ liters/balloon} = 10000 \text{ liters}\).

Since each tank of gas holds 500 liters, the number of tanks needed is \(10000 \text{ liters} / 500 \text{ liters/tank} = 20 \text{ tanks}\).

Therefore, John needs to buy 20 tanks of gas to fill all the balloons.

To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total volume of air required to fill all the balloons. 

Each balloon holds 10 liters of air, and John has 1000 balloons. Therefore, the total volume of air required is:
\[ 10 \text{ liters/balloon} \times 1000 \text{ balloons} = 10000 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 500-liter tanks of gas are required to provide 10000 liters of air. This is calculated by dividing the total volume of air needed by the volume of each tank:
\[ \frac{10000 \text{ liters}}{500 \text{ liters/tank}} = 20 \text{ tanks} \]

Therefore, John needs to buy 20 tanks of gas to fill all the balloons.

To determine how many 500-liter tanks of gas John needs, we first calculate the total volume of air required to fill all the balloons. Each balloon holds 10 liters of air, and John has 1000 balloons.

Total volume of air needed = 10 liters/balloon * 1000 balloons = 10,000 liters.

Next, we need to find out how many 500-liter tanks are required to provide 10,000 liters of gas.

Number of tanks = Total volume of air needed / Volume per tank = 10,000 liters / 500 liters/tank = 20 tanks.

Thus, John needs 20 tanks to fill all the balloons.

John has 1000 balloons, and each balloon holds 10 liters of air. Hence, the total amount of gas required to fill all the balloons is:

\[ 1000 \text{ balloons} \times 10 \text{ liters/balloon} = 10,000 \text{ liters} \]

He buys 500-liter tanks of gas. To find out how many tanks he needs:

\[ \frac{10000 \text{ liters}}{500 \text{ liters/tank}} = 20 \text{ tanks} \]

Therefore, John needs to buy 20 tanks of gas to fill all the balloons.

John has 1000 balloons, and each balloon holds 10 liters of air. Therefore, he needs a total of \(1000 \times 10 = 10000\) liters of air to fill all the balloons. If each tank of gas contains 500 liters, the number of tanks needed can be calculated by dividing the total liters required (10000) by the capacity of one tank (500).

So, \( \frac{10000}{500} = 20 \). Therefore, John needs to buy 20 tanks of gas to fill all the balloons.

To find out how many 500-liter tanks of gas John needs to buy, we first need to determine the total amount of air required to fill all the balloons. Since each balloon holds 10 liters of air and John has 1000 balloons, the total amount of air needed is:
\[ Total\ Air\ Required = Number\ of\ Balloons \times Air\ per\ Balloon = 1000 \times 10 = 10000 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 500-liter tanks are required to provide this amount of air. To find this, we divide the total required air by the size of one tank:
\[ Tanks\ Required = \frac{Total\ Air\ Required}{Tank\ Size} = \frac{10000}{500} = 20 \]

However, since John cannot buy a fraction of a tank, he needs to round up to ensure he has enough air. Therefore, he needs to buy 20 tanks to have enough gas to fill all of the balloons.

To determine how many 500-liter tanks of gas John needs to buy to fill all 1000 balloons, we first need to calculate the total volume of gas required to fill all the balloons.

Each balloon holds 10 liters of air, so for 1000 balloons, the total volume of air needed is:
\[ 1000 \text{ balloons} \times 10 \text{ liters/balloon} = 10000 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to convert the total volume of air from liters to 500-liter tanks. We do this by dividing the total volume by the capacity of one tank:
\[ \frac{10000 \text{ liters}}{500 \text{ liters/tank}} = 20 \text{ tanks} \]

Since John cannot buy a fraction of a tank, he will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 20 tanks of gas to ensure he has enough to fill all the balloons, even though he will have a little over 10000 liters but will still need one tank to get the remaining liters.

\[ 1000 \text{ balloons} \times 10 \text{ liters/balloon} = 10000 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 500-liter tanks are required to cover the total volume of air needed. We do this by dividing the total volume of air by the volume of each tank:
\[ \frac{10000 \text{ liters}}{500 \text{ liters/tank}} = 20 \text{ tanks} \]
