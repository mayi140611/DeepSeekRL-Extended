To find the daily average rain total for the week, we first need to calculate the total amount of rain for the week.

1. **Monday:**
   - Rainfall: \(2 + 1 = 3\) inches

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Rainfall: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Rainfall: \(0\) inches

4. **Thursday:**
   - Rainfall: \(1\) inch

5. **Friday:**
   - Rainfall: \(3 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 8\) inches

Now, sum the total rainfall for the week:
\[
2 \text{ (Monday morning)} + 1 \text{ (Monday evening)} + 3 \text{ (Monday total)} + 4 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1 \text{ (Thursday)} + 8 \text{ (Friday)} = 21 \text{ inches}
\]

There are 7 days in a week, so the daily average rainfall is:
\[
\frac{21 \text{ inches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 3 \text{ inches per day}
\]

To find the daily average rain total for the week, we first need to determine the total rainfall for each day and then divide by the number of days.

1. Monday: Rainfall on Monday morning was 2 inches, and 1 more inch later in the day. Therefore, the total rain on Monday was:
   \[
   2 + 1 = 3 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Tuesday: The rain was twice that much as on Monday. Therefore, the total rain on Tuesday was:
   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Wednesday: It did not rain on Wednesday. Therefore, the total rain on Wednesday was:
   \[
   0 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. Thursday: It rained 1 inch on Thursday. Therefore, the total rain on Thursday was:
   \[
   1 \text{ inch}
   \]

5. Friday: The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. The total rain from Monday to Thursday is:
   \[
   3 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1 \text{ (Thursday)} = 10 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, the total rain on Friday was 10 inches.

Now, we sum up the total rain for the week:
\[
3 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1 \text{ (Thursday)} + 10 \text{ (Friday)} = 20 \text{ inches}
\]

The daily average rain total for the week is:
\[
\frac{20 \text{ inches}}{5 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ inches per day}
\]

To find the total rain for the week, we start by calculating the rain for each day:

1. Monday morning: 2 inches
2. Monday afternoon: 2 + 1 = 3 inches
3. Tuesday: 2 * 2 = 4 inches
4. Wednesday: 0 inches
5. Thursday: 1 inch
6. Friday: Total of Monday through Thursday = 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 10 inches

Next, we sum up all the rain for the week: 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 20 inches.

To find the daily average rainfall, we divide the total rain for the week by the number of days (7 days): 20 ÷ 7 ≈ 2.86 inches.

First, we calculate the total rainfall for each day:
- Monday: 2 inches in the morning and 1 inch later that day, so 2 + 1 = 3 inches.
- Tuesday: Twice as much as Monday, so 2 * 3 = 6 inches.
- Wednesday: No rain, so 0 inches.
- Thursday: 1 inch of rain.
- Friday: The total was equal to the combined total of Monday through Thursday, so 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 = 10 inches.

Now, we calculate the total rainfall for the week:
3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 0 (Wednesday) + 1 (Thursday) + 10 (Friday) = 20 inches.

To find the daily average rain total for the week, we divide the total weekly rainfall by the number of days in the week:
20 inches / 5 days = 4 inches per day.

To find the daily average rain total for the week, we first need to calculate the total rain for each day and then find the average.

1. **Monday**: It rained 2 inches in the morning and 1 more inch later that day, so the total for Monday is 2 + 1 = 3 inches.
2. **Tuesday**: It rained twice as much as Monday, so the total for Tuesday is 2 * 3 = 6 inches.
3. **Wednesday**: It did not rain on Wednesday, so the total is 0 inches.
4. **Thursday**: It rained 1 inch on Thursday.
5. **Friday**: The total rain on Friday is equal to the total rain from Monday to Thursday, so the total for Friday is 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 = 10 inches.

To find the daily average rain total, we need to first calculate the total amount of rain for the week by summing up the rainfalls on each day. Let's break it down:

1. Monday: 2 inches in the morning and 1 inch later that day, so total = 2 + 1 = 3 inches.
2. Tuesday: Twice the amount as Monday, so total = 2 * 3 = 6 inches.
3. Wednesday: No rain, total = 0 inches.
4. Thursday: 1 inch, so total = 0 + 1 = 1 inch.
5. Friday: The storm on Friday was equal to the total of Monday through Thursday combined, which was 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 = 10 inches.

The total for the week is 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 20 inches.

To find the daily average, we divide the total weekly rain by the number of days in a week (7). Therefore, the daily average is 20 inches / 7 days = 2.86 inches per day. Rounded to two decimal places, this becomes approximately 2.86 inches per day.

On Monday morning it rained 2 inches. Later that day, it rained 1 more inch. So, it rained a total of 2 + 1 = 3 inches on Monday. On Tuesday it rained twice that amount, so 3 * 2 = 6 inches on Tuesday. On Wednesday, it did not rain at all, and on Thursday, it rained 1 inch. The total rain from Monday to Thursday combined is 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 = 10 inches. The largest storm was on Friday, which was equal to Monday through Thursday combined, so it rained 10 inches. Therefore, the daily average rain total for the week is (3 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 10) / 5 = 6 inches.

To determine the daily average rain total for the week, we need to calculate the total rainfall for each day and then find the average based on the daily totals.

First, let's summarize the rainfall for each day:
- Monday: 2 inches morning, 1 inch later that day. Total for Monday: 2 + 1 = 3 inches.
- Tuesday: Twice the amount of Monday. Total for Tuesday: 2 * 3 = 6 inches.
- Wednesday: 0 inches.
- Thursday: 1 inch.
- Friday: The total for Friday is equal to the combined total for Monday through Thursday. 

Total for Monday through Thursday: 3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 0 (Wednesday) + 1 (Thursday) = 10 inches.
Since the biggest storm on Friday is equal to the combined total for Monday through Thursday, Friday's total is also 10 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total rainfall for the whole week:
\[ \text{Total for the week} = 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 20 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we find the daily average rain total. There are 5 days in a week's worth of data (Monday through Friday), so we divide the total rainfall by 5:
\[ \text{Daily average} = \frac{20 \text{ inches}}{5} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the daily average rain total for the week is **4 inches**.
