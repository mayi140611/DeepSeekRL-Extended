###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Bobby needed to make some trips with his truck and had only 12 gallons of gasoline. He drives to a supermarket 5 miles away and then drives back home. Then he headed to his farm which was 6 miles away. Two miles into the journey, he turned around and drove back home to retrieve some farming tools he forgot to take earlier and drove down to the farm. If he now has exactly 2 gallons of gasoline left, at what rate in miles per gallon has his truck been consuming gasoline?

First, we need to calculate the total distance that Bobby has driven. He drove to the supermarket, back home, then drove to his farm, back home, and then drove to the farm. Let's add up all these distances:

- To the supermarket: 5 miles
- Back home: 5 miles
- To the farm: 6 miles
- Back home to get farming tools: 2 miles
- To the farm again: 6 miles

Total distance driven = 5 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 24 miles

Bobby started with 12 gallons of gasoline and ended up with 2 gallons left, so he used:

12 gallons - 2 gallons = 10 gallons of gasoline

Now, to find the rate of gasoline consumption per mile, we divide the total distance driven by the total gallons of gasoline used:

Rate = Total Distance / Total Gallons Used
     = 24 miles / 10 gallons
     = 2.4 miles per gallon

Therefore, Bobby's truck has been consuming gasoline at a rate of 2.4 miles per gallon.

To find the rate at which Bobby's truck has been consuming gasoline, we need to calculate the total distance he has driven and the total amount of gasoline he consumed.

First, we'll calculate the total distance driven. The truck drove to the supermarket 5 miles away, then back home 5 miles, to the farm 6 miles away, then back home 2 miles, and then to the farm again 4 miles. So the total distance is:

\[ 5 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 4 = 22 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we'll calculate the total amount of gasoline consumed. Bobby started with 12 gallons and has 2 gallons left, so he used:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ gallons} \]

Now we can find the rate of gas consumption in miles per gallon:

\[ \frac{22 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ gallons}} = 2.2 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

So, the truck has been consuming gasoline at a rate of 2.2 miles per gallon.

Let's break down the total distance and the gasoline consumption for each leg of Bobby's journey:

1. **Truck to the supermarket**: 5 miles out and 5 miles back, total 10 miles.
2. **Truck to the farm**: 6 miles out and 2 miles back, total 4 miles.
3. **Truck to retrieve tools**: 2 miles to go back to home and 8 miles to the farm, totaling 10 miles.
4. **Truck back home**: 12 miles total from home to the farm minus the 2 miles left, totaling 10 miles back home.

So, the total distance traveled is:
\[10 \text{ miles} (\text{to the supermarket}) + 4 \text{ miles} (\text{to the farm}) + 10 \text{ miles} (\text{to retrieve tools}) + 10 \text{ miles} (\text{back home}) = 34 \text{ miles}\]

Bobby started with 12 gallons of gasoline and has 2 gallons left, so he used \(12 - 2 = 10\) gallons.

To find the rate of consumption in miles per gallon, we divide the total distance by the total gasoline used:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Gasoline Used}} = \frac{34 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ gallons}} = 3.4 \text{ miles per gallon}\]

To calculate Bobby's consumption rate in miles per gallon, we need to determine the total distance he traveled and his total gasoline consumption.

1. **Distance traveled:**
   - To the supermarket: 5 miles
   - Back home: 5 miles
   - To the farm: 6 miles
   - Two miles back home (turning around): 2 miles
   - Down to the farm: 6 miles
   - Total distance = 5 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 24 miles

2. **Total gasoline consumption:**
   Bobby started with 12 gallons and ends with 2 gallons, so he used 12 - 2 = 10 gallons of gasoline.

3. **Average speed calculation:**
   Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time taken.

   Since the problem doesn't specify the time taken for each part of the journey, we'll assume that the time taken for each segment is proportional to the distance traveled in order to calculate the average speed. However, for the rate of gasoline consumption, we can directly divide the total gallons used by the total distance traveled.

4. **Rate of gasoline consumption:**
   Rate of gasoline consumption = Total gallons used / Total distance traveled
   Rate of gasoline consumption = 10 gallons / 24 miles = 0.4167 miles per gallon (rounded to 4 decimal places).

So, the rate at which his truck has been consuming gasoline is approximately 0.4167 miles per gallon.

The total distance Bobby covered can be calculated as the distance to the supermarket back home (5 miles each way) plus the distance to the farm (6 miles), minus the two miles he turned around, which is 15 miles. Adding the distance back to the farm (2 miles) gives a total distance of 20 miles.

The gasoline consumed is the total distance minus the 12 gallons available, so it is 20 - 12 = 8 gallons.

The consumption rate in miles per gallon is the total distance covered divided by the amount of gasoline used: 20 / 8 = 2.5 miles per gallon.

To determine the rate of gasoline consumption in miles per gallon, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total amount of gasoline used.

Bobby's trips are as follows:
1. From his home to the supermarket and back: distance = 5 miles + 5 miles = 10 miles.
2. From the supermarket to the farm: distance = 6 miles.
3. From the farm back to the home: distance = 2 miles.
4. From the home to the farm again: distance = 10 miles + 6 miles = 16 miles.

The total distance traveled is the sum of all these trips:
\[ 10 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 34 \text{ miles} \]

Bobby started with 12 gallons of gasoline and has 2 gallons left. So, the total amount of gasoline used is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} - 2 \text{ gallons} = 10 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we can calculate the rate of gasoline consumption in miles per gallon by dividing the total distance by the total gasoline used:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{34 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ gallons}} = 3.4 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

So, the truck has been consuming gasoline at a rate of 3.4 miles per gallon.

To determine the rate at which Bobby's truck has been consuming gasoline, we can calculate the total distance driven and divide it by the total gallons of gasoline used.

1. **Distance to Supermarket and Back Home:**
   - Distance = 5 miles (to the supermarket) + 5 miles (back home) = 10 miles
   - Two miles of this journey were retraced, so the final distance driven in this leg is 8 miles.

2. **Distance to Farm and Back for Retrieval:**
   - Distance = 2 miles (to the farm) + 2 miles (to retrive tools) + 14 miles (from farm to home)
   - Total distance for this leg = 2 miles + 2 miles + 14 miles = 18 miles

3. **Total Distance Driven:**
   - Total = 10 miles (to Supermarket and back) + 18 miles (to Farm, back retrieval and back home)
   - Total = 28 miles

4. **Total Gasoline Used:**
   - Initially, Bobby had 12 gallons of gasoline.
   - He has exactly 2 gallons left.
   - Total gas used = 12 gallons (initial) - 2 gallons (left) = 10 gallons

5. **Rate of Consumption:**
   - The rate is given by the total distance driven divided by the total gas used.
   - Rate = Total Distance Driven / Total Gas Used
   - Rate = 28 miles / 10 gallons
   - Rate = 2.8 miles per gallon

Therefore, the rate at which Bobby's truck has been consuming gasoline is 2.8 miles per gallon.

1. **First Trip to the Supermarket and Back:**
   - Distance to the supermarket = 5 miles.
   - Distance back home = 5 miles.
   - Total distance for this trip = \(5 + 5 = 10\) miles.
   - He had 12 gallons of gasoline initially and now has 2 gallons left.
   - Gasoline consumed = \(12 - 2 = 10\) gallons.
   - Rate of consumption = \(\frac{10 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ gallons}} = 1 \text{ mile per gallon (mpg)}\).

2. **Second Trip to the Farm and Back with a Turnaround:**
   - Distance to the farm from home = 6 miles.
   - Distance back to the home before the turnaround = 2 miles.
   - Distance from the home to the farm after the turnaround = 6 - 2 = 4 miles.
   - Total distance for this trip = \(6 + 2 + 4 = 12\) miles.
   - He had 10 gallons of gasoline left after the first trip.
   - Gasoline consumed = Initial gasoline (12 gallons) - Consumed gasoline for the first trip (10 gallons) = 10 - 10 = 0 gallons (since he finished his trip).
   - Rate of consumption for this trip = \(\frac{0 \text{ miles}}{0 \text{ gallons}} = 0 \text{ mpg}\).

Combining the two trips:
- Total miles driven = 10 (first trip) + 12 (second trip) = 22 miles.
- Total gallons used = 12 (initial) - 2 (left after first trip) + 0 (consumed during second trip) = 10 gallons.
- Rate of consumption = \(\frac{22 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ gallons}} = 2.2 \text{ mpg}\).

To determine the rate at which Bobby's truck consumes gasoline, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and then divide the remaining gallons of gasoline by the total distance traveled.

First, calculate the total distance:
1. From his home to the supermarket: 5 miles
2. Back home: 5 miles
3. To the farm: 6 miles
4. To the point where he turned around 2 miles into the journey to the farm: X miles (where X is the distance from the farm to the turning point, unknown but subtracted later)
5. Back home to the turning point: (6 - 2) miles = 4 miles
6. To the farm: 6 miles

Total distance = 5 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 28 miles

Next, calculate the total gasoline used:
Initial gasoline = 12 gallons
Remaining gasoline = 2 gallons
Gasoline used = 12 - 2 = 10 gallons

Let's break down the trips and the fuel consumption:

1. **Supermarket Trip**: 
   - Distance: 5 miles to the supermarket + 5 miles back home = 10 miles.
   - Therefore, 10 miles of journey = 2 gallons of fuel consumed.

2. **Farm Trip**:
   - Distance to halfway point: 2 miles.
   - Remaining distance to farm: 6 miles - 2 miles = 4 miles.
   - This is a round trip from the half-way point to the farm and back, making it 8 miles in total.
   - Therefore, 8 miles of journey = 2 gallons of fuel consumed.

In total, the fuel consumption is for these trips:
\[ \text{Total fuel consumed} = 10 \, \text{miles} + 8 \, \text{miles} = 18 \, \text{miles} \]

The truck started with 12 gallons of gasoline, and it has 2 gallons left now, so it consumed:
\[ 12 \, \text{gallons} - 2 \, \text{gallons} = 10 \, \text{gallons} \]

To find the fuel consumption rate in miles per gallon, we use the following equation:
\[ \text{Fuel consumption rate} = \frac{\text{Total distance driven}}{\text{Total fuel consumed}} \]

\[ \text{Fuel consumption rate} = \frac{18 \, \text{miles}}{10 \, \text{gallons}} = 1.8 \, \text{miles per gallon} \]

Therefore, Bobby’s truck has been consuming gasoline at a rate of \( \boxed{1.8} \) miles per gallon.
