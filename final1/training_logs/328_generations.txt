#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles, we first need to find the number of motorcycles and cars separately. 

1. **Calculating the number of motorcycles:**
   - Since a third of the vehicles are motorcycles, and the total number of vehicles is 24, the number of motorcycles is:
   \[
   \text{Number of motorcycles} = \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
   \]

2. **Calculating the number of cars:**
   - The remaining vehicles are cars, so the number of cars is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cars} = 24 - 8 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculating the total number of tires on the motorcycles:**
   - Each motorcycle has 2 tires.
   \[
   \text{Total tires on motorcycles} = 8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

4. **Calculating the number of cars with spare tires:**
   - A quarter of the cars have a spare tire included, so the number of cars with spare tires is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cars with spare tires} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
   \]

5. **Calculating the total number of tires on the cars with spare tires:**
   - Each car with a spare tire has 3 tires (2 regular tires + 1 spare tire).
   \[
   \text{Total tires on cars with spare tires} = 4 \times (2 + 1) = 4 \times 3 = 12
   \]

6. **Calculating the total number of tires on the cars without spare tires:**
   - Each car without a spare tire has 2 regular tires.
   \[
   \text{Total tires on cars without spare tires} = 16 \times 2 = 32
   \]

7. **Calculating the total number of tires on all vehicles:**
   - The total number of tires is the sum of the tires on the motorcycles and the cars:
   \[
   \text{Total tires} = 16 + 32 = 48
   \]

Therefore, the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles in all is 48.

To find the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles, we need to determine the number of motorcycles and cars, and then calculate the tires accordingly.

1. **Calculate the number of motorcycles:**
   Since a third of the vehicles are motorcycles, we have:
   \[
   \text{Number of motorcycles} = \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cars:**
   The total number of vehicles is 24, and we already know the number of motorcycles is 8. So, the number of cars is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cars} = 24 - 8 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of tires on the motorcycles:**
   Each motorcycle has 2 tires, so the total number of tires on the motorcycles is:
   \[
   \text{Tires on motorcycles} = 8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of tires on the cars:**
   Each car has 4 tires, and a quarter of the cars have a spare tire included. Therefore, each of the 1/4 of 16 cars (4 cars) will have an additional tire. So, the total number of tires on these cars is:
   \[
   \text{Tires on 1/4 of the cars} = 4 \times 4 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20
   \]
   The other 3/4 of the cars (12 cars) will have only their standard 4 tires. So, the total number of tires on these cars is:
   \[
   \text{Tires on 3/4 of the cars} = 12 \times 4 = 48
   \]
   Adding these together, the total number of tires on the cars is:
   \[
   \text{Tires on cars} = 20 + 48 = 68
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of tires:**
   Finally, we add the tires from the motorcycles and the cars together:
   \[
   \text{Total tires} = 16 + 68 = 84
   \]

Therefore, the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles in all is **84**.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of vehicles**: 24 vehicles.
2. **Number of motorcycles**: 24 * (1/3) = 8 motorcycles.
3. **Number of cars**: 24 - 8 = 16 cars.
4. **Number of cars with spare tire**: 16 * (1/4) = 4 cars have a spare tire.
5. **Number of cars without spare tire**: 16 - 4 = 12 cars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of tires on the vehicles:

- **Motorcycles (all tires)**: 8 * 2 = 16 tires.
- **Cars with spare tire (all tires)**: 4 * 3 = 12 tires.
- **Cars without spare tire (front tires)**: 12 * 2 = 24 tires.

Adding these together, we get:
16 (motorcycle tires) + 12 (car with spare tire tires) + 24 (car without spare tire tires) = 52 tires.

Hence,

To determine the total number of tires, we need to calculate the number of motorcycles and cars, and then find out how many tires each type of vehicle has.

First, we know that the total number of vehicles (cars and motorcycles) is 24. A third of the vehicles are motorcycles:
\[
\text{Number of motorcycles} = \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
\]

Since the remaining vehicles are cars:
\[
\text{Number of cars} = 24 - 8 = 16
\]

Next, we need to find the number of tires on the motorcycles and cars. A motorcycle typically has 2 tires:
\[
\text{Total tires from motorcycles} = 8 \times 2 = 16
\]

For the cars, a quarter of the cars have a spare tire included. Therefore, a quarter of the cars will have 2 + 1 = 3 tires each:
\[
\text{Number of cars with spare tire} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
\]
\[
\text{Total tires from cars} = 4 \times (2 + 1) = 8
\]

Summing the tires from both motorcycles and cars:
\[
\text{Total tires} = 16 + 8 = 24
\]

Thus, the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]

Let's break it down:

1. There are 24 vehicles in total (cars + motorcycles).
2. A third of the vehicles are motorcycles, so 2/3 of 24 vehicles are motorcycles:
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \) motorcycles.
3. The remaining vehicles must be cars, so 24 - 16 = 8 cars.
4. A quarter of the cars have a spare tire, so 1/4 of 8 cars have a spare tire:
   \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) cars have a spare tire.
5. To find the total number of tires, we need to consider both the regular tires and the spare tires:
   a) Regular tires (on cars): 8 cars * 4 tires per car = 32 tires.
   b) Spare tires for cars: 2 cars * 1 spare tire per car = 2 tires.
   c) Spares (on motorcycles): All 16 motorcycles have spares, so 16 spares.
   d) Total tires (including spares): 32 regular tires + 2 spare tires + 16 spare tires = 40 spares.

Therefore, the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles in all is 40 spares.

To determine the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles, we start by identifying the number of cars and motorcycles.

First, we know that a third of the vehicles are motorcycles. Therefore, the number of motorcycles is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of motorcycles} = \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
\]

Next, the number of cars is the total number of vehicles minus the number of motorcycles:
\[
\text{Number of cars} = 24 - 8 = 16
\]

Now, we calculate the number of tires on the cars and motorcycles separately. Each car has 4 tires, and each motorcycle has 2 tires.

The number of tires on the cars is:
\[
\text{Number of tires on cars} = 16 \times 4 = 64
\]

The number of tires on the motorcycles is:
\[
\text{Number of tires on motorcycles} = 8 \times 2 = 16
\]

Adding the number of tires from cars and motorcycles gives us the total number of tires on all the vehicles:
\[
\text{Total number of tires} = 64 + 16 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles in all is:

A quarter of the cars do not have a spare tire included, so:

To find the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of motorcycles and cars:**
   - A third of the vehicles are motorcycles, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8 \) motorcycles.
   - Therefore, the number of cars is \( 24 - 8 = 16 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of tires on the motorcycles:**
   - Each motorcycle has two tires, so for 8 motorcycles, the total number of tires is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) tires.

3. **Calculate the number of tires on the cars:**
   - A quarter of the cars have a spare tire included. That means \( \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \) cars are included with a spare.
   - Therefore, the number of tires on the other cars is \( 16 - 4 = 12 \) tires.
   - Each of these cars has 4 tires, so the total number of tires for these cars is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) tires.

4. **Calculate the total number of tires:**
   - Adding the tires from the motorcycles and the other cars, we get \( 16 + 16 = 32 \) tires in total.

**Reasoning:**
- The total number of vehicles is 24, which is the sum of motorcycles and cars.
- A third of these vehicles are motorcycles, which gives us 8 motorcycles.
- The remaining 16 vehicles are cars.
- A quarter of the cars (4 cars) have a spare tire, so 12 cars do not have spare tires.
- Each of these 12 cars has 4 tires.
- Each motorcycle has 2 tires.
- Thus, the total number of tires is \( 16 \) from motorcycles and \( 16 \) from 12 cars.

There are 32 tires in all on the used car lot's vehicles.
