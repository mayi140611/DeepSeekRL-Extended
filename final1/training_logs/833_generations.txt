In this problem, we need to determine how many dogs Mariel is walking based on the total number of legs and the fact that some of those legs are tangled with another dog walker.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Number of Legs:**
   Each dog has 4 legs, and each human has 2 legs. Let \( M \) be the number of dogs Mariel is walking. The total number of legs can be calculated as follows:
   - Legs of Mariel: \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \)
   - Legs of the other dog walker: \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
   - Legs of the 3 dogs: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \)
   Thus, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   4 + 2 + 12 = 18
   \]

2. **Legs Tangled:**
   Mariel gets tangled with another dog walker and their 3 dogs, which means they are contributing to the total number of legs. The total number of legs tangled is 36. 

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   Let \( T \) be the number of dogs the other dog walker is walking. Since all these dogs are contributing to the 36 legs, we can set up the following equation considering the total number of legs:
   - Legs of Mariel’s dogs: \( 4k \) (where \( k \) is the number of dogs Mariel is walking)
   - Legs of the other dog walker’s dogs: \( 4(T + 1) \) (since the other walker is walking \( T + 1 \) dogs)

   The sum of all legs (tangled and non-tangled) is given by:
   \[
   4k + 2 + 12 + 4(T + 1) = 36
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   4k + 2 + 12 + 4T + 4 = 36
   \]
   \[
   4k + 4T + 18 = 36
   \]
   \[
   4k + 4T = 18
   \]
   \[
   k + T = 4.5
   \]

5. **Solving for \( k \):**
   Since \( k \) (the number of dogs Mariel is walking) and \( T \) (the number of dogs the other walker is walking) must be integers:
   \[
   k = 4, \quad T = 0
   \]
   This means Mariel is walking 4 dogs and the other dog walker is not walking any dogs.

6. **Conclusion:**
   Mariel is walking 4 dogs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. Mariel is walking dogs, and we don't know how many.
2. The other dog walker and their 3 dogs are walking, and we need to determine how many dogs Mariel is walking in addition to their 3 dogs.
3. We know that each dog has 4 legs, and each person has 2 legs.

Since Mariel is tangled up with the other dog walker and their 3 dogs, she is tangled with:
- 1 person (the other dog walker)
- 4 dogs (the other dog walker and their 3 dogs)

This means Mariel is:
- Tangled with the other dog walker
- Tangled with 4 dogs in total

In total, for Mariel, this counts as:
- 1 person (tangled with the other dog walker)
- 4 dogs (tangled with)

Adding these together for Mariel, we get:
- 1 person (tangled with the other dog walker)
- 4 dogs (tangled with)

However, the question asks for the total number of dogs Mariel is walking, not just the dogs tangled with her.

Since Mariel is walking 3 dogs with the other dog walker, and assuming she is walking a total of \( n \) dogs (including the dogs she is walking):
- 3 dogs with the other dog walker
- \( n - 3 \) dogs (Mariel's dogs not tangled with her)

In total, the number of dogs is:
\[ 3 \text{ (dogs with the other walker)} + n \text{ (Mariel's dogs)} \]

However, we know that the total number of legs is 36. To find out how many dogs Mariel is walking, let's establish how many dogs the other walker and their dogs are walking:
- The other walker and their 3 dogs are 4 people and 4 dogs in total. Each person has 2 legs, and each dog has 4 legs.
- So, they have:
  - 4 people * 2 legs/person = 8 legs
  - 4 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 16 legs
  Total: 8 + 16 = 24 legs

Mariel and her dogs (including the others) make up the rest of the legs:
- Let's say Mariel's dogs are \( x \)
- The total number of legs for Mariel and her dogs including the others is:
  8 (people) + 16 (dogs) + 36 legs (Mariel and her dogs) = 34 legs

So, Mariel's dogs make up:
- \( 34 \text{ legs} - 24 \text{ legs (excluding Mariel and her dogs)} = 10 \text{ legs} \)

This 10 legs must be from Mariel's dogs:
- 10 legs / 4 legs/dog = 2.5 dogs

Since the number of dogs must be a whole number, this calculation should be reconsidered.
We need Mariel to be walking at least 2 dogs herself to account for the extra legs. If she's walking 2 dogs:
- 2 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 8 legs for Mariel's dogs
- Adding this to the original 16 legs accounts for the total 36 legs.

So, Mariel is walking 5 dogs in total:
- 3 dogs with the other walker
- 2 of her own dogs

Therefore, Mariel is walking 5 dogs.

Let's denote the number of dogs Mariel is walking as \( x \).

Each dog has 4 legs, and each leash has 2 ends. If Mariel is walking \( x \) dogs, she would normally be contributing to \( 4x \) legs. However, since she got tangled in another dog's leash, we need to account for the additional 2 legs from one dog walker's leash.

Each of Mariel and the other dog walker has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs from the other dog walker is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) legs.

We know the total number of legs is 36. Adding the extra 4 legs from the other dog walker gives us:

\[ 4x + 4 = 36 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 4x = 32 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, Mariel is walking 8 dogs.

Let's denote the number of dogs Mariel is walking as \( x \). Each dog has 4 legs, and each leash connection involves 2 legs (one leg from each walker). 

So, the total number of legs involving Mariel, the other dog walker, and their 3 dogs is given by the equation:

\[ x \cdot 4 + 4 + 3 \cdot 4 \text{ (4 legs for the 3 dogs)} = 36 \]

Now we can solve for \( x \):

Let's denote the number of dogs Mariel is walking as \( d \). Mariel has 2 legs, and since dogs have 4 legs, each dog has 4 legs. There are a total of 36 legs, which includes Mariel's legs and the legs of the other dog walker and their 3 dogs.

The total legs from the other dog walker and their 3 dogs is \( 4 \times 3 + 2 = 14 \) (since the other dog has 14 legs, and the other 3 dogs have 12 legs).

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 2 + 14 + 4d = 36 \]

Let's solve for \( d \):

<reasoning>
Let's assume that Mariel is walking \( x \) dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, Mariel's dogs contribute \( 4x \) legs to the count.

The other dog walker is also walking dogs, contributing to the count of legs as well. Let's call the number of dogs the other walker is walking \( y \). The other walker's dogs contribute \( 4y \) legs.

We know that together, there are 36 legs, and considering the leashes, there are 4 legs for each dog, so the total number of dogs (including Mariel's and the other walker's) is \( x + y \).

The total number of legs can be expressed as:
\[ 4x + 4y = 36 \]

Since each walker is walking at least one dog, \( x \) and \( y \) are at least 1. We can simplify the equation by dividing through by 4:
\[ x + y = 9 \]

We also know that since each dog has 4 legs and there are 3 dogs tangled up, each of the three dogs is tied to another dog or to Mariel, so the total number of legs for the combined walkers (along with Mariel's dogs) is indeed 36. 

Since no additional details about the other dogs walking with Mariel are provided, let's assume he is also walking 1 dog for the sake of simplicity (but it could be different, so let's not assume the other walker has exactly 1 dog). This means that Mariel is walking 5 dogs (an additional dog to the original 5 from her list).

Therefore, \( x = 5 \).

Thus, Mariel is walking 5 dogs.

Reasoning:

Let's denote the number of dogs Mariel is walking as \( x \). 

1. Mariel has 2 legs, and as a human, she contributes 2 legs to the team.
2. Each of the dogs in her pack has 4 legs.
3. There are 3 dogs walking with the other dog walker, and each of these dogs has 4 legs.

The total number of legs is given as 36. This includes:
- Mariel's 2 legs
- \( 4x \) legs from the \( x \) dogs she's walking
- \( 3 \times 4 \) legs from the 3 dogs she's tangled with

This can be expressed as:
\[ 2 + 4x + 3 \times 4 = 36 \]

Let's solve this equation for \( x \):
\[ 2 + 4x + 12 = 36 \]
\[ 4x + 14 = 36 \]
\[ 4x = 22 \]
\[ x = 5.5 \]

Since the number of dogs must be a whole number, this solution suggests a potential error in the setup or context of the problem, as typically the number of dogs in a pack would not naturally result in a fractional number. 

However, if we were to consider that the problem might be slightly different or have an error in the setup (which is common in such problems), or if we were dealing with a different context where fractional dogs are possible (which is not typically considered), we would need to verify the problem's constraints and possibly consider rounding to the nearest whole number if needed.

Since the original problem statement presents a scenario where the number of dogs in a pack naturally should result in a whole number, and this setup does not satisfy that condition with precise integer calculation, we must conclude that the problem as stated does not have a solution with whole numbers in a standard context.

</reasoning>
<answer>
Since solving the equation leads to a non-integer result, which is unusual for a realistic scenario, and the problem's setup seems to imply whole numbers, it suggests there might be an error in the problem's constraints or it's not possible under standard conditions with whole dogs.

Given the logical inconsistencies, we can conclude that the problem as stated does not have a valid whole number solution for the number of dogs Mariel is walking. 

The problem seems to have a contradiction in presenting a feasible scenario, particularly the total number of legs (36) and the number of dogs (which must be a whole number).

Therefore, without further clarification on the problem's constraints, it is not possible to provide a valid number of dogs within standard scenarios.

The true value of \( x \) based on the logical steps would likely be re-evaluated or adjusted if a valid scenario is to be considered, such as rounding or adjusting one of the assumptions.

system
First, let's identify the number of legs that Mariel and the other dog walker contribute to the total count of legs. Humans have 2 legs, and dogs have 4 legs, so humans have 1 * 2 = 2 legs, and the other dog walker has 1 * 2 = 2 legs, for a total of 2 + 2 = 4 legs. 

Each of the 4 remaining legs represents a dog, so we have 4 dogs tied up.

However, we also account for the 3 dogs that are tied up with the other dog walker's dogs. Thus, we have a total of 4 (Mariel's dogs) + 3 (the other walker's dogs, plus their dogs) = 7 dogs.

Since there are 36 legs in total, and we know that the 7 dogs from both sides have 28 legs, the remaining 8 legs must be from Mariel's dogs. Therefore, Mariel is walking 8 dogs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the legs involved:**
   - Mariel has 2 legs.
   - There are three dog walkers (Mariel and the other dog walker), so assuming each dog walker has 2 legs (for the human part), that makes 12 legs.
   - The three dogs each have 4 legs.

2. **Calculate the total number of legs:**
   - Mariel's legs: 2
   - Dog walkers' legs: 12
   - Dogs' legs: 3 * 4 = 12
   - Total legs: 2 (Mariel) + 12 (dog walkers) + 12 (dogs) = 26

3. **Determine the number of legs Mariel's dogs are contributing:**
   - Since Mariel has 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 36, we can subtract Mariel's 2 legs from the total to find the legs contributed by the dogs.
   - Total legs minus Mariel's legs: 36 - 2 = 34 legs

4. **Calculate the number of dogs Mariel is walking:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs, so to find the number of dogs, we divide the number of legs contributed by the dogs by 4: 34 / 4 = 8.5

Since Mariel can't be walking half a dog, it's clear there was a miscalculation or misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate:

- Correctly, Mariel's 2 legs should be part of the total, not subtracted.
- The correct way to calculate is to consider Mariel's 2 legs as part of the total count, which means we need to account for all legs (including Mariel's).

So, we should have:
   - Mariel's legs: 2
   - Dog walkers' legs: 12
   - Dogs' legs (accounting for Mariel's part): 34
   - Total legs including Mariel: 36

Given the correct calculation, we find:
   - The number of legs contributed by the dogs is 34.
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - Therefore, the number of dogs: 34 / 4 = 8.5, which should be rounded to 8 (since partial dogs are not possible).

So, Mariel is walking 8 dogs.

First, let's establish the number of legs that dogs and humans have. A dog has 4 legs, and a human has 2 legs. 

Now let's break down the equation:
- Mariel's legs are counted: 1
- Dog walker's legs are counted: 2
- Other dog walker and their 3 dogs are tangled: (1 human + 1 dog + 1 dog + 1 dog) = 3 legs each, so total legs for the dog walker and their 3 dogs is 3 * 4 = 12

Let x be the number of dogs Mariel is walking. Each dog has 4 legs, so this makes x * 4 legs for Mariel's dogs.

The total number of tangled legs is given as 36:
1 (Mariel's leg) + 2 (dog walker's legs) + 12 (other dog walker and their dogs) + 4x (Mariel's dogs) = 36

Combining like terms, we get: 
12 + 4x = 36

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 
4x = 24

Dividing by 4: 
x = 6

So Mariel is walking 6 dogs.

Let's denote the number of dogs Mariel is walking as \( d \), and the other dog walker and their 3 dogs as \( d+3 \). Each dog has 4 legs, and each person has 2 legs.

The total number of legs for Mariel's dogs is \( 4d \), and the total number of legs for the other dog walker and their dogs is \( 4(d+3) \). Adding the hands of the dog walkers (excluding the legs) gives us the total number of legs as follows:
\[ 4d + 4(d+3) + 2 = 4d + 4d + 12 + 2 = 8d + 14 \]

We know that the total number of legs is 36:
\[ 8d + 14 = 36 \]
Subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 8d = 22 \]
Divide by 8:
\[ d = \frac{22}{8} = 2.75 \]

Since \( d \) must be a whole number, let's check if there's a mistake or recheck the calculation:
\[ 8d + 14 = 36 \]
\[ 8d = 22 \]
This setup needs re-evaluation. The initial setup seems correct, but there could be a mistake in assumptions. Let's recheck the solution:
If Mariel walks 5 dogs, then:
The other dog walker and their 3 dogs would be 4 dogs.
So, \( d = 5 \) and \( d+3 = 8 \), which gives:
\[ 4d + 4(d+3) = 4(5) + 4(8) = 20 + 32 = 52 \]

This does not match the given total of 36 legs. Let's simplify the equation step by step without any errors:
\[ 8d + 14 = 36 \]
\[ 8d = 22 \]
\[ d = 5 \]

So, Mariel is walking 5 dogs.

To determine how many dogs Mariel is walking, we first need to establish the number of legs from the other dog walker and their dogs. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs each person has:** 
   - The other dog walker has 1 human and 3 dogs, so that's a total of \(1 + 3 = 4\) legs from the humans and dogs.
   
2. **Calculate the number of legs from the dogs:** 
   - Each dog has 4 legs, so the remaining dogs (after accounting for the humans) make up \(36 - 4 = 32\) legs. 

3. **Calculate the number of dogs:**
   - Since each dog has 4 legs, the number of dogs is \(32 \div 4 = 8\).

4. **Identify the number of legs Mariel has:** 
   - Mariel walks one human and Mariel's dogs, which means there are \(1 + 8 = 9\) dogs in total if Mariel is walking 8 dogs herself. 

5. **Calculate the total number of legs Mariel is involved with:**
   - Mariel's 9 dogs consist of \(1 + 8 = 9\) dogs, which are \(9 \times 4 = 36\) legs total.

Thus, Mariel is walking **8 dogs**.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Each dog has 4 legs.
2. Each person has 2 legs.

From the problem, we know that there are 36 legs tangled up in leashes. This includes Mariel and the other dog walker, as well as their dogs.

First, let's calculate the number of dogs and people involved:

- The dogs include Mariel's dogs and the other dog walker's dogs.
- The leg count for the dogs would be \( D_d \) for Mariel's dogs and \( D_w \) for the other dog walker's dogs.

So the total number of legs from the dogs is \( D_d + D_w \).

- Mariel's dogs and the other dog walker have 2 people each, so that's \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) legs (for the dogs and people).

Given that the total number of legs is 36, we can set up the equation:

\[ D_d + D_w + 4 = 36 \]

Now let's solve for \( D_d \) and \( D_w \):

\[ D_d + D_w = 32 \]

Since each dog has 4 legs:

\[ D_d \times 4 + D_w \times 4 = 36 \]

Simplifying:

\[ 4(D_d + D_w) = 32 \]
\[ 4 \times 32 = 36 \]
\[ 128 = 36 \]

This doesn't help us directly, so let's consider the number of people involved, which includes Mariel and the other dog walker. Each person has 2 legs, and we have 4 people in total (Mariel, the other dog walker, and their two dogs). Each person's 2 legs contribute 2 to the total count:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

So, the total number of legs from the people is 8.

Finally, the number of legs from the dogs (without considering them yet) is:

\[ 36 - 8 = 28 \]

Since each dog has 4 legs:

\[ D_d + D_w = 28 \]

Since \( D_d + D_w = 32 \), we can find out the number of dogs Mariel is walking:

\[ D_d = 32 - D_w \]

Now, we need to determine \( D_w \). Each dog walker's 3 dogs contribute to the count of legs:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, we subtract the 12 legs from the dogs' total:

\[ D_d = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, Mariel is walking 20 dogs.

Let's denote the number of dogs Mariel is walking as \( m \). Each dog has 4 legs, and there are also the 3 dogs walked by the other dog walker. Each of these 3 dogs also has 4 legs.

First, we calculate the number of legs for the 3 dogs walked by Mariel's companion:
\[ 3 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 12 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we have Mariel herself and the 3 dogs she is walking. Mariel has 4 legs, and the 3 additional dogs have:
\[ 2 \text{ legs/dog} + 4 \text{ legs} = 6 \text{ legs} \]

The total number of legs is 36, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \text{ (Mariel's legs)} + 12 \text{ (companion's dogs)} + 6 \text{ (Mariel's dogs)} = 36 \]
\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Thus, the 22 legs account for the tangled legs of the other walker, their dogs, and Mariel. That leaves us with 36 - 22 = 14 legs for Mariel's dogs. Mariel is walking 14 dogs in total because each dog has 4 legs and we have 14 legs from 14 dogs:
\[ 14 \text{ dogs} \div 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 3.5 \]

Since the number of dogs must be a whole number, there seems to be an inconsistency. However, if we consider it as a practical scenario, where the other dog walker has only 4 legs for their 3 dogs and Mariel has 4 legs plus 14 legs for her dogs, the only possibility is that Mariel is walking 3 dogs and the other walker is walking 3 dogs.

So, Mariel is walking 3 dogs.
