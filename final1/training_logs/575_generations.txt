system
To find the total number of apples Diane and Cecile bought, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many apples Diane bought:
   Since Diane bought 20 more apples than Cecile, and Cecile bought 15 apples, Diane bought \(15 + 20 = 35\) apples.

2. Calculate the total number of apples:
   The total number of apples is the sum of the apples bought by both Diane and Cecile, which is \(15 + 35 = 50\).

Thus, Diane and Cecile bought a total of 50 apples.

To find out how many apples Diane and Cecile bought altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many apples Diane bought. Since Diane bought twenty more apples than Cecile, and Cecile bought 15 apples, we calculate Diane's apples as follows:
   \[
   \text{Diane's apples} = \text{Cecile's apples} + 20 = 15 + 20 = 35
   \]

2. Now, add the number of apples bought by Diane and Cecile to find the total:
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = \text{Diane's apples} + \text{Cecile's apples} = 35 + 15 = 50
   \]

So, the total number of apples they bought altogether is 50.

system
To determine the total number of apples Diane and Cecile bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of apples Cecile bought.
   Cecile bought 15 apples.

2. Calculate the number of apples Diane bought.
   Since Diane bought twenty more apples than Cecile, we add 20 to the number of apples Cecile bought.
   \( 15 + 20 = 35 \)
   Therefore, Diane bought 35 apples.

3. Find the total number of apples bought by both Diane and Cecile.
   We add the number of apples Diane bought to the number of apples Cecile bought.
   \( 15 + 35 = 50 \)

So, the total number of apples bought by Diane and Cecile altogether is 50.

system
Let's denote the number of apples Diane bought as \( D \) and the number of apples Cecile bought as \( C \). According to the problem, Cecile bought 15 apples, so \( C = 15 \).

Diane bought twenty more apples than Cecile, so the number of apples Diane bought is \( D = C + 20 \). Substituting the value of \( C \) into the equation, we get:
\[ D = 15 + 20 \]
\[ D = 35 \]

Now, to find the total number of apples they bought together, we need to add the number of apples Cecile bought to the number of apples Diane bought:
\[ \text{Total apples} = C + D \]
\[ \text{Total apples} = 15 + 35 \]
\[ \text{Total apples} = 50 \]

Therefore, they bought 50 apples altogether.

To find out the total number of apples bought by both Diane and Cecile, we need to first determine how many apples Diane bought. Since Diane bought twenty more apples than Cecile and Cecile bought 15 apples, Diane bought \(15 + 20 = 35\) apples.

Now, to find the total number of apples, we add Cecile's and Diane's apples together: \(15 + 35 = 50\) apples.

Therefore, the total number of apples bought by both is 50.

system
To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many apples Diane bought. According to the information provided, Diane bought 20 more apples than Cecile.

1. Find out how many apples Diane bought:
\[ \text{Diane's apples} = \text{Cecile's apples} + 20 \]
\[ \text{Diane's apples} = 15 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Diane's apples} = 35 \]

Now we know Diane bought 35 apples and Cecile bought 15 apples.

2. Calculate the total number of apples bought by both Diane and Cecile by adding their quantities:
\[ \text{Total apples} = \text{Diane's apples} + \text{Cecile's apples} \]
\[ \text{Total apples} = 35 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total apples} = 50 \]

So, Diane and Cecile bought a total of 50 apples together.

To find the total number of apples bought by Diane and Cecile, we start by determining how many apples Diane bought.

1. The problem states that Cecile bought 15 apples.
2. Diane bought 20 more apples than Cecile.

Therefore, the number of apples Diane bought is:
\[ 15 \text{ apples (Cecile)} + 20 \text{ apples} = 35 \text{ apples (Diane)} \]

Now, to find the total number of apples bought by both Diane and Cecile together, we add the number of apples each bought:
\[ 15 \text{ apples (Cecile)} + 35 \text{ apples (Diane)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, Diane and Cecile bought a total of 50 apples altogether.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of apples bought by Diane and Cecile together. 

First, we know that Cecile bought 15 apples.

According to the problem, Diane bought twenty more apples than Cecile. Therefore, Diane bought:
\[ 15 (\text{Cecile's apples}) + 20 = 35 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apples bought by both Diane and Cecile together:
\[ 15 (\text{Cecile's apples}) + 35 (\text{Diane's apples}) = 50 \text{ apples} \]

Thus, the total number of apples they bought altogether is \( 50 \).

To find the total number of apples Diane and Cecile bought, we can start by determining the number of apples Diane bought. 

Given that Cecile bought 15 apples and Diane bought twenty more apples than Cecile, we can calculate the number of apples Diane bought as follows:

Number of apples Diane bought = Number of apples Cecile bought + 20
Number of apples Diane bought = 15 + 20
Number of apples Diane bought = 35

Now, to find the total number of apples they bought altogether, we add the number of apples each person bought:

Total number of apples = Number of apples Cecile bought + Number of apples Diane bought
Total number of apples = 15 + 35
Total number of apples = 50

Therefore, Diane and Cecile bought a total of 50 apples altogether.

To solve this, we first need to calculate the number of apples Diane bought. According to the information, Diane bought 20 more apples than Cecile, who bought 15 apples. So, Diane bought:

15 apples (Cecile's apples) + 20 apples = 35 apples (Diane's apples).

Now, to find out the total number of apples they bought altogether, we add Cecile's and Diane's apples together:

15 apples (Cecile's apples) + 35 apples (Diane's apples) = 50 apples.

Therefore, the total number of apples they bought altogether is 50.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane bought 20 more apples than Cecile. Since Cecile bought 15 apples, we can calculate how many apples Diane bought:
   Diane's apples = Cecile's apples + 20
   Diane's apples = 15 + 20 = 35 apples

2. Now we know how many apples both Diane and Cecile bought individually:
   - Diane bought 35 apples
   - Cecile bought 15 apples

3. To find the total number of apples they bought together, we add Diane's and Cecile's apples:
   Total apples = Diane's apples + Cecile's apples
   Total apples = 35 + 15 = 50 apples

Therefore, Diane and Cecile bought a total of 50 apples altogether.
