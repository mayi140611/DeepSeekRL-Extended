###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Five friends eat at a fast-food chain and order the following: 5 pieces of hamburger that cost $3 each; 4 sets of French fries that cost $1.20; 5 cups of soda that cost $0.5 each; and 1 platter of spaghetti that cost $2.7. How much will each of them pay if they will split the bill equally?

Let's calculate the total cost of the meal:

- 5 hamburgers: \(5 \times $3 = $15\)
- 4 sets of french fries: \(4 \times $1.20 = $4.80\)
- 5 cups of soda: \(5 \times $0.5 = $2.50\)
- 1 platter of spaghetti: $2.70

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\( $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25.00 \)

They are splitting the bill equally among 5 friends, so we need to divide the total cost by 5:
\( $25.00 \div 5 = $5.00 \)

Each of them will pay $5.00.

To find out how much each friend will pay, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items ordered and then divide it by the number of friends, which is 5.

Let's calculate the total cost:
- For hamburgers: 5 pieces at $3 each = 5 * $3 = $15
- For French fries: 4 sets at $1.20 each = 4 * $1.20 = $4.80
- For sodas: 5 cups at $0.5 each = 5 * $0.5 = $2.50
- For spaghetti: 1 platter at $2.7 = 1 * $2.7 = $2.70

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25.00

Now, let's divide the total cost by the number of friends (5):
Cost per friend = $25.00 / 5 = $5.00

So, each friend will pay $5.00 if they split the bill equally.

Reasoning:
To find out how much each friend will pay, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items ordered:
- 5 pieces of hamburger: 5 * $3 = $15
- 4 sets of French fries: 4 * $1.20 = $4.80
- 5 cups of soda: 5 * $0.5 = $2.50
- 1 platter of spaghetti: $2.70
Adding these amounts together:
$15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25
Now, we need to divide this total cost by the number of friends, which is 5:
$25 ÷ 5 = $5
Each friend will pay $5 if they split the bill equally.

To calculate how much each friend will pay, we first need to determine the total cost of the meal for all five friends.

1. The cost of 5 pieces of hamburger:
\[ 5 \text{ pieces} \times \$3 \text{ per piece} = \$15 \]

2. The cost of 4 sets of French fries:
\[ 4 \text{ sets} \times \$1.20 \text{ per set} = \$4.80 \]

3. The cost of 5 cups of soda:
\[ 5 \text{ cups} \times \$0.5 \text{ per cup} = \$2.50 \]

4. The cost of 1 platter of spaghetti:
\[ \$2.70 \]

Now, we add all the costs together to get the total bill:
\[ \$15 + \$4.80 + \$2.50 + \$2.70 = \$25 \]

Next, we divide the total bill by the number of friends to find out how much each friend will pay:
\[ \$25 \div 5 = \$5 \]

Therefore, each of them will pay $5 if they split the bill equally.

Now we add up all these costs to get the total bill:

Total bill = $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.7 = $25

Since the five friends are splitting the bill equally, we divide the total bill by the number of friends:

Amount each friend pays = Total bill / Number of friends = $25 / 5 = $5

Therefore, each friend will pay $5.

To determine how much each friend will pay if the bill is split equally, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items ordered by all five friends.

1. **Hamburgers:**
   - Total cost: \( 5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$3/\text{hamburger} = \$15 \)

2. **French fries:**
   - Total cost: \( 4 \text{ sets} \times \$1.20/\text{set} = \$4.80 \)

3. **Cups of soda:**
   - Total cost: \( 5 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$2.50 \)

4. **Spaghetti:**
   - Cost: \( \$2.70 \)

Next, we sum up the total cost of all items:
\[
\$15 + \$4.80 + \$2.50 + \$2.70 = \$25
\]

Now, we divide the total cost by the number of friends to find out how much each friend will pay:
\[
\frac{\$25}{5 \text{ friends}} = \$5 \text{ per friend}
\]

Therefore, each friend will pay $\boxed{5}$.

To find out how much each person will pay if the bill is split equally, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items ordered. Then, we divide the total cost by the number of friends, which is 5.

The cost of 5 pieces of hamburger is \( 5 \times 3 = \$15 \).

The cost of 4 sets of French fries is \( 4 \times 1.20 = \$4.80 \).

The cost of 5 cups of soda is \( 5 \times 0.5 = \$2.50 \).

The cost of 1 platter of spaghetti is \( 1 \times 2.7 = \$2.70 \).

The total cost of the bill is \( 15 + 4.80 + 2.50 + 2.70 = \$24.00 \).

Now, we divide the total cost by the number of friends to find out how much each person will pay: \( \frac{24}{5} = \$4.80 \).

Therefore, each friend will pay \$4.80.

To find out how much each friend will pay if they split the bill equally, we first need to calculate the total cost of the meal for all five friends.

For the hamburgers, the total cost is:
5 hamburgers * $3/hamburger = $15

For the French fries, the total cost is:
4 sets * $1.20/each = $4.80

For the soda, the total cost is:
5 cups * $0.5/each = $2.50

For the spaghetti, the cost is:
1 platter * $2.70/platter = $2.70

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total bill:
Total bill = $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25

To find out how much each friend will pay if they split the bill equally, we divide the total bill by the number of friends:
Amount each friend will pay = Total bill / Number of friends
Amount each friend will pay = $25 / 5
Amount each friend will pay = $5

So, each friend will pay $5 if they split the bill equally.

To determine how much each friend will pay, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the food items ordered. We can break this down as follows:

1. Cost of hamburgers: \(5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$3 \text{ per hamburger} = \$15\)
2. Cost of French fries: \(4 \text{ sets} \times \$1.20 \text{ per set} = \$4.80\)
3. Cost of sodas: \(5 \text{ sodas} \times \$0.50 \text{ per soda} = \$2.50\)
4. Cost of spaghetti: \(1 \text{ platter} \times \$2.70 \text{ per platter} = \$2.70\)

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total bill:

\[
\$15 + \$4.80 + \$2.50 + \$2.70 = \$25
\]

Next, we need to split this total bill equally among the five friends. Therefore, we divide the total bill by the number of friends:

\[
\frac{\$25}{5} = \$5

So, each friend will pay \$5.

To calculate the total cost of the bill, we first multiply the number of each item by its respective cost and then sum up:

Cost of French fries: 4 × $1.20 = $4.80
Cost of sodas: 5 × $0.50 = $2.50
Cost of spaghetti: $2.70

Total cost: $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25

There are 5 friends, so to divide the bill equally, each friend will pay:

Amount per person = Total cost / Number of people
Amount per person = $25 / 5
Amount per person = $5

So, each of them will pay $5 if they split the bill equally.

To determine how much each friend will pay, we first need to calculate the total cost of the order. 

1. **Cost of hamburgers:** 
   Each hamburger costs $3, and there are 5 hamburgers.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of hamburgers} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of French fries:**
   Each set of French fries costs $1.20, and there are 4 sets.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of French fries} = 4 \times 1.20 = 4.80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of soda:**
   Each cup of soda costs $0.50, and there are 5 cups.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of soda} = 5 \times 0.50 = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of spaghetti:**
   The platter of spaghetti costs $2.70.

Now, we sum up all these amounts to get the total bill:
\[
\text{Total bill} = 15 + 4.80 + 2.50 + 2.70 = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since there are 5 friends sharing the bill equally, we divide the total bill by 5:
\[
\text{Amount each friend pays} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ dollars}

Thus, each friend will pay $5.

The total cost for the hamburger is $15 because 5 pieces x $3 = $15. The total cost for the French fries is $4.8 because 4 x $1.2 = $4.8. The total cost for the soda is $2.5 because 5 x $0.5 = $2.5. The total cost for the platter of spaghetti is $2.7. So they ordered a total of $26 because $15 + $4.8 + $2.5 + $2.7 = $26.
