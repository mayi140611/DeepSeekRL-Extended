To calculate the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito, we need to consider the probabilities given and the effects of the vaccine.

First, let's break down the probabilities:
1. The probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito is 40%.
2. If bitten by an infected mosquito, the probability of getting infected with malaria is 50% (after taking the vaccine, this probability is reduced by 50%, but it's still 25% of the usual 50% chance without the vaccine).
3. The probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito is 20%.
4. If bitten by an infected mosquito, the probability of getting infected with Zika virus is 50%.

We can calculate the total chances of getting infected with either virus as follows:

1. Probability of getting infected with malaria: \( 0.25 \times 0.40 = 0.10 \) (or 10%)
2. Probability of getting infected with Zika virus: \( 0.20 \times 0.50 = 0.10 \) (or 10%)

So, the combined probability of getting infected with either virus is the sum of these probabilities:

\[ 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 \] (or 20%)

Thus, the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito is 20%.

system
To determine the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito, we need to calculate the probability of being infected with each virus and then sum these probabilities, adjusted for the different levels of infection risk.

1. **Probability of being infected with malaria before vaccination:**
   - 40% of mosquitos are infected with malaria.
   - The chance of getting infected with malaria after being bitten is 50%.

   The probability of Jack being bitten by an infected mosquito with malaria is \(0.40\), and the probability of Jack getting infected with malaria after being bitten by such a mosquito is \(0.50\). Therefore, the total probability of Jack being infected with malaria is:
   \[
   0.40 \times 0.50 = 0.20 \text{ or } 20\%
   \]

2. **Probability of being infected with Zika virus after vaccination:**
   - 20% of mosquitos are infected with Zika virus.
   - The chance of getting infected with Zika virus after being bitten is 50%.

   The probability of Jack being bitten by an infected mosquito with Zika virus is \(0.40\), and the probability of Jack getting infected with Zika virus after being bitten by such a mosquito is \(0.50\). Therefore, the total probability of Jack being infected with Zika virus is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 0.50 = 0.10 \text{ or } 10\%
   \]

3. **Total probability of being infected with either virus:**
   - Jack can either get malaria or Zika virus, or both.
   - Let's denote the events for infection with malaria and Zika virus as \(M\) and \(Z\) respectively.
   - The probability of getting any of these infections is:
   \[
   P(M \cup Z) = P(M) + P(Z) - P(M \cap Z)
   \]

   Since getting infected with both malaria and Zika virus is not a possibility, \(P(M \cap Z) = 0\).

   Now, calculate \(P(M) = 0.20\) and \(P(Z) = 0.10\).

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(M \cup Z) = 0.20 + 0.10 = 0.30 \text{ or } 30\%
   \]

4. **Total infection risk with and without the vaccine:**
   - Without the vaccine, the overall infection risk (malaria or Zika virus) is 0.30.

   - With the vaccine, the effective infection risk is calculated by considering the reduction in risk due to the vaccine:
   \[
   0.30 \times (1 - 0.50) = 0.30 \times 0.50 = 0.15 \text{ or } 15\%
   \]

Therefore, Jack's percentage chance of getting infected with either Zika virus or malaria is \(15\%\).

To calculate the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria, we need to consider the different scenarios regarding mosquito infection status.

1. **No mosquito bite, and therefore no infection - 60% (100% - 40% - 20%)**
   - 60% x 100% = 60%

2. **Bitten by a mosquito with no infection - 40% (40%)**
   - 40% x 50% = 20%
   - 40% x 50% = 20%

3. **Bitten by a mosquito with infection only with malaria - 40% (40%)**
   - 40% x 50% = 20%
   - 40% x 50% = 20%

4. **Bitten by a mosquito with infection only with Zika virus - 20% (20%)**
   - 20% x 50% = 10%
   - 20% x 50% = 10%

5. **Bitten by a mosquito with infection with both - 20% (20%)**
   - 20% x 50% = 10%
   - 20% x 50% = 10%

To find the total percentage chance, we add up all these scenarios:

- 60% chance (no bite & no infection)
- 20% chance (bite only malaria)
- 20% chance (bite only Zika)
- 10% chance (bite malaria & Zika)
- 10% chance (bite malaria & Zika)

Total chance = 60% + 20% + 20% + 10% + 10% = 120%

Therefore, the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria is 120%.

To determine the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito, we need to consider the probabilities of being bitten by infected mosquitos and the impact of the vaccine on reducing the chance of infection.

1. First, calculate the probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito:
   - There are four types of mosquitos:
     - 40% infected with malaria
     - 20% infected with Zika virus
     - 40% uninfected with either virus

   - Probability of a mosquito being infected with malaria: \( 0.4 \)
   - Probability of a mosquito being infected with Zika virus: \( 0.2 \)
   - Probability of a mosquito not being infected: \( 0.4 \)

2. Jack gets bitten by a random mosquito:

3. Calculate the probability of Jack being infected with malaria or Zika virus using the provided information:
   - Since the vaccine reduces the chances of getting infected after getting bitten by 50%, the percent chance of Jack getting infected remains the same as before: \( 50\% \)

4. Add the probabilities of both events:
   - Probability of Jack getting infected with malaria: \( 0.4 \times 0.5 = 0.2 \)
   - Probability of Jack getting infected with Zika virus: \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \)

5. Calculate the total percentage chance of Jack getting infected with either Zika virus or malaria:
   - Total probability of infection: \( 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3 \)

6. Convert to a percentage:
   - \( 0.3 \times 100\% = 30\% \)

Let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

1. **Percentage chance of getting infected by a mosquito infected with malaria:**
   - 40% (40%) = 0.4

2. **Percentage chance of getting infected by a mosquito infected with Zika virus:**
   - 20% (20%) = 0.2

3. **Percentage chance of getting infected after being bitten by an infected mosquito (without the experimental vaccine):**
   - 50% (50%) = 0.5

4. **Percentage chance of getting infected after being bitten by a mosquito with the experimental vaccine:**
   - 50% (50%) = 0.5 (since the vaccine reduces it by 50%)
   
   Therefore, the overall chance of getting infected by a mosquito with the experimental vaccine is:

   \[
   0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \text{ (25%)}
   \]

5. **Total chance of getting infected by a mosquito (either with the vaccine or without):**
   - Without the vaccine: 
     - Chances of getting infected by malaria (0.4) + chances of getting infected by Zika (0.2) = 0.6
   - With the vaccine:
     - Chances of getting infected by malaria (0.4) * 0.25 (because 25% of the mosquitos are infected with malaria) + chances of getting infected by Zika (0.2) * 0.25 = 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15

   Adding these together gives the total chance of getting infected by a mosquito:

   \[
   0.6 + 0.15 = 0.75 \text{ (75%)}
   \]

6. **Probability of catching either Zika virus or malaria:**
   - This is the sum of the chances of getting bitten by an infected mosquito infected with malaria and the chances of getting bitten by an infected mosquito infected with Zika:
   
   \[
   0.75 + 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

Concluding:
There seems to be an error in the problem assumptions as the result exceeds 100%, which is impossible. There might be an error in the calculations or the interpretation of the problem. Please review the details and ensure the context and all percentages are accurate.

<answer>
1.50
</answer>
<reasoning>
The percentages provided in the problem lead to a total probability of catching either Zika virus or malaria exceeding 100%, indicating an error in the problem setup or the calculations. Let's review:

1. 40% chance of a mosquito being infected with malaria (0.4).
2. 20% chance a mosquito is infected with Zika (0.2).
3. 50% chance of an infected mosquito causing infection without a vaccine (0.5).
4. 50% chance of an infected mosquito causing infection with the vaccine (0.25).

The experimental malaria vaccine reduces infection by 50%, meaning the vaccine reduces the infection chances by 0.5 times, from 50% to 25%.

Combining these, we get:
- Without the vaccine: 
  - Chance of getting infected by malaria = 0.4 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.2
  - Chance of getting infected by Zika = 0.2 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.1

- With the vaccine:
  - Chance of getting infected by malaria = 0.4 * 0.25

system
To calculate the percentage chance of Jack catching either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito, we need to consider the different factors involved.

1. **Probability of Being Bitten by Infected Mosquito**: Since 40% of the mosquitos are infected with malaria and 20% are infected with Zika, the total percentage of infected mosquitos is 40% + 20% = 60%.

2. **Effect of Malaria Vaccine**: Jack is taking a vaccine that reduces the chances of getting infected after being bitten by 50%. To keep it simple, the vaccine's effect is applied directly to the probabilities of being bitten by infected mosquitoes. Without the vaccine, the probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito is 60%, and the probability of catching malaria (even without the vaccine) is 50%.

3. **Probability of Catching Malaria After Vaccination**: Since the vaccine reduces the chances of getting infected to half (with a 50% chance of catching malaria without the vaccine), the effectiveness of catching malaria is now 50%.

4. **Probability of Catching Zika After Vaccination**: The probability of being bitten by a Zika-infected mosquito remains 20%, as these infections are solely the result of vector-borne transmission and the effectiveness of the vaccine would not apply here as it pertains to the rate of infection within a mosquito rather than the chances of being bitten by a mosquito.

Now, to calculate the total percentage chance of Jack catching either Zika or malaria, we can use the binomial probability formula:

\[ P(\text{catch either}) = P(\text{catch malaria}) + P(\text{catch Zika}) - P(\text{catch both}) \]

Given:
\[ P(\text{catch malaria}) = 50\% \]
\[ P(\text{catch Zika}) = 20\% \]

Now, we calculate the probability of catching both malaria and Zika, assuming that being bitten by both infected mosquitoes increases the likelihood of both being caught:

\[ P(\text{catch both}) = P(\text{catch malaria}) \times P(\text{catch Zika}) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Finally, we use the formula to find the probability of catching either Zika or malaria:

\[ P(\text{catch either}) = 0.5 + 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.6 \]

The percentage chance is then:
\[ 0.6 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

So, Jack has a 60% chance of catching either Zika or malaria after being bitten by a random infected mosquito.

To calculate the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito, we need to consider the probabilities of being infected with each virus.

1. **Percentage chance of acquiring malaria:** 40%
2. **Percentage chance of acquiring Zika:** 20%
3. **Chance of acquiring either virus given a bite:** 50% (since the chances of getting infected with either virus after being bitten are 50%)
4. **Chance of acquiring malaria after vaccination:** 50% - 50% = 0% (since the vaccine reduces the chances of acquiring malaria from 50% to 0% due to 50% reduction)
5. **Chance of acquiring Zika after vaccination:** 50% (as the vaccine has no effect on the chance of acquiring Zika)

Now, we can calculate the overall percentage chance of acquiring either virus:
- The chance of acquiring malaria first, then Zika: \(0.4 \times 0.5 = 0.2\).
- The chance of acquiring Zika first, then malaria: \(0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1\).

Adding these probabilities together:
\[0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3\]

Converting to percentage:
\[0.3 \times 100\% = 30\%\]

So, the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria is **30%**.

To calculate the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria, we first need to determine the individual chances of catching each virus after being bitten by a mosquito. 

Firstly, the chances of catching malaria after being bitten by an infected mosquito are 40%, and this is further reduced by the vaccine, which reduces the chances of 50%, so the chance of catching malaria is 0.40 * 0.50 = 0.20 = 20%.

For Zika virus, the chance is 20%, and this is also reduced by the vaccine, so the chance of getting Zika is 0.20 * 0.50 = 0.10 = 10%.

The total percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria is the sum of the probabilities of catching each virus, because we are treating these as mutually exclusive events. 

Therefore, the total percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria is 20% + 10% = 30%.

To determine the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the infection chance due to the mosquito bite:**

   - Mosquitoes carrying malaria: 40%
   - Mosquitoes carrying Zika virus: 20%

   Let's assume that the mosquito bite has an equal probability of being infected with either virus if it is bitten by a mosquito that is infected.

2. **Adjust the infection chance due to the vaccine:**

   - Without vaccine: 50% chance of getting infected with either virus if bitten by an infected mosquito.
   - Vaccine reduces the infection chance by 50%.

   Therefore, the adjusted chance of getting infected with malaria is:
   \[
   50\% \times 50\% = 25\%
   \]

   The adjusted chance of getting infected with Zika virus is:
   \[
   50\% \times 50\% = 25\%
   \]

3. **Add the adjusted chances:**

   - Malaria infection with vaccine: 25%
   - Zika virus infection with vaccine: 25%

   Total chance of getting infected with either virus is:
   \[
   25\% + 25\% = 50\%

Therefore, the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito is \( \boxed{50} \)%.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the probabilities of being bitten by an infected mosquito and the additional protective effect of the malaria vaccine.

1. Probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito: 40%.
2. Probability of being infected with malaria after being bitten: 50% (since the probability of being infected with malaria is 40% and the 50% chance of getting infected after being bitten by the malaria vaccine reduces that chance).
3. Probability of being infected with Zika virus after being bitten: 20% (since the probability of being infected with Zika virus is 20%).
4. The probability of getting infected with either virus (Zika or malaria) after being bitten by an infected mosquito is the sum of the individual probabilities, assuming independence. However, since 50% of the mosquitoes are infected with malaria and 20% with Zika, only infected mosquitoes need to be considered for the infection calculation.

Let's denote:
- P(Malaria) = 0.40 (probability of an infected mosquito)
- P(Zika) = 0.20 (probability of an infected mosquito with Zika)

Jack's overall chances of infection depend on the mosquito's infection status:
- The percentage chance of catching Zika virus (Z) is P(Z) = 0.20 * 50% = 0.20 * 0.50 = 0.10 = 10%
- The percentage chance of catching malaria (M) is P(M) = 0.40 * 50% = 0.40 * 0.50 = 0.20 = 20%

Since these events occur independently, we use the addition rule for probabilities of mutually exclusive events to find the total percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria:

Total infection chance = P(Z) + P(M) = 0.10 + 0.20 = 0.30 = 30%

Therefore, the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria is 30%.

@extends user to think about the problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the probabilities given:**
   - 40% of mosquitos are infected with malaria.
   - 20% of mosquitos are infected with Zika virus.
   - The probability of getting infected with both diseases after being bitten by an infected mosquito is \(50\%\).

2. **Determine the individual probabilities of getting infected with each disease independently:**
   - Since 50% of bites lead to infection, and 50% of these bites are from mosquitoes already infected with the other disease, we need to calculate the direct infection rates for each disease.
   - Let's denote the probability of getting infected with malaria as \(P(M)\) and with Zika as \(P(Z)\).
   - Given the 50% infection rate after a bite and the combined infection rate of 50%, we infer that 50% of the rate is due to mixed-bite infection, which simplifies to:
     \[
     P(M) = \frac{40\%}{2} = 20\% + 10\% = 30\%
     \]
     (30% from malaria infection and 10% from mixed infection, where 50% is due to the combined rate being 50% overall.)
     \[
     P(Z) = 20\% \text{ (as given in the problem)}
     \]

3. **Calculate the probabilities of infection with only malaria and only Zika:**
   - Probability of getting infected with only malaria:
     \[
     P(M \text{ only}) = 30\% \times (1 - 0.5) = 30\% \times 0.5 = 15\%
     \]
     (Since 50% of bites lead to infection overall, 30% are from malaria alone.)

   - Probability of getting infected with only Zika:
     \[
     P(Z \text{ only}) = 20\% \times (1 - 0.5) = 20\% \times 0.5 = 10\%
     \]

4. **Calculate the combined probability of being infected with either disease:**
   - Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events:
     \[
     P(M \text{ or } Z) = P(M \text{ only}) + P(Z \text{ only}) + P(M \text{ and } Z)
     \]
     \[
     P(M \text{ or } Z) = 15\% + 10\% + 50\%
     \]
     \[
     P(M \text{ or } Z) = 75\%
     \]

5. **Verify if the combined probability makes sense given the independent infection rates:**
   - The combined probability of 75% should account for the overall infection rate and the mixed infection rate.
   - The calculation ensures that 30% from pure malaria and 20% from pure Zika, plus the additional 50% from mixed bites, add up correctly to 75%.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito is \(75\% \).

To calculate the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after getting bitten by a random infected mosquito, we need to consider the probabilities of each virus being contracted and the effect of the vaccine on the malaria infection.

1. **Malaria Probability:**
   - 40% of mosquitos are infected with malaria.
   - 50% chance of infection after biting an infected mosquito without the vaccine.

2. **Zika Virus Probability:**
   - 20% of mosquitos are infected with Zika virus.
   - 50% chance of infection after biting an infected mosquito without the vaccine.

3. **Malaria After Vaccine:**
   - The vaccine reduces the malaria infection chance to 50%.

To find the total probability of Jack contracting either malarial or Zika virus after being bitten, we need to consider the probability of biting an infected mosquito and then the probability of contracting either virus given the mosquito's infection, multiplied by the probability of biting that mosquito without the vaccine.

- **Total Probability:**
  - Probability of biting an infected mosquito is 40% or 0.40.
  - Chance of contracting malaria after biting an infected mosquito without vaccine is 50% or 0.50.

So, the total probability of catching malaria (considering the vaccine) is:
\[ 0.40 \times 0.50 = 0.20 = 20\% \]

- **Probability of biting an infected Zika mosquito:**
  - This is 20% or 0.20.

- **Probability of contracting Zika virus after biting an infected mosquito without vaccine:**
  - This is 50% or 0.50.

So, the total probability of catching Zika virus (considering the vaccine) is:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.50 = 0.10 = 10\% \]

Combining these probabilities, the overall percentage chance Jack catches either Zika or malaria after being bitten is:
- Total probability of catching malaria or Zika virus: 20% (malaria) + 10% (Zika) = 30%.

Therefore, the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after getting bitten by a random infected mosquito is 30%.

reason
To find the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria, we need to consider the probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito and the specific conditions of infection after being bitten.

1. First, let’s find the probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito.
   - Malaria is 40% infected: \( 0.40 \)
   - Zika is 20% infected: \( 0.20 \)
   - Probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito: \( 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.06 \)

2. Now, the probability of getting infected with either Zika or malaria depends on whether Jack was bitten by an infected mosquito and whether his vaccination helped reduce the chances of getting infected.
   - Without the vaccine, the probability of getting infected (Zika or malaria) after being bitten by an infected mosquito is 50%, or 0.50.
   - With the vaccine, the chance of getting infected is reduced by 50%, so it would be \( 0.50 \times 0.50 = 0.25 \).

3. We can now calculate the total probability of getting infected with either Zika or malaria by multiplying the probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito by the probability of infection with that mosquito’s virus.
   - Total probability of getting infected = Probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito \(\times\) Probability of infection after being bitten
   - Total probability: \( 0.06 \times 0.050 + 0.06 \times 0.25 = 0.003 + 0.015 = 0.018 \)

4. To get percentage, we multiply the total probability by 100:
   - Percentage chance = \( 0.018 \times 100 = 1.8\% \)

2. Determine the chance of Jack getting infected with malaria after being bitten by an infected mosquito.
3. Determine the chance of Jack getting infected with Zika virus after being bitten by an infected mosquito.
4. Calculate the overall chance of Jack getting infected with either virus, considering the vaccine's effect.

Step 1: Probability of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.
- 40% of mosquitos are infected with malaria, and 20% are infected with Zika.
- Probability of a mosquito being infected is \(0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6\).
- Probability of Jack getting bitten by an infected mosquito is \(0.6\).

Step 2: Probability of getting infected with malaria.
- Without the vaccine, the chance of infection is 50%.
- With the vaccine, the chance of infection is reduced by 50%, so the chance is \(50\% \times 0.5 = 25\%\).

Step 3: Probability of getting infected with Zika.
- Without the vaccine, the chance of infection is 50%.
- With the vaccine, the chance of infection is reduced by 50%, so the chance is \(50\% \times 0.5 = 25\%\).

Step 4: Calculate the overall chance of getting infected with either virus.
- The overall chance of getting infected with either virus is the sum of the chances of getting infected with malaria and Zika, assuming the events are independent.
- Probability of getting infected with either virus is \(25\% + 25\% = 50\%\).

Thus, the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria is 50%.

To find the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito, we need to consider the different scenarios and their probabilities.

Let's denote the following:
- \( P(\text{Malaria}) = 0.40 \) (40% of mosquitos are infected with malaria)
- \( P(\text{Zika}) = 0.20 \) (20% of mosquitos are infected with Zika)
- \( P(\text{Infected}|\text{Malaria}) = 0.50 \) (50% chance of getting infected with malaria after being bitten by a malaria-infected mosquito)
- \( P(\text{Infected}|\text{Zika}) = 0.50 \) (50% chance of getting infected with Zika after being bitten by a Zika-infected mosquito)

First, we calculate the probability of getting infected with either disease after being bitten by a random mosquito. This is given by the formula for the total probability of union of two events:

\[ P(\text{Infected}) = P(\text{Malaria}) \cdot P(\text{Infected}|\text{Malaria}) + P(\text{Zika}) \cdot P(\text{Infected}|\text{Zika}) \]

\[ P(\text{Infected}) = 0.40 \cdot 0.50 + 0.20 \cdot 0.50 \]

\[ P(\text{Infected}) = 0.20 + 0.10 = 0.30 \] 

So the probability that Jack gets infected with either disease after being bitten by a random mosquito is 30%.

However, we need to find the percentage chance that he catches either Zika virus or malaria. This is given by the formula for the probability of union of two events:

\[ P(\text{Zika or Malaria}) = P(\text{Zika}) + P(\text{Malaria}) - P(\text{Zika and Malaria}) \]

Since the diseases are independent, the probability that Jack gets infected with both diseases is:

\[ P(\text{Zika and Malaria}) = P(\text{Zika}) \cdot P(\text{Malaria}) \]

\[ P(\text{Zika and Malaria}) = 0.20 \cdot 0.40 = 0.08 \]

So:

\[ P(\text{Zika or Malaria}) = 0.20 + 0.40 - 0.08 \]

\[ P(\text{Zika or Malaria}) = 0.32 \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria is 32%.

To find the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito:**
   - 40% of the mosquitos are infected with malaria.
   - 20% of the mosquitos are infected with Zika virus.
   - Therefore, the total percentage of infected mosquitos is \(40\% + 20\% = 60\%\).

2. **Probability of getting infected with malaria if bitten:**
   - Without the vaccine, the chance of getting infected with malaria after being bitten by an infected mosquito is 50%.

3. **Probability of getting infected with Zika virus after being bitten:**
   - Without the vaccine, the chance of getting infected with Zika virus after being bitten by an infected mosquito is 50%.

4. **Effect of the vaccine:**
   - The vaccine reduces the chance of getting infected with malaria by 50%, so the chance of getting malaria after being bitten by an infected mosquito is \(50\% \times 0.5 = 25\%\).

5. **Probability of getting infected with either virus:**
   - Probability of getting malaria after being bitten by an infected mosquito: 25%
   - Probability of getting Zika virus after being bitten by an infected mosquito: 50%
   - Since being bitten by an infected mosquito means the mosquito is either malaria or Zika (or both), we can add the two probabilities because being bitten by an infected mosquito cannot result in both infections simultaneously without considering each separately, and the conditions fit our independent event scenario.

Now, let’s combine the probabilities:
- Probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito: 60% (0.6)
- Probability of getting malaria after getting bitten: 25% (0.25)
- Probability of getting Zika virus after getting bitten: 50% (0.5)
- Total probability of getting either Zika virus or malaria is:
  \[
  0.6 \times 0.25 + (1 - 0.6) \times 0.5 = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \text{ or } 35\%.
  \]

Therefore, the percentage chance Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria is 35%.
