#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To find the average time per kilometer, we need to divide the total time by the total distance.

Total time = 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes
Distance = 10 kilometers

Average time per kilometer = Total time / Distance
Average time per kilometer = 50 minutes / 10 kilometers = 5 minutes/kilometer

To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we need to add up the total time he took to run the race and divide it by the total number of kilometers he ran.

The race is 10 kilometers long, so TJ ran a total of 10 kilometers.

He ran the first 5 kilometers in 20 minutes and the second 5 kilometers in 30 minutes. Therefore, his total time for the race is 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Now, to find the average time per kilometer, we divide the total time by the total distance:

\[ \text{Average time per kilometer} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Total distance}} \]

\[ \text{Average time per kilometer} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ kilometers}} \]

\[ \text{Average time per kilometer} = 5 \text{ minutes per kilometer} \]

So, the average time per kilometer for TJ's race was 5 minutes.

To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we first need to calculate the total time he took to complete the race and then divide that time by the total number of kilometers.

1. From the problem, we know that TJ ran the first half (5km) in 20 minutes. Therefore, the time taken for the first half is 20 minutes, which is 1/3 of an hour.
   
2. Then, he ran the second half (5km) in 30 minutes. Therefore, the time taken for the second half is 30 minutes, which is 1/2 hour.

3. Adding the time taken for both halves together, the total time is:
   \( 20 \, \text{minutes} + 30 \, \text{minutes} = 50 \, \text{minutes} \)

4. Since there are 10 kilometers in the race, we divide the total time by 10 kilometers to get the average time per kilometer:
   \( \frac{50 \, \text{minutes}}{10 \, \text{kilometers}} = 5 \, \text{minutes per kilometer} \)

So, TJ's average time per kilometer is 5 minutes.

To find the average time per kilometer, we first need to calculate the total time TJ took to complete the race. 

1. The first half of the race was 20 minutes, and the second half was 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time is:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Since the race is 10 kilometers long, we divide the total time by the number of kilometers to find the average time per kilometer:
   \[
   \text{Average time per kilometer} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ kilometers}} = 5 \text{ minutes per kilometer}
   \]

3. Assuming TJ covered the kilometers evenly, the average time per kilometer is:
   \[
   \text{Average time per kilometer} = 5 \text{ minutes per kilometer}
   \]

4. Verify the calculation:
   - The total distance is 10 kilometers.
   - He took 20 minutes for the first half.
   - He took 30 minutes for the second half.
   - Total time is \(20 + 30 = 50\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the average time per kilometer is \(\frac{50}{10} = 5\) minutes per kilometer.

Jill likes to collect cat stickers. She has 16 cat stickers. She has x times as many dog stickers as cat stickers. Jill has 28 dog stickers. We can find the value of \(x\) by setting up an equation based on the information provided.

1. Jill's cat stickers are 16.
2. She has \(x\) times as many dog stickers as cat stickers. 
3. We know she has 28 dog stickers.

The equation to represent the relationship between cat stickers and dog stickers is:
\[ \text{Number of cat stickers} \times x = \text{Number of dog stickers} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 16x = 28 \]

To solve for \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 16:
\[ x = \frac{28}{16} \]
\[ x = 1.75 \]

Therefore, \(x\) is 1.75.

To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we first need to calculate the total time he took to run the race and then divide it by the total distance he covered. 

1. The race is 10 kilometers, so we need to divide the total time by 10.

2. The total time taken is the sum of the time taken for the first half and the second half:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Now, we divide the total time by 10 to find the average time per kilometer:
   \[
   \text{Average time per kilometer} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{10} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{10} = 5 \text{ minutes per kilometer}

To calculate TJ's average time per kilometer, we first need to determine the total distance and the total time he took to complete the race.

TJ ran 10 kilometers (5 kilometers each half) and it took him a total of 20 minutes for the first half and 30 minutes for the second half, which adds up to 50 minutes.

The average time per kilometer is then calculated by dividing the total time by the total distance and converting the total time into a per kilometer rate.

50 minutes / 10 kilometers = 5 minutes per kilometer

Jared traveled a total time of 50 minutes. To find the average speed, we convert the total time to minutes per hour by dividing by 60 (since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes). We then divide the total distance (10 kilometers or 10,000 meters) by the average time per kilometer in hours to get a speed in meters per kilometer.

1 hour / 60 minutes = 0.0167 per minute.
10,000 meters / 5 minutes = 2000 meters per minute.

Jared's average speed was 2000 meters per minute = 13.3333 kilometers per hour.

To calculate TJ's average time per kilometer, we first need to determine the total time he took to complete the race and then divide that by the total number of kilometers.

1. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - Time for the first half (5 km): 20 minutes  
   - Time for the second half (5 km): 30 minutes
   - Total time = 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes

2. **Total Kilometers:**
   - Total distance = 10 km

3. **Average Time per Kilometer:**

To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we need to consider the total time he took to complete the race and the total distance.

Here's the reasoning:
- TJ ran a total of 10 kilometers.
- He completed the first half in 20 minutes.
- He completed the second half in 30 minutes.
- Therefore, the total time is \(20 + 30 = 50\) minutes.
- The average time per kilometer is the total time divided by the total distance, which is \(50 / 10 = 5\) minutes per kilometer.

To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we first need to calculate the total time he spent running the race and then divide that by the number of kilometers he ran.

Jen ran the first half in 20 minutes. Since the race is 10 kilometers, the first half covers 5 kilometers.
Jen ran the second half in 30 minutes. The second half also covers 5 kilometers.

Total time in minutes: 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.
Total distance in kilometers: 5 + 5 = 10 kilometers.

Now, we calculate the average time per kilometer:
Average time per kilometer = Total time / Total distance
= 50 minutes / 10 kilometers
= 5 minutes/kilometer

So, the average time per kilometer was 5 minutes.

First, we need to determine the total time TJ spent running the race. Since he ran a 10K race, this means the total distance is 10 kilometers.

He completed the first half, which is 5 kilometers, in 20 minutes. For the second half, which is also 5 kilometers, he took 30 minutes. So, the total time taken is 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

To find the average time per kilometer, divide the total time by the total distance:

\[ \text{Average time per kilometer} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Total distance}} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ km}} = 5 \text{ minutes per km} \]

To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we first need to calculate the total time he took for the entire race and then divide it by the number of kilometers he covered.

TJ ran the first half in 20 minutes, which is 10 kilometers. The second half was completed in 30 minutes, covering the remaining 10 kilometers.

Total time for the race = Time for the first half + Time for the second half
Total time for the race = 20 minutes + 30 minutes
Total time for the race = 50 minutes

Total distance covered = 10 kilometers (first half) + 10 kilometers (second half)
Total distance covered = 20 kilometers

Average time per kilometer = Total time for the race / Total distance covered
Average time per kilometer = 50 minutes / 20 kilometers

Now, let's calculate the average time per kilometer:

Average time per kilometer = 50 / 20
Average time per kilometer = 2.5 minutes per kilometer

So, TJ's average time per kilometer was 2.5 minutes.
