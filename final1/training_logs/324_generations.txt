Let's break down the steps needed to calculate the total amount of money Legacy makes from cleaning all the floors in the building:

1. First, calculate the total number of rooms in the building. The building has 4 floors with 10 rooms each, so we multiply the number of floors by the number of rooms per floor:
   Total rooms = 4 floors * 10 rooms/floor = 40 rooms

2. Next, since Legacy takes 6 hours to clean one room and she earns $15 per hour, we can calculate her hourly rate for cleaning:
   Cleaning rate = $15/hour * 6 hours = $90/hour

3. Now, to find out how much Legacy earns per room, we multiply the rate she earns per hour by the number of hours it takes her to clean one room:
   Room cleaning rate = $90/hour * 6 hours = $540 per room

4. Finally, to find her total earnings from cleaning all the rooms in the building, we multiply her room cleaning rate by the total number of rooms:
   Total earnings = $540/room * 40 rooms = $21,600

Therefore, Legacy makes a total of $21,600 from cleaning all the floors in the building.

To calculate the total amount of money Legacy makes from cleaning the building floors, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rooms in the building:**
   - The building has 4 floors.
   - Each floor has 10 rooms.
   - Total rooms = Floors × Rooms per floor = 4 × 10 = 40 rooms.

2. **Calculate the total timeLegacy spends cleaning:**
   - Legacy takes 6 hours to clean one room.
   - Total cleaning time = Total rooms × Time per room = 40 × 6 = 240 hours.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Legacy makes:**
   - Legacy earns $15 per hour.
   - Total earnings = Total hours × Hourly rate = 240 × 15 = $3600.

Legacy has to clean all the rooms in four floors, so she has to clean \(4 \times 10 = 40\) rooms in total. It takes her 6 hours to clean one room, so it will take her \(40 \times 6 = 240\) hours to clean all the rooms.

She earns $15 per hour, so the total amount of money she makes from cleaning all the rooms is \(240 \times 15 = \$3600\).

- Total time spent cleaning all rooms = 40 rooms * 6 hours/room = 240 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
- Legacy earns $15 per hour.
- Total earnings = 240 hours * $15/hour = $3600.

Final answer: Legacy makes $3600 from cleaning all the floors in the building.

To calculate the total amount of money Legacy makes from cleaning all the floors in the building, we need to start by determining the total number of rooms in the building first.

Each floor has 10 rooms, and there are 4 floors in total. Therefore, the total number of rooms in the building is:
10 rooms/floor * 4 floors = 40 rooms

Now, we know that it takes Legacy 6 hours to clean one room. To find out how long it takes her to clean all 40 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean one room:
40 rooms * 6 hours/room = 240 hours

Legacy earns $15 per hour of work. To calculate her total earnings, we multiply the total number of hours by her hourly wage:
240 hours * $15/hour = $3600

Therefore, Legacy makes $3600 from cleaning all the floors in the building.
