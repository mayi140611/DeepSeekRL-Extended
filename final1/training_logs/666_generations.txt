system
To find out how tall Gracie is, we start by calculating Grayson's height. We know that Grayson is 2 inches taller than Griffin, who is 61 inches tall. Therefore, Grayson's height is:
\[ 61 + 2 = 63 \text{ inches}. \]

Next, we find Gracie's height, which is 7 inches shorter than Grayson. So, Gracie's height is:
\[ 63 - 7 = 56 \text{ inches}. \]

Thus, Gracie is 56 inches tall.

To determine Gracie's height, we need to work backwards from Griffin's height.

1. Griffin is 61 inches tall.
2. Grayson is 2 inches taller than Griffin.
   - Grayson's height = Griffin's height + 2 inches = 61 inches + 2 inches = 63 inches.
3. Gracie is 7 inches shorter than Grayson.
   - Gracie's height = Grayson's height - 7 inches = 63 inches - 7 inches = 56 inches.

Therefore, Gracie is 56 inches tall.

To determine Gracie's height, we first need to establish the height of Grayson based on Griffin's height. We know that Griffin is 61 inches tall.

Since Grayson is 2 inches taller than Griffin, we calculate Grayson's height as follows:
\[ \text{Grayson's height} = \text{Griffin's height} + 2 = 61 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 63 \text{ inches} \]

Now that we know Grayson's height, we can determine Gracie's height, which is 7 inches shorter than Grayson's height:
\[ \text{Gracie's height} = \text{Grayson's height} - 7 = 63 \text{ inches} - 7 \text{ inches} = 56 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Gracie is 56 inches tall.

To find Gracie's height, we'll need to calculate the height of Grayson and then of Gracie.

1. Griffin is 61 inches tall.
2. Grayson is 2 inches taller than Griffin, so Grayson's height is:
   61 inches + 2 inches = 63 inches.
3. Gracie is 7 inches shorter than Grayson, so Gracie's height is:
   63 inches - 7 inches = 56 inches.

Therefore, Gracie is 56 inches tall.

To find Gracie's height, we need to follow the steps outlined.

1. First, calculate Grayson's height. Since Grayson is 2 inches taller than Griffin, we add 2 inches to Griffin's height:
   Grayson's height = Griffin's height + 2 inches
   Grayson's height = 61 inches + 2 inches = 63 inches

2. Next, determine Gracie's height. Gracie is 7 inches shorter than Grayson, so we subtract 7 inches from Grayson's height:
   Gracie's height = Grayson's height - 7 inches
   Gracie's height = 63 inches - 7 inches = 56 inches

Therefore, Gracie is 56 inches tall.
