Trevor needs to go downtown for a restaurant date. An Uber ride downtown costs $3 more than a Lyft ride. A Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride. The Uber ride costs $22. If Trevor takes a taxi downtown and tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride, what is the total cost of the ride downtown?

Let's denote the cost of the taxi ride as \( T \).

From the information given:
1. A Lyft ride costs \( T + 4 \) dollars.
2. An Uber ride costs \( T + 4 + 3 = T + 7 \) dollars.

We are told that the Uber ride costs $22, so \( T + 7 = 22 \). Solving for \( T \) gives:
\[ T = 22 - 7 \]
\[ T = 15 \]
So, the taxi ride costs $15.

Trevor tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride. Thus, the tip is:
\[ 15 \times 0.20 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the ride downtown is the sum of the original taxi ride cost and the tip:
\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the ride downtown is $18.

Let's denote the cost of each ride as follows:
- $T$ for the taxi ride
- $L$ for the Lyft ride 
- $U$ for the Uber ride

From the problem, we get the following equations based on the given information:
1. $U = L + 3$ (An Uber ride costs $3 more than a Lyft ride)
2. $L = T + 4$ (A Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride)
3. $U = 22$ (The Uber ride costs $22)

Using these equations, we can substitute $U$ into the first equation:
\[ 22 = L + 3 \]
\[ L = 22 - 3 \]
\[ L = 19 \]

Now, substituting $L$ into the second equation:
\[ 19 = T + 4 \]
\[ T = 19 - 4 \]
\[ T = 15 \]

So the taxi ride costs $15.

The tip is 20% of the original cost of the ride, which is $15. Therefore, the tip is:
\[ 0.2 \times 15 = 3 \]

The total cost of the ride, including the tip, is:
\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Thus, the total cost of the ride downtown, including the tip, is $18.

Let's denote the cost of a taxi ride by \( x \).

We know that a Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride, so the cost of a Lyft ride is \( x + 4 \).

An Uber ride costs $3 more than a Lyft ride, so the cost of an Uber ride is \( (x + 4) + 3 = x + 7 \).

We are given that the cost of an Uber ride is $22, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 7 = 22 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 22 - 7 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the cost of a taxi ride is $15.

Trevor tips 20% of the original cost of the taxi ride to the taxi driver. The tip amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times 15 = 3 \]

The total cost of the taxi ride including the tip is:
\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the ride downtown is $18.

First, we must find the cost of a Lyft ride, which is $4 less than the cost of a Uber ride, which is $22. So the Lyft ride costs $22 - $4 = $18. 

Next, we must find the cost of a taxi ride, which is $3 less than the cost of a Lyft ride. So the taxi ride costs $18 - $3 = $15.

Now, we must find the total cost of the ride, which is the cost of the taxi plus the tip, which is $15 + (0.20 * $15) = $15 + $3 = $18.

Therefore, the total cost of the ride downtown is $18.

Let's start by defining the cost of the taxi ride as \( T \).

According to the problem, a Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride, so the Lyft cost is \( T + 4 \).

An Uber ride costs $3 more than a Lyft ride, so the Uber cost is \( (T + 4) + 3 = T + 7 \).

We know that the Uber ride costs $22, so we can set up the equation \( T + 7 = 22 \). Solving for \( T \):

\[ T + 7 = 22 \]
\[ T = 22 - 7 \]
\[ T = 15 \]

So the taxi ride costs $15.

Next, Trevor tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride. Since the original cost of the taxi ride is $15, the tip is \( 0.20 \times 15 = 3 \) dollars.

The total cost of the taxi ride plus the tip is \( 15 + 3 = 18 \) dollars.

To find the total cost of the taxi ride downtown with a 20% tip, we first need to determine the cost of the taxi ride itself. We know:

- A Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride => Lyft $4 more
- An Uber ride costs $3 more than a Lyft ride => $22 cost for Ubers
- Therefore, a Lyft ride costs $22 - $3 = $19
- The cost of a taxi ride is twice the cost of a Lyft ride => $19 * 2 = $38 taxi ride

The tip is 20% of the original cost of the taxi ride. So we calculate the tip amount:

\[ \text{Tip} = 0.2 \times \text{Taxi Ride Cost} \]

Now we can find the total cost of the ride downtown including the tip.

Next, we calculate the total taxi ride cost including the tip:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Taxi Ride Cost} + \text{Tip} \]

38 + (0.2 * 38) = 38 + 7.6 = 45.6

To find the total cost of Trevor's ride downtown, we first need to determine the cost of each type of ride:

1. **Cost of a Lyft ride**: Let \( L \) represent the cost of a Lyft ride.
2. **Cost of a taxi ride**: Let \( T \) represent the cost of a taxi ride.
3. **Cost of an Uber ride**: Let \( U \) represent the cost of an Uber ride.

From the information given:

- The Uber ride costs $22, so \( U = 22 \).
- The Uber ride costs $3 more than a Lyft ride, so \( U = L + 3 \).
- The Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride, so \( L = T + 4 \).

We can use these equations to find the values of \( L \) and \( T \):

1. \( 22 = L + 3 \)
   \[
   L = 22 - 3 = 19
   \]
   
2. \( 19 = T + 4 \)
   \[
   T = 19 - 4 = 15
   \]

Now we know the costs:
- Lyft ride (\( L \)) = $19
- Taxi ride (\( T \)) = $15

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ride:
\[
\text{Total cost without tip} = T + L = 15 + 19 = 34
\]

Then, Trevor tips the taxi driver 20% of this amount:
\[
\text{Tip} = 0.20 \times 34 = 6.8
\]

Finally, we add the tip to the total cost to find the overall amount:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 34 + 6.8 = 40.8
\]

So, the total cost of the ride downtown, including the tip, is $40.80.

Let's denote the cost of a taxi ride as \( T \).

First, let's determine the cost of a Lyft ride. According to the information, a Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride. So, if the cost of a Lyft ride is \( L \), we can express this as:
\[ L = T + 4 \]

Next, let's find the cost of an Uber ride. The problem states that an Uber ride costs $3 more than a Lyft ride. So, the cost of an Uber ride \( U \) is:
\[ U = L + 3 \]
Given that the Uber ride costs $22, we can substitute \( L \) from the previous equation:
\[ 22 = L + 3 \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = 22 - 3 = 19 \]
So, the cost of a Lyft ride is $19.

Now, we can find the cost of a taxi ride:
\[ T = L - 4 = 19 - 4 = 15 \]

Trevor takes a taxi ride, so the cost of the taxi ride is $15. He tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride. The original cost of the taxi ride is $15, so the tip is:
\[ 0.20 \times 15 = 3 \]

The total cost of the taxi ride including the tip is:
\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the ride downtown is $18.

Let's denote the costs of the taxi ride, Lyft ride, and Uber ride as \( C \), \( L \), and \( U \) respectively. According to the problem:

1. The Uber ride costs $22, so \( U = 22 \).
2. The Uber ride costs $3 more than a Lyft ride, so \( U = L + 3 \). Substituting the value of \( U \), we get \( 22 = L + 3 \). So, \( L = 22 - 3 = 19 \).
3. The Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride, so \( L = C + 4 \). Substituting the value of \( L \), we get \( 19 = C + 4 \). So, \( C = 19 - 4 = 15 \).

The taxi ride costs $15.

Trevor tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride. The original cost of the ride is $15, so the tip is \( 0.20 \times 15 = 3 \) dollars.

To calculate the original cost of the taxi ride, we need to work backwards based on the given information.

1. **Calculate the cost of the Lyft ride**: 
   - We know the Uber ride costs $22, which is $3 more than the Lyft ride. Therefore, the cost of the Lyft ride can be found by subtracting $3 from the Uber ride cost.
   - Lyft ride cost = Uber ride cost - $3
   - Lyft ride cost = $22 - $3 = $19

2. **Calculate the cost of the taxi ride**: 
   - We know the Lyft ride costs $19, which is $4 more than the taxi ride.
   - Taxi ride cost = Lyft ride cost - $4
   - Taxi ride cost = $19 - $4 = $15

3. **Calculate the tip amount**: 
   - Trevor tips the taxi driver 20% of the original taxi ride cost.
   - Tip amount = 20% of $15
   - Tip amount = 0.20 * $15 = $3

4. **Calculate the total cost of the taxi ride**: 
   - The total cost is the sum of the original taxi ride cost and the tip amount.
   - Total cost = Taxi ride cost + Tip amount
   - Total cost = $15 + $3 = $18

The total cost of the taxi ride downtown is $18.
