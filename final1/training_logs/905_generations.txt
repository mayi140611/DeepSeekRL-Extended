<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = D - 0.2D = 0.8D \]

The problem also states that the number of frogs is twice the number of dogs. We are given that there are 160 frogs, so:
\[ \text{Number of dogs} = \frac{\text{Number of frogs}}{2} = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

Now that we know \( D = 80 \), we can find the number of cats. Since the number of cats is 0.8 times the number of dogs:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 0.8 \times 80 = 64 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the compound by adding the number of dogs, cats, and frogs together:
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of frogs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 80 + 64 + 160 = 304 \]

Let's denote the number of dogs in the compound as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many frogs as dogs. Therefore, the number of frogs \( F \) can be expressed as:
\[
F = 2D
\]

We are given that there are 160 frogs, so:
\[
2D = 160 \implies D = \frac{160}{2} = 80
\]

The number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats \( C \) can be expressed as:
\[
C = D - 0.2D = 0.8D
\]

Substituting \( D = 80 \) into the equation:
\[
C = 0.8 \times 80 = 64
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in the compound:
\[
\text{Total number of animals} = C + D + F = 64 + 80 + 160 = 204
\]

Let's denote the number of dogs by \( D \). According to the problem, the number of frogs is twice the number of dogs, so we can write:
\[ \text{Number of frogs} = 2D \]
We are given that the number of frogs is 160:
\[ 2D = 160 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

Now, the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs. Let \( C \) be the number of cats. We can express this relationship as:
\[ C = 0.8D \]
Substituting \( D = 80 \) into the equation:
\[ C = 0.8 \times 80 = 64 \]

Now, we know the number of each type of animal:
- Dogs: \( D = 80 \)
- Cats: \( C = 64 \)
- Frogs: \( 160 \)

The total number of animals in the compound is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and frogs:
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = D + C + \text{Frogs} = 80 + 64 + 160 = 204 \]

Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \). According to the problem, there are 160 frogs, and the number of frogs is twice the number of dogs. So, we have:
\[ 2D = 160 \]
From this equation, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The number of dogs is 80, and there are 20% fewer cats than dogs. Therefore, the number of cats \( C \) can be calculated as:
\[ C = D - 0.2D = 0.8D \]
Substituting \( D \) with 80, we get:
\[ C = 0.8 \times 80 = 64 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of animals in the compound, which is the sum of dogs, cats, and frogs:
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = D + C + \text{number of frogs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 80 + 64 + 160 = 304 \]

Thus, the total number of animals in the compound is \( 304 \).

Let's denote the number of dogs by \( D \).
The number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs, so the number of cats is \( 0.8D \).
The number of frogs is twice the number of dogs, so the number of dogs is \( \frac{F}{2} \), where \( F = 160 \) is the number of frogs.
We already know that \( D = \frac{F}{2} = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \).
So the number of cats in the compound is \( 0.8 \times 80 = 64 \).
The total number of animals in the compound is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and frogs, so it is \( 80 + 64 + 160 = 304 \).

Now, using the number of dogs, we can find the number of cats:

Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of frogs is twice the number of dogs. Therefore, we can write:

We are given that there are 160 frogs:
\[ 2D = 160 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

So, there are 80 dogs.

Next, the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs. Let \( C \) represent the number of cats. Then:
\[ C = 80 - 0.2 \times 80 \]
\[ C = 80 - 16 \]
\[ C = 64 \]

So, there are 64 cats.

Now we need to find the total number of animals in the compound. The total number \( T \) includes all types of animals:
\[ T = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of frogs} \]
\[ T = 64 + 80 + 160 \]

Let's denote the number of dogs in the compound as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many frogs as dogs, so the number of frogs is \( 2D \).

We are given that there are 160 frogs, so:
\[ 2D = 160 \]
\[ D = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]
So, there are 80 dogs in the compound.

The number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs. To find the number of cats, we can calculate 20% of the number of dogs and subtract it from the number of dogs:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = D - 0.20D = 0.80D \]
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in the compound by adding the number of dogs, cats, and frogs:
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = D + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of frogs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 80 + 64 + 160 \]
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 304 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals present in the compound is 304.

Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \), the number of cats as \( C \), and the number of frogs as \( F \).

According to the problem:
1. The number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs:
\[ C = D - 0.2D = 0.8D \]

2. There are twice as many frogs as the number of dogs:
\[ F = 2D \]

We are given that:
\[ F = 160 \]
So we can solve for \( D \) from this:
\[ 2D = 160 \]
\[ D = 160 / 2 \]
\[ D = 80 \]

Now we can find \( C \) using the value of \( D \):
\[ C = 0.8D \]
\[ C = 0.8 \times 80 \]
\[ C = 64 \]

Finally, we add the number of dogs, cats, and frogs to get the total number of animals:

\[ \text{Total} = 160 + 64 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 304 \]

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs in the compound.
2. The number of frogs is twice the number of dogs: \( F = 2D \).
3. Given that there are 160 frogs, we set up the equation: 
   \[
   160 = 2D
   \]
4. Solving for \( D \), we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   D = \frac{160}{2} = 80

   So, there are 80 dogs in the compound.

5. The number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs. We calculate the number of cats as:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = D - 0.2D = 0.8D
   \]
6. Substituting the number of dogs \( D = 80 \):
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 0.8 \times 80 = 64
   \]
   Therefore, there are 64 cats in the compound.

7. The total number of animals in the compound is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and frogs:
   \[
   \text{Total number of animals} = D + F + \text{Number of cats} = 80 + 160 + 64
