1. First, calculate the total number of invited friends: Michonne invites 6 friends from school and 12 friends from her neighborhood, so that's 6 + 12 = 18 friends.
2. Each of these 18 friends can bring two additional friends. So, the total number of additional friends that can be invited is 18 * 2 = 36.
3. Now, the total number of people going to Michonne's birthday party will be the sum of the invited friends and the additional friends, which is 18 + 36 = 54.

To determine the total number of people attending Michonne's birthday party, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of friends Michonne invites:**
   - Michonne invites 6 friends from school.
   - Michonne invites 12 friends from her neighborhood.

   Total friends invited = 6 (school) + 12 (neighborhood) = 18 friends.

2. **Determine the number of additional friends each invited friend brings:**
   - Each of Michonne's 18 friends can bring 2 additional friends.

   Number of additional friends = 18 friends * 2 friends/friend = 36 friends.

3. **Calculate the total number of people attending the party:**
   - The initial 18 friends + the 36 additional friends.

   Total people = 18 (initial friends) + 36 (additional friends) = 54 people.

Therefore, the total number of people attending Michonne's birthday party is 54.

Since Michonne is invited 6 of her school friends and 12 of her neighborhood friends, the first group will bring 6 * 2 = 12 friends. The second group will bring 12 * 2 = 24 friends. The total number of people in attendance will be Michonne and her friends plus the friends of friends, which is a total of Michonne + 6 + 12 + 12 + 24 = 54 people.

Michonne invites 6 friends from school and 12 friends from her neighborhood, for a total of 6 + 12 = 18 invited guests.

Each of these 18 friends can bring 2 more friends along. So for each friend, 2 additional guests will join the party. So 18 friends * 2 guests = 36 total additional guests.

Adding the invited guests and the additional guests, Michonne’s birthday party will have 18 + 36 = 54 people.

Therefore, the answer is 54.

First, we need to calculate the total number of friends Michonne invites. She invites 6 friends from school and 12 friends from her neighborhood, which gives us a total of \(6 + 12 = 18\) friends.

Next, each of these 18 friends can bring along 2 additional friends. Therefore, the number of additional friends brought by these 18 friends is \(18 \times 2 = 36\).

To find the total number of people going to Michonne's birthday party, we add the original number of invitations to the number of additional friends brought along. This gives us \(18 + 36 = 54\).

So, 54 people are coming to Michonne's birthday party.

First, let's calculate the number of friends Michonne is inviting:
- From school: 6 friends
- From the neighborhood: 12 friends

Total friends Michonne is inviting = 6 + 12 = 18 friends

Each of these friends asks if they can bring two friends along. So, for each of the 18 friends, there will be:
- 18 friends × 2 additional friends = 36 additional friends

Now, let's add the original invitees to the additional invitees:
- Original invites: 18 friends
- Additional invitees: 36 friends

Total people going to the party = 18 + 36 = 54 people

Now, let's figure out how many people from school and neighborhood will come along with Michonne:
- From school: 6 original friends
- From the neighborhood: 12 original friends

Total from school and neighborhood = 6 + 12 = 18 people

We also have to include Michonne herself, who is also going to the party:
- Including Michonne = 54 + 18 = 72 people

So, the total number of people going to the party is 72.

First, let's determine the total number of friends Michonne initially invited:
\[ 6 (\text{school friends}) + 12 (\text{neighborhood friends}) = 18 \text{ friends} \]

Each invited friend is allowed to bring two additional friends. Therefore, each of the 18 friends will bring:
\[ 2 \text{ additional friends} \]

Since there are 18 friends, the total number of additional friends (including the initial friends) will be:
\[ 18 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ additional friends each} = 36 \text{ additional friends} \]

Now let's add the initial friends to the additional friends to get the total number of attendees:
\[ 18 \text{ initial friends} + 36 \text{ additional friends} = 54 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people attending Michonne's birthday party will be:
\[ 54 \text{ people} \]

First, let's calculate the total number of friends Michonne has invited. She invited 6 school friends and 12 neighborhood friends, so the total number of friends she invited is 6 + 12 = 18.

Each of these 18 friends is asking to bring two friends along as well. So, the total number of additional people brought by these friends is 18 * 2 = 36.

Now, to find the total number of people attending the party, we add Michonne's invited friends and the invited friends' friends that each is bringing along:

18 (Michonne's friends) + 36 (friends of Michonne's friends) = 54.

Therefore, there are 54 people going to Michonne's birthday party.

First, calculate the total number of friends Michonne directly invited:
\[ 6 \text{ (school friends)} + 12 \text{ (neighborhood friends)} = 18 \text{ friends} \]

Each of these 18 friends asks if they can bring 2 additional friends, so the total number of additional friends is:
\[ 18 \text{ friends} \times 2 = 36 \text{ additional friends} \]

Now, add the direct friends to the additional friends:
\[ 18 \text{ direct friends} + 36 \text{ additional friends} = 54 \text{ people} \]

Additionally, Michonne herself will also be attending the party, so we need to add her to the total:

1. First, Michonne invites 6 friends from school and 12 friends from her neighborhood. So, the total number of friends Michonne invites initially is 6 + 12 = 18.

2. Each of these friends can bring 2 additional friends. So, if there are 18 friends, including Michonne, each inviting 2 additional friends, we need to calculate the total number of additional friends.

   18 friends * 2 additional friends per friend = 36 additional friends.

3. Adding these additional friends to the initial 18 friends gives us a total of 18 + 36 = 54 people going to the party.

4. However, the question does not ask for the total number of people including Michonne. It just asks for how many people are going to Michonne’s birthday party, which includes the initial 18 friends plus the 36 additional friends brought by the original guests.

Therefore, the total number of people going to Michonne’s birthday party is 18 friends + 36 additional friends = 54 people.

To find out how many people will attend Michonne's birthday party, we need to account for the initial guests and their accompanying friends.

Initially, Michonne invites 6 friends from school and 12 friends from her neighborhood, making a total of 6 + 12 = 18 initial guests.

Each of these 18 friends asks to bring 2 friends each, so we multiply 18 by 2 to find out the additional number of guests:
18 friends * 2 friends per friend = 36 additional guests.

Adding the initial guests and the additional guests together, we get:
18 initial guests + 36 additional friends = 54 people in total.

So, there will be 54 people attending the party.
