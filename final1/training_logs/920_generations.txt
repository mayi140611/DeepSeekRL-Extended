To find out how long it will take to complete the entire set of laundry, we need to consider both the wash cycle and the dry cycle for each load.

1. For each load of laundry:
    - Washing takes 45 minutes
    - Drying takes 1 hour

So, for each load of laundry, it takes a total of:
  45 minutes + 60 minutes = 105 minutes

2. With 8 loads of laundry, the total time required would be:
  8 loads * 105 minutes/load = 840 minutes

We need to convert minutes to hours:
  840 minutes รท 60 minutes/hour = 14 hours

Therefore, the entire set of laundry will take 14 hours to complete.

To determine the total time required to wash and dry all 8 loads of laundry, we need to calculate the time for the wash cycles and the dry cycles separately, then sum them up.

Each load takes 45 minutes in the wash cycle and 1 hour in the dry cycle. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes.

First, calculate the total time for the wash cycles:
- Time for one load = 45 minutes
- Number of loads = 8
\[ \text{Total wash time} = 45 \text{ minutes/load} \times 8 \text{ loads} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the total time for the dry cycles:
- Time for one load = 60 minutes
- Number of loads = 8
\[ \text{Total dry time} = 60 \text{ minutes/load} \times 8 \text{ loads} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, sum the total wash and dry times to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 360 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} = 840 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{840 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time required to complete the entire set of laundry is 14 hours.

To find the total time it will take to complete the entire set of laundry, you need to add the time taken for each cycle in both the wash and dry cycles.

For each load, it takes 45 minutes for the wash cycle and 60 minutes (1 hour) for the dry cycle. Since there are 8 loads of laundry, the total time for the wash cycles would be \(8 \times 45\) minutes. The total time for the dry cycles would be \(8 \times 60\) minutes.

Now, combining these times will give you the total time in minutes. Finally, to convert the total time into hours, you will divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

\( \text{Total time in minutes} = (8 \times 45) + (8 \times 60) \)

\( \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{(8 \times 45) + (8 \times 60)}{60} \)

First, we need to calculate the total time required for one complete set of laundry, which includes both the wash and dry cycles. 

1. The wash cycle takes 45 minutes, 
2. And the dry cycle takes 1 hour (which is 60 minutes).

Total time in minutes = 45 minutes + 60 minutes = 105 minutes

Next, we convert the total time to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

Total time in hours = 105 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1.75 hours

So, it will take 1.75 hours to complete the entire set of laundry.

To find out how long it will take to complete the entire set of laundry, we need to calculate the total time spent on washing and drying each load, and then multiply by the number of loads.

For washing one load of laundry, it takes 45 minutes.
For drying one load of laundry, it takes 1 hour, which is equal to 60 minutes.

Total time to wash one load of laundry: 45 minutes
Total time to dry one load of laundry: 60 minutes

Now, we calculate the total time for washing all 8 loads:
8 loads * 45 minutes/load = 360 minutes

Then calculate the total time for drying all 8 loads:
8 loads * 60 minutes/load = 480 minutes

Now we add the time for washing and drying:
360 minutes (washing) + 480 minutes (drying) = 840 minutes

To convert the total time to hours:
840 minutes รท 60 minutes/hour = 14 hours

Therefore, the total time required to complete the laundry is 14 hours.

To find the total time it takes to complete the laundry, we first need to calculate the time taken for one complete cycle (wash + dry) for all 8 loads of laundry.

Each load requires:
- 45 minutes for the wash cycle
- 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) for the dry cycle

Adding these times together:
\( 45 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 105 \text{ minutes} \)

For 8 loads of laundry, the total time is:
\( 105 \text{ minutes} \times 8 = 840 \text{ minutes} \)

To convert minutes to hours:
\( \frac{840 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 14 \text{ hours} \)

So, it will take 14 hours to complete the entire set of laundry.

To determine the total time required to wash and dry all 8 loads of laundry, we need to calculate the time for each cycle separately and then convert the total time into hours.

1. **Wash cycle**: Each load of laundry takes 45 minutes in the wash cycle.
2. **Dry cycle**: Each load of laundry takes 1 hour in the dry cycle, which is equivalent to 60 minutes.

Since there are 8 loads of laundry for each cycle:
1. **Total time for the wash cycle**: \(8 \text{ loads} \times 45 \text{ minutes/load} = 360 \text{ minutes}\).
2. **Total time for the dry cycle**: \(8 \text{ loads} \times 60 \text{ minutes/load} = 480 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we convert the total time for both cycles into hours:
1. **Total time for the wash cycle in hours**: \(360 \text{ minutes} \div 60\text{ minutes/hour} = 6 \text{ hours}\).
2. **Total time for the dry cycle in hours**: \(480 \text{ minutes} \div 60\text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours}\).

Finally, we add the total time for both cycles:
\( 6 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 14 \text{ hours} \).

So, it will take 14 hours to complete the entire set of laundry.

Each load of laundry includes a wash cycle of 45 minutes and a dry cycle of 1 hour. The combined duration for one load is 45 minutes + 60 minutes = 105 minutes. Since there are 8 loads, the total time in minutes required is 8 * 105 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore:

Total time in hours = $\frac{8 * 105}{60}$

To find out the total time it will take to complete the entire set of laundry, we need to add the time it takes for each wash cycle and each dry cycle together.

First, let's calculate the total time for the wash cycles:
Each load of laundry takes 45 minutes, and there are 8 loads.
\[ 8 \text{ loads} \times 45 \text{ minutes/load} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the dry cycles:
Each load of laundry takes 1 hour in the dry cycle, and there are 8 loads.
\[ 8 \text{ loads} \times 1 \text{ hour/load} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, add the time for the wash cycles and the dry cycles together:
\[ 360 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ hours} = 468 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ 468 \text{ minutes} รท 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 7.8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take to complete the entire set of laundry is 7.8 hours.

First, let's calculate the total time it takes for one load of laundry to complete. The wash cycle takes 45 minutes, and the dry cycle takes 1 hour. Since 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes, we can convert the dry cycle time into minutes by multiplying 60 by the number of minutes in an hour, which gives us 60 minutes.

Next, we add up the times for the wash and dry cycles of one load: 45 minutes for the wash and 60 minutes for the dry, totaling 105 minutes.

Since there are 8 loads of laundry, we multiply the time for one load by 8. So, 105 minutes per load times 8 loads equals 840 minutes.
