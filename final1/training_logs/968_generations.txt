<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the amount of credit sales, which is 2/5 of the total sales. 

2/5 of $80 is calculated by multiplying $80 by 2/5:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{2 \times 80}{5} = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

So, Mr. Brandon got $32 in credit sales.

The rest of the sales are cash sales, which are the total sales minus the credit sales:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Therefore, Mr. Brandon got $48 from cash sales.

To find out how much Mr. Brandon got from cash sales, we first need to determine the total sales amount. We know that the total sales amount is $80, and 2/5 of this total sales consists of credit sales. This means the rest, which is 3/5, are cash sales. 

First, calculate the amount of credit sales:
\[ \text{Credit Sales} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 \]
\[ \text{Credit Sales} = 32 \]

Next, calculate the amount of cash sales:
\[ \text{Cash Sales} = 80 - 32 \]
\[ \text{Cash Sales} = 48 \]

Therefore, Mr. Brandon got $48 from cash sales.

To find out how much Mr. Brandon received from cash sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how much Mr. Brandon made from credit sales. We know that 2/5 of the total sales were credit sales. So, we calculate 2/5 of $80.

\[ \text{Credit sales} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = $32 \]

2. The rest of the sales were cash sales, so to find how much this was, we subtract the credit sales from the total sales:

\[ \text{Cash sales} = \text{Total sales} - \text{Credit sales} = $80 - $32 = $48 \]

So, Mr. Brandon received $48 from cash sales.

Let's denote the total sales amount by \( S \). According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5}S = 80 \). From this, we can solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{80}{\frac{2}{5}} = 80 \times \frac{5}{2} = 200
\]

The sales amount \( S \) is $200. Since Mr. Brandon received credit sales of \( \frac{2}{5} \), the amount from credit sales is:

\[
\text{Credit Sales} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

The rest of the sales, which are the cash sales, is:

\[
\text{Cash Sales} = S - \text{Credit Sales} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

So, Mr. Brandon received $120 from cash sales.

To determine how much Mr. Brandon received from cash sales, we first need to calculate the total sales without considering the credit and cash sales ratios.

Given that the total sales amount to $80 and that 2/5 of the sales were credit sales, the credit sales amount is:
\[ \text{Credit sales} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Subtracting the credit sales from the total sales gives the amount of cash sales:
\[ \text{Cash sales} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

To determine how much Mr. Brandon got from cash sales, we start by understanding the given information. We know the total sales amount is $80, and 2/5 of these sales were credit sales. Therefore, the remaining amount must be cash sales.

First, calculate the total amount of credit sales:
\[
\text{Credit sales} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]
Now, subtract the credit sales from the total sales to find the cash sales amount:

Let's denote the total sales Mr. Brandon made yesterday as \( S \).

From the problem, it's given that 2/5 of the total amount of sales were credit sales, which means 3/5 of the total sales were cash sales.

The total amount Mr. Brandon received from sales is equal to the total amount he had with him, plus the sales made.

So, the cash sales can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Cash Sales} = S - \left(\frac{2}{5}S\right) \]

We know from the problem statement that:
\[ \frac{2}{5}S = $80 \]

Now, substituting this into the equation for cash sales:
\[ \text{Cash Sales} = S - 80 \]

And since we know that:
\[ \frac{2}{5}S = $80 \]

Then:
\[ S = \frac{5}{2} \times 80 \]
\[ S = 200 \]

Now substituting this value back into the equation:
\[ \text{Cash Sales} = S - 80 \]
\[ \text{Cash Sales} = 200 - 80 \]
\[ \text{Cash Sales} = 120 \]

So, Mr. Brandon got $120 from cash sales.

To determine the amount Mr. Brandon received from cash sales, we first need to find the total sales amount excluding credit sales. Given that 2/5 of the total sales were credit sales, the remaining 3/5 must have been cash sales. 

Let's represent the total sales as $S$. According to the problem, 2/5 of $S$ equals the value of credit sales which is $80. Thus, we can write:

\[ \frac{2}{5}S = 80 \]

To find the total sales amount $S$, we solve for $S$ in the equation above:

\[ S = \frac{80 \times 5}{2} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \]

So, the total sales amount is $100.

Next, we need to find out how much of the total sales were cash sales. Since 3/5 of the sales were cash sales, we calculate this as:

\[ \text{Cash sales} = \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60 \]

Thus, Mr. Brandon received $60 from cash sales.

To find out how much Mr. Brandon got from cash sales, we first need to determine the total amount of cash sales made. Since we know that 2/5 of the total sales were credit sales, that means 3/5 of the total sales were made in cash.

Let's call the total sales amount "S" and the amount of cash sales "C". We know that:
\[ \frac{2}{5}S = \text{Credit Sales} \]
\[ \frac{3}{5}S = \text{Cash Sales} \]

We also know that the total sales amount was $80, so:
\[ S = 80 \]

Since the cash sales are 3/5 of the total sales, we can calculate the cash sales amount as:
\[ C = \frac{3}{5} \times S \]
\[ C = \frac{3}{5} \times 80 \]
\[ C = 48 \]

So, Mr. Brandon got $48 from cash sales.

1. First, we need to determine the total sales Mr. Brandon made yesterday. According to the given information, the buyers who came to Mr. Brandon's shop yesterday bought goods worth $80. This amount is a part of the total sales, which is the 2/5 of the total sales.

2. To find out the total amount, multiply the sales from purchases (which is $80) by the fraction of sales that were credit sales:
   $$\frac{2}{5} \times \$80 = \$32$$

3. The total amount is $32, which is 2/5 of the total sales. Therefore, we need to find the total sales amount that equals this $32 if the purchases value was 2/5 of the total.

4. Solving for the total sales (let's call it $x$):
   $$\frac{2}{5}x = \$32$$
   $$x = \$32 \times \frac{5}{2} = \$80$$

So, the total sales amount is $80.

5. The amount from cash sales can be calculated by subtracting the credit sales ($32) from the total sales ($80):
   $$\$80 - \$32 = \$48$$

Therefore, the amount Mr. Brandon got from cash sales is $48.

Let's denote the total sales made by Mr. Brandon yesterday as \( S \).

According to the information given, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total sales were credit sales, which amounts to \( \frac{2}{5} \times S = 80 \) dollars.

To find the total sales \( S \), we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times S = 80 \]
\[ S = \frac{80 \times 5}{2} \]
\[ S = 200 \]

So, the total sales made by Mr. Brandon yesterday were $200.

The rest of the sales were cash sales, which amounts to \( S - \frac{2}{5} \times S = 200 - 80 = 120 \) dollars.

Therefore, Mr. Brandon got $120 from cash sales.

Let's denote the total amount of sales Mr. Brandon made yesterday as \( S \). According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total sales were credit sales, which means \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total sales were cash sales.

Since the total sales amounted to $80, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{3}{5} S = \$80 \]

To find the total sales \( S \), we need to solve for \( S \). Multiplying both sides of the equation by 5 gives us:
\[ 3S = 80 \times 5 \]

Then we divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{80 \times 5}{3} \]

Calculating the right side of the equation gives:
\[ S = \$133.\overline{33} \]

Since this is the total sales, we now need to determine the amount from the cash sales, which is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total sales. This can be calculated by:
\[ \text{Cash Sales} = \frac{3}{5} \times 133.\overline{33} \]

Simplifying gives us:
\[ \text{Cash Sales} = \$79.99 \]

So the amount Mr. Brandon got from cash sales is approximately $79.99.

1. First, determine the amount of credit sales. According to the information, 2/5 of the total sales amount is credit sales. So, we calculate this as:
   \[
   \text{Credit Sales} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
   \]

2. Next, we know the total sales were $80. To find the cash sales, we subtract the credit sales from the total sales:
   \[
   \text{Cash Sales} = \text{Total Sales} - \text{Credit Sales} = 80 - 32 = 48
   \]

3. Thus, $48 of Mr. Brandon's sales came from cash sales.

However, it's possible the question was interpreted to mean the amount from cash payments (which don't involve credit), so a better interpretation might be the cash sales of credit cards or other payment methods which didn't involve credit. If that's the case:

4. If we assume that $32 (the credit sales figure) is credit card sales and $48 is cash sales, we have our answer.

Therefore, the amount Mr. Brandon got from cash sales is $32.

However, if the question actually asked for cash sales without considering credit sales, then our previous calculation for cash sales is $48.

The correct interpretation depends on the question's wording.
