system
Bran's tuition fee is $90.
His part-time job pays him $15 per month.
His scholarship covers 30% of his tuition fee, which is 0.3 * $90 = $27.
Bran needs to pay $90 - $27 = $63 within 3 months.
Since he has a job that pays $15 per month, he can earn $15 * 3 = $45 in 3 months.
Therefore, Bran still needs to pay $63 - $45 = $18.

Bran's tuition fee is $90. With a scholarship that covers 30% of his tuition fee, the scholarship covers $90 \times 0.30 = $27. The remaining tuition fee to be paid is $90 - $27 = $63. Since he is paying within 3 months, he will earn $15 per month from his part-time job. Over 3 months, he will earn $15 \times 3 = $45. Therefore, the amount he still needs to pay is $63 - $45 = $18.

First, calculate the amount covered by the scholarship: $90 x 0.30 = $27.

Then calculate the amount Bran has to pay directly from his part-time job: $90 - $27 = $63.

Now, calculate the total amount Bran has to pay over 3 months, considering his part-time job earnings: $63 / 3 = $21 per month.

So, the total amount Bran still needs to pay within 3 months is: $21.

Bran's scholarship covers 30% of his tuition fee, which is (30/100) * $90 = $27. This means his tuition fee is $90 - $27 = $63. Bran earns $15 per month from his part-time job, so in 3 months, he will earn $15 * 3 = $45. After his earnings and the scholarship, he will need to pay him $63 - $45 = $18 to pay his tuition fee within 3 months.

First, calculate the scholarship amount:
\[ \text{Scholarship} = 0.30 \times 90 = 27 \]

Next, calculate the total income from the part-time job:
\[ \text{Income} = 15 \times 3 = 45 \]

Now, calculate the total amount of money Bran has, including the scholarship:
\[ \text{Total Money} = 27 + 45 = 72 \]

Finally, calculate how much he still needs to pay:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 90 - 72 = 18 \]

First, we calculate how much Bran's scholarship covers:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$90 = 0.30 \times 90 = \$27 \]

Next, we determine how much Bran earns from his part-time job in 3 months:
\[ \$15 \text{ per month} \times 3 \text{ months} = \$45 \]

Then, we subtract the scholarship amount and the amount earned from his part-time job from his total tuition fee to find out how much he still needs to pay:
\[ \$90 - \$27 - \$45 = \$18 \]

So, Bran still needs to pay \$18.

Bran's scholarship covers 30% of his tuition fee, so it covers $90 \times 0.30 = $27.
His part-time job pays him $15 per month, so in 3 months, he will get a total of $15 \times 3 = $45.

Bran's total tuition fee is $90. With the scholarship covering 30%, he gets a discount of $90 * 0.30 = $27. So, his tuition fee after the scholarship is $90 - $27 = $63. He needs to pay his tuition fee within 3 months. Thus, he needs to work for $63 / 3 = $21 a month. Since he earns $15 at the part-time job every month, his monthly shortfall is $21 - $15 = $6.

Bran's scholarship covers 30% of his $90 tuition fee, which is \(90 \times 0.30 = $27\). So, after his scholarship, the remaining tuition fee that he needs to pay is \(90 - 27 = $63\). Since he has a part-time job that pays him $15 per month, he will have \(15 \times 3 = $45\) in total from his job in 3 months. Therefore, the amount Bran still needs to pay is \(63 - 45 = $18\).

Bran's scholarship covers 30% of his $90 tuition fee, which is \( 90 \times 0.30 = \$27 \). 

So, his tuition fee after scholarship is \( 90 - 27 = \$63 \).

He needs to pay this amount within 3 months, and he earns $15 per month from his part-time job.

In 3 months, he will earn \( 15 \times 3 = \$45 \).

Therefore, he will pay \( 63 + 45 = \$105 \) in total.

To find out how much he still needs to pay, we subtract the total amount he will pay from his total tuition fee.

Total amount to pay within 3 months = $105
Total tuition fee = $90

Bran still needs to pay \( 105 - 90 = \$15 \) to clear his tuition fee.
