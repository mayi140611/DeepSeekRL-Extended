To calculate the cost of the discounted subscription, we first need to determine the discount amount by multiplying the regular price by the discount rate. 

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Rate} \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$80 \times 45\% \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$80 \times 0.45 \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$36 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the discounted price.

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$80 - \$36 \]

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$44 \]

To calculate the discounted subscription cost, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. This can be calculated by multiplying the normal subscription cost by the discount percentage:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Normal Subscription Cost} \times \left( \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \right) \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$80 \times \left( \frac{45}{100} \right) \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$80 \times 0.45 \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$36 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the normal subscription cost to find the discounted subscription cost:

\[ \text{Discounted Subscription Cost} = \text{Normal Subscription Cost} - \text{Discount Amount} \]

\[ \text{Discounted Subscription Cost} = \$80 - \$36 \]

\[ \text{Discounted Subscription Cost} = \$44 \]

So, the discounted subscription costs $44.

To calculate the discounted cost, we first need to find 45% of the original price, which is $80. We can do this by multiplying 80 by 0.45 (since 100% - 45% = 55%, and 55% of the original price is our discount). 

80 * 0.45 = $36

The discounted subscription cost is $36.

To calculate the discounted price, we first find the amount of discount, which is 45% of $80. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = \text{Original price} - (\text{Original price} \times \text{Discount rate}) \]

\[ = $80 - ($80 \times 0.45) \]

\[ = $80 - $36 \]

\[ = $44 \]

Therefore, the discounted subscription cost is $44.

To find the discounted cost of the subscription, we first need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 45% of the original cost, so we can find the discount amount by multiplying $80 by 45%. 

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 80 \times \frac{45}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 80 \times 0.45 \]

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 36 \]

Now that we have the discount amount, we can calculate the discounted cost by subtracting the discount amount from the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost} = 80 - 36 \]

\[ \text{Discounted cost} = 44 \]

So, the discounted subscription costs $44.

To calculate the discounted cost of the subscription, we first need to find out how much the discount is. 

45% of $80 is calculated as follows: 
$$
45\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.45 \times 80 = 36
$$

Next, subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price:
$$
\text{Discounted price} = 80 - 36 = 44
$$

So, the discounted subscription cost is $44.

To find the discounted subscription cost, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount. The discount is 45% of the original price.

Original price: $80.00
Discount percentage: 45%

Discount amount = Original price * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $80.00 * 0.45
Discount amount = $36.00

To find the discounted price, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

Discounted price = Original price - Discount amount
Discounted price = $80.00 - $36.00
Discounted price = $44.00

The discounted subscription costs $44.00.
