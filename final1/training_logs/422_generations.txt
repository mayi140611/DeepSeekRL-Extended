system
To determine how much money Mom has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the initial amount she had. 

The cost of the bananas is \(2 \times €4 = €8\).
The cost of the pears is €2.
The cost of the asparagus is €6.
The cost of the chicken is €11.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[€8 + €2 + €6 + €11 = €27\]

Subtracting the total cost from the initial amount she had:
\[€55 - €27 = €28\]

So, Mom has €28 left.

To determine how much money Mom has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items she bought.
2. Subtract this total from the initial amount of €55.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items.
- Bananas: €4 each, 2 packs - €4 × 2 = €8
- Pears: €2
- Asparagus: €6
- Chicken: €11

Total cost = €8 + €2 + €6 + €11 = €27

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the initial amount.
€55 - €27 = €28

Therefore, Mom has €28 left.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on each item:

- 2 packs of bananas at €4 each: \(2 \times 4 = €8\)
- pears for €2: \(2\)
- asparagus for €6: \(6\)
- chicken for €11: \(11\)

Now, let's add up these amounts to find the total spent:

Total spent = €8 + €2 + €6 + €11 = €27

Mom initially had €55, so to find out how much she has left:

Money left = €55 - €27 = €28

1. First, we need to calculate the total amount Mom spent on bananas.
   She bought 2 packs of bananas for €4 each, so:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \, \text{€}
   \]

2. Next, add the cost of the pears, asparagus, and chicken:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pears} = 2 \, \text{€} 
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of asparagus} = 6 \, \text{€}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of chicken} = 11 \, \text{€}
   \]
   \[
   2 + 6 + 11 = 19 \, \text{€}
   \]

3. Now, add all the amounts spent together:
   \[
   8 \, \text{€ (bananas)} + 19 \, \text{€ (other items)} = 27 \, \text{€}
   \]

4. Finally, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Mom had:
   \[
   55 \, \text{€} - 27 \, \text{€} = 28 \, \text{€}
   \]

Answer: Mom has €28 left.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mom starts with €55.
2. She bought 2 packs of bananas for €4 each, which is 2 * €4 = €8.
3. She bought pears for €2.
4. She bought asparagus for €6.
5. She bought a chicken for €11.

Now let's sum up what she spent:
€8 (bananas) + €2 (pears) + €6 (asparagus) + €11 (chicken) = €27.

Finally, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount to find out how much money Mom has left:
€55 - €27 = €28.

Therefore, Mom has €28 left.

To find out how much money Mom has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract it from the amount she initially had.

First, the cost of the bananas:
2 packs of bananas × €4 per pack = €8

Next, the cost of the pears:
1 pear × €2 per pear = €2

Asparagus cost:
1 asparagus × €6 = €6

Finally, the cost of the chicken:
1 chicken × €11 = €11

Now, we add up the total cost of these items:
Cost of bananas + Cost of pears + Cost of asparagus + Cost of chicken
= €8 + €2 + €6 + €11 = €27

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount:
Initial amount - Total cost
= €55 - €27 = €28

So, Mom has €28 left.
