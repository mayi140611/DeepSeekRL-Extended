To calculate the total number of flights of stairs Janice walks in a single day, we need to calculate the flights of stairs she walks up and the flights of stairs she walks down separately, then sum them up.

She goes up the three flights of stairs 5 times, so that's:

5 flights/down * 3 floors/up = 15 flights of stairs

She goes down the three flights of stairs 3 times, so that's:

3 flights/down * 3 floors/up = 9 flights of stairs

Now we add the number of flights she walks up and the number of flights she walks down:

Total flights of stairs = 15 flights of stairs + 9 flights of stairs = 24 flights of stairs

Janice goes up stairs 5 times, and down stairs 3 times. 
$\text{flights of stairs} = \text{times} \times (\text{flights per trip} + 1)$
$\text{flights of stairs} = 5 \times (3 + 1) + 3 \times (3 + 1)$
$\text{flights of stairs} = 20 + 12$
$\text{flights of stairs} = \boxed{32}$

First find how many times Janice goes up the stairs: 5 trips - 3 trips = 2 trips
Then add that to the number of times she goes down the stairs to find her total number of trips: 2 trips + 3 trips = 5 trips
Then multiply the number of trips by the number of flights of stairs per trip to find how many flights of stairs she walks: 5 trips * 3 flights/trip = 15 flights of stairs

Janice uses the stairs 5 - 3 = 2 times a day.
On each trip the total number of flights of stairs she walks is 3 + 3 = 6.
So the total number of flights she walks in a single day is 2 * 6 = 12 flights.

In a single day, Janice goes up the three flights of stairs 5 times, which totals to \(3 \times 5 = 15\) flights of stairs. In the same day, she goes down the three flights of stairs 3 times, which totals to \(3 \times 3 = 9\) flights of stairs. Therefore, Janice walks a total of \(15 + 9 = 24\) flights of stairs in a single day.

Janice goes up the three flights of stairs 5 times and down 3 times in a single day, so she goes up the three flights of stairs 8 times.
She also uses the elevator the remainder of the time, which is 24-8=16 times.
On each trip to the third floor, she goes up 3 flights of stairs, so the total number of flights of stairs she goes up in a single day is 3*8=24.
On each trip down, she goes down 3 flights of stairs, so the total number of flights of stairs she go down in a single day is 3*3=9.
Therefore, the total number of flights of stairs she goes up and down in a single day is 24+9=33.

To find out how many flights of stairs Janice walks in a single day, we need to calculate the total number of times she goes up and down the stairs and then multiply by the number of flights of stairs per trip.

Janice goes up the stairs:
5 times (given)

Janice goes down the stairs:
3 times (given)

In total, she goes up and down the stairs:
5 + 3 = 8 times

Each trip involves 3 flights of stairs. Therefore, the total number of flights she walks in a single day is:
8 trips Ã— 3 flights per trip = 24 flights

To determine how many flights of stairs Janice walks in a single day, we need to calculate the total number of flights she walks up and the total number of flights she walks down, and then add these two numbers together.

First, we calculate the total number of flights of stairs Janice walks up in a single day:
- She walks up the stairs 5 times in a day.
- Each time she walks up, she walks 3 flights of stairs.

So, the total number of flights she walks up is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of flights of stairs Janice walks down in a single day:
- She walks down the stairs 3 times in a day.
- Each time she walks down, she walks 3 flights of stairs.

So, the total number of flights she walks down is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the number of flights she walks up and the number of flights she walks down to find the total number of flights of stairs she walks in a single day:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Therefore, the total number of flights of stairs Janice walks in a single day is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]

She walks down 3 flights of stairs 3 times per day, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 flights of stairs per day while going down.  Then, she uses the elevator the remainder of the time.  5 + 3 = 8 times per day. She uses the elevator 8 times per day to get to her office.  Since she walks 15 flights of stairs while going up and 9 flights of stairs while going down per day, the total number of flights of stairs that she walks per day is 15 + 9 = 24.
