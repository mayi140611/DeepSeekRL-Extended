To find the total cost, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of the piano is $500.
2. The cost of the lessons without discount is 20 lessons * $40/lesson = $800.
3. The discount on the lessons is 25%, so the discount amount is 25/100 * $800 = $200.
4. After applying the discount, the total cost of the lessons is $800 - $200 = $600.

Adding the cost of the piano and the discounted lesson cost:

$500 (piano) + $600 (lessons) = $1100.

So, the total cost is $1100.

To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses:

1. Purchase of the piano: $500
2. Cost of the lessons before discount: 20 lessons * $40/lesson = $800
3. Discount on the lessons: 25% of $800 = 0.25 * $800 = $200
4. Cost of lessons after discount: $800 - $200 = $600

Now, we sum these costs to find the total:
- Piano: $500
- Lessons after discount: $600

Total cost = $500 + $600 = $1100

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of lessons with the discount.

Discounted lesson cost = Original lesson cost * (1 - Discount percentage)
                      = $40 * (1 - 0.25)
                      = $40 * 0.75
                      = $30

Now, we can calculate the total cost:

Lessons cost = Number of lessons * Discounted lesson cost
            = 20 * $30
            = $600

Finally, we add the cost of the piano:

Total cost = Cost of piano + Lessons cost
          = $500 + $600
          = $1100

To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the lessons with the discount.

The original cost for 20 lessons at $40 per lesson is:
20 lessons * $40/lesson = $800

Now, with a 25% discount, the discounted cost for 20 lessons is:
25% of $800 = 0.25 * $800 = $200

The total cost for the lessons is the original cost minus the discount:
$800 - $200 = $600

Now, we add the cost of the piano to the discounted cost of the lessons to find the total cost:
$500 (piano) + $600 (lessons) = $1100

Therefore, everything cost $1100.

The cost of the piano is $500.
The cost of the lessons before the discount is $40 per lesson * 20 lessons = $800.
The discount is 25% of $800, which is 0.25 * $800 = $200.
So, the total cost of the lessons is $800 - $200 = $600.
Therefore, the total cost of everything is $500 + $600 = $1100.

To calculate the total cost, we first need to calculate the discounted price per lesson:

\( 40 \times 25\% = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \)

So, each lesson costs $30 after the discount. 

The total cost for 20 lessons is:

\( 20 \times 30 = 600 \)

Now, we add the cost of the piano:

Total = Cost of piano + Cost of lessons

\( 500 + 600 = 1100 \)

Everything costs $1100.

To find the total cost of everything, we need to calculate the cost of the piano and the discounted lessons.
The cost of the piano is $500.
The cost of one lesson without the discount is $40.
With a 25% discount, the cost of one lesson is $40 - ($40 * 0.25) = $30.
John has 20 lessons, so the total cost of lessons is 20 * $30 = $600.
The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the piano and the cost of the lessons, which is $500 + $600 = $1100.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the piano and the discounted lessons separately and then add them together.

Cost of the piano: $500
Lessons cost: $40 per lesson
Number of lessons: 20
Discount on lessons: 25%

First, let's calculate the discounted cost of the lessons:
20 lessons * $40 per lesson = $800
$800 * 25% discount = $800 * 0.25 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original cost:
$800 - $200 = $600

Finally, add the cost of the piano and the discounted lessons to get the total cost:
Cost of piano: $500
Cost of lessons after discount: $600
Total cost: $500 + $600 = $1100

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the lessons and add it to the cost of the piano.

First, let's calculate the discounted price per lesson. The lesson fee is $40, and there is a 25% discount. To find the discount amount per lesson, we calculate 25% of $40:

\[ \text{Discount per lesson} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discounted price per lesson is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the lessons. John gets 20 lessons, so:

\[ \text{Total lesson cost} = 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the piano, which is $500, to the total lesson cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of piano} + \text{Total lesson cost} = 500 + 600 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the total cost including the piano and lessons is $1100.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the piano, the cost of the lessons after the discount, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Cost of the piano**:
   The piano costs $500. This is the straightforward cost, so no additional calculation is needed here: $500.

2. **Cost of the lessons before the discount**:
   John hires a teacher for 20 lessons, at $40 per lesson. The total cost before the discount is:
   \[
   20 \text{ lessons} \times \$40 \text{ per lesson} = \$800
   \]

3. **Applying the 25% discount**:
   A 25% discount on $800 means he only pays 75% of the cost:
   \[
   \$800 \times 0.75 = \$600
   \]

4. **Total cost**:
   Adding the cost of the piano and the discounted cost of the lessons:
   \[
   \$500 + \$600 = \$1100
   \]

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the piano, the discounted cost of the lessons, and any other potential fees. 

The cost of the piano is $500.

For the lessons:
- The original cost per lesson is $40.
- With a 25% discount, the discounted cost per lesson is $40 * (1 - 0.25) = $40 * 0.75 = $30.
- Since John is getting 20 lessons, the total cost of the lessons is 20 * $30 = $600.

Total cost of everything = Cost of the piano + Total cost of the lessons
= $500 + $600
= $1100

To determine the total cost John incurred, we need to calculate the cost of the piano, the discounted cost of the lessons, and then sum these amounts.

1. The cost of the piano is $500.
2. The initial cost of the lessons before the discount is 20 lessons * $40 per lesson = $800.
3. John receives a 25% discount on the lessons. Therefore, he pays 75% of the original cost.
4. The cost of the discounted lessons is $800 * 0.75 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the piano to the discounted cost of the lessons:
- Cost of the piano: $500
- Cost of the discounted lessons: $600

Total cost = $500 + $600 = $1100.

The cost of the piano is $500.

The original cost for the lessons without the discount would be:
\[ 20 \text{ lessons} \times \$40 \text{ per lesson} = \$800 \]

With a 25% discount, the reduced cost for the lessons is:
\[ 20 \times \$40 \times (1 - 25\%) = \$800 \times 0.75 = \$600 \]

Now we add the cost of the piano and the discounted cost of the lessons to find the total cost:

The cost of the piano is $500. The regular cost of the lessons is $40 per lesson for 20 lessons, which is $40 * 20 = $800. With a 25% discount, the cost of the lessons becomes $800 * (1 - 0.25) = $600. The total cost of everything is the cost of the piano plus the discounted lesson cost, which is $500 + $600 = $1100.
