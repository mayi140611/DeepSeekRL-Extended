Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. There are 2 students in the restroom.
2. One less than three times the number of students in the restroom are absent. 
   - First, calculate three times the number of students in the restroom: \(3 \times 2 = 6\).
   - Subtract one from this number to find the number of students absent: \(6 - 1 = 5\).
   - Therefore, there are 5 students absent.

Now, we need to find the total number of students Carla teaches.

1. There are 2 students in the restroom and 5 students absent.
   - Therefore, there are \(2 + 5 = 7\) students who are out of the classroom.

3. There are four rows with six desks each that are 2/3 full.
   - First, calculate the total number of desks: \(4 \times 6 = 24\).
   - Since the rows are 2/3 full, the number of occupied desks is \(24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 24 \div 3 \times 2 = 8 \times 2 = 16\).
   - Therefore, there are 16 students in the classroom.

Now, we know the number of students Carla teaches, including those out of the classroom and those in the classroom.

Total number of students Carla teaches: \(16 + 7 = 23\).

<reasoning>
First, let's determine how many students are absent. We know that 2 students are in the restroom and one less than three times that number are absent. Since there are 2 students in the restroom, three times that is \(3 \times 2 = 6\). Therefore, one less than three times that number would be \(6 - 1 = 5\). So, 5 students are absent.

Next, let's figure out how many desks are occupied. There are four rows with six desks each, making a total of \(4 \times 6 = 24\) desks. Since the desks are \(2/3\) full, the number of students present is \(24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16\).

So, the number of students in the classroom is the number of students present plus the students in the restroom plus the number of absent students. That is \(16 + 2 + 5 = 23\).

Adding the students outside the classroom does not change the total number of students Carla teaches, because everyone is in the classroom. So, Carla teaches \(23 + 2 = 25\) students.

First, calculate the number of students in the restroom, which is 2.
Next, calculate the number of absent students. Since one less than three times the number in the restroom are absent, this is 3*2 - 1 = 5 absent students.
Now, first determine how many desks are in the classroom. There are 4 rows, each with 6 desks, totaling 24 desks. Since the desks are 2/3 full, this means there are 1/3 full.
Calculate the number of students in the room: 24 desks * 1/3 desks per student = 8 students.
Calculate the total number of students Carla is teaching by adding those in the restroom, those absent, and the number in the classroom: 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 students.

We know that there are 2 students in the restroom. According to Carla, one less than three times that number are absent. So, the number of absent students is \(3 \times 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\).

Each row has 6 desks and is 2/3 full, meaning there are \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) students in each row occupied. With 4 rows, there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) students in the classroom.

Now, we need to add the students in the classroom to those in the restroom to find the total number of students. There are \(4 + 5 = 9\) absent students. Therefore, the total number of students Carla teaches is \(16 + 9 = 25\).

First, we need to find out how many students are absent. We know that Carla knows that 2 students are in the restroom, and one less than three times that number of students are absent. So, if 2 students are in the restroom, then:

Absent students = 3 * 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5

Next, we need to calculate the number of students in the classroom. We know there are four rows with six desks each that are 2/3 full. So, in one row, there are:

Filled desks per row = 2/3 * 6 = 4

Since there are four rows, the total number of filled desks is:

Total filled desks = 4 * 4 = 16

Now, subtract the number of desks filled from the total number of desks to find out how many students are in the classroom:

Students in the classroom = Total desks - Filled desks = 24 - 16 = 8

Finally, add the number of students in the classroom, those in the restroom, and those absent to find the total number of students Carla teaches:

Total students = Students in the classroom + Students in the restroom + Absent students = 8 + 2 + 5 = 15

</reasoning>

Carla teaches a total of 15 students including those in and out of the classroom.

To determine the total number of students Carla teaches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of absent students.
2. Determine the number of students in the classrooms.
3. Add the students in the restroom, absent students, and students in the classrooms.

Step 1: Calculate the number of absent students.
The number of absent students is one less than three times the number of students in the restroom.
Number of students in the restroom = 2
Number of absent students = 3 * 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5

Step 2: Determine the number of students in the classrooms.
There are four rows with six desks each, making a total of 4 * 6 = 24 desks.
The classrooms are 2/3 full, so the number of students in the classrooms is:
24 * 2/3 = 16

Step 3: Add the students in the restroom, absent students, and students in the classrooms.
Total number of students = students in the restroom + absent students + students in the classrooms
Total number of students = 2 + 5 + 16 = 23

Therefore, Carla teaches a total of 23 students.

Next, we calculate the number of absent students, which is one less than three times the number of students in the restroom:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Now, we need to determine how many desks are occupied. There are four rows with six desks each, and each row is 2/3 full:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \]

The total number of students in the classroom, including those in the restroom and the ones taking attendance, is the sum of the students in the restroom, the absent students, the desks occupied, and the ones counting students:
\[ 2 + 5 + 16 = 23 \]

Finally, we add the students in the classroom to the students outside the classroom (including those in the restroom):
\[ 23 + 7 = 30 \]

So, Carla teaches 30 students in total.

First, let's determine the number of students who are absent. We know that 2 students are in the restroom. One less than three times that number of students are absent. This means that the number of absent students can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Absent Students} = 3 \times (2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of students in the classrooms. There are four rows with six desks each. Since the desks are 2/3 full, the number of students per row is:
\[ \text{Students per Row} = 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \]
So, the total number of students in the classrooms is:
\[ \text{Total Students in Classrooms} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Now, we know that Carla is also teaching a class with 2 students in the restroom and 5 students absent. Therefore, the total number of students, including those in and out of the classroom, is:
\[ \text{Total Students} = 2 \text{ (in restroom)} + 5 \text{ (absent)} + 16 \text{ (in classrooms)} = 23 \]

First, we need to determine how many students are in the restroom. Carla knows that 2 students are in the restroom.

Next, we calculate the number of absent students. According to the problem, one less than three times the number of students in the restroom are absent. Three times 2 is 6, and one less than that is 5. So, there are 5 absent students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are in the classroom. There are four rows of desks with six desks each, making a total of \(4 \times 6 = 24\) desks. Since the desks are 2/3 full, the number of students in the classroom is \(24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16\).

Adding up all the students, including those in and out of the classroom, we have:
- In the classroom: 16 students

Next, let's calculate the number of absent students. It is one less than three times the number of students in the restroom, so we can calculate this as follows: 3*2 - 1.
Then, let's calculate the number of desks occupied. We are told that there are four rows with six desks each that are all 2/3 full, so we can calculate this as follows: (4*6)*2/3.
Now, let's calculate the total number of students. We know that there are 2 students in the restroom and the number of absent students, so we can add these together. Then, we can add the number of occupied desks to this total to get the total number of students in the classroom. 
We should also account for the students outside of the classroom, which is 2. 
Adding all these together, we get the total number of students Carla teaches.

Let's calculate the number of students in each row first. Each row has six desks, and each desk is 2/3 full, which means there are 2/3 * 6 = 4 students in each row. Since there are four rows, there are 4 * 4 = 16 students in the classroom. 

Carla knows that 2 students are in the restroom. 

The number of absent students is one less than three times the students in the restroom. Therefore, the number of absent students is 3 * 2 - 1 = 5 students.

To find the total number of students Carla teaches, we add the students in the classroom, the students in the restroom, and the absent students:
