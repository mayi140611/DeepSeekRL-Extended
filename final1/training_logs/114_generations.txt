To find out how many pets Ed has in total, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ed has 2 dogs and 3 cats.
2. The combined total of dogs and cats is 2 + 3 = 5.
3. Ed has twice as many fish as dogs and cats combined, so he has 2 * 5 = 10 fish.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of dogs, cats, and fish:

2 dogs + 3 cats + 10 fish = 15 pets

Therefore, Ed has a total of 15 pets.

To find the total number of pets Ed has, we first need to determine the number of fish he has. Since Ed has twice as many fish as the number of cats and dogs combined, we can calculate the number of cats and dogs combined and then double that number.

Number of cats: 3
Number of dogs: 2
Number of cats and dogs combined: 3 + 2 = 5

Number of fish: 5 * 2 = 10

Now, we add up the number of dogs, cats, and fish to find the total number of pets.

Number of dogs: 2
Number of cats: 3
Number of fish: 10

Total number of pets: 2 + 3 + 10 = 15

Therefore, Ed has a total of 15 pets.

To determine the total number of pets Ed has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

First, we know that Ed has 2 dogs and 3 cats. Next, we calculate the number of fish. According to the problem, Ed has twice as many fish as the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]
Therefore, the number of fish is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and fish together:
\[ 2 + 3 + 10 = 15 \]

So, Ed has a total of:
\[ \boxed{15} \]

pets.

To determine the total number of pets Ed has, let's start by calculating the number of fish he owns.

1. Ed has 2 dogs and 3 cats.
2. Combined, Ed has 2 (dogs) + 3 (cats) = 5 pets from dogs and cats.

Since Ed has twice as many fish as the total number of cats and dogs combined:
3. Number of fish = 2 * (number of cats + number of dogs) = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now let's calculate the total number of pets Ed has:
4. Total number of pets = number of cats + number of dogs + number of fish
                      = 3 + 2 + 10
                      = 15.

5. Therefore, Ed has 15 pets in total.

End of reasoning.

Let's solve this step by step. 

First, we calculate the total number of dogs and cats:
Dogs = 2
Cats = 3

Combined total of dogs and cats = 2 + 3 = 5

Ed has twice as many fish as the combined total of dogs and cats. 
Therefore, the number of fish = 5 Ã— 2 = 10

Adding the number of dogs, cats, and fish, we get:
Total pets = Dogs + Cats + Fish 
              = 2 + 3 + 10
              = 15

Therefore, the answer is 15.

Let's calculate the number of fish first. Since Ed has 2 dogs and 3 cats, the number of fish is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now we sum up all the pets: dogs = 2, cats = 3, fish = 6. That makes 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 total pets. 

Therefore, the answer is 11.

First, we calculate the total number of cats and dogs combined. Ed has 2 dogs and 3 cats, so:
\[ 2 \text{ dogs} + 3 \text{ cats} = 5 \text{ cats and dogs combined} \]

Next, we are told that Ed has twice as many fish as the number of cats and dogs combined. Therefore, he has:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fish} \]

Now, to find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and fish together:
\[ 2 \text{ dogs} + 3 \text{ cats} + 10 \text{ fish} = 15 \text{ pets} \]

So, Ed has 15 pets in total.
