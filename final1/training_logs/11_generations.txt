To determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we need to calculate how much money he saved from his allowance and from mowing lawns. Then we can figure out how much he earned from shoveling driveways.

Step 1: Calculate the total allowance Tobias received over the past three months.
\[ 3 \text{ months} \times \$5 \text{ per month} = \$15 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total money Tobias saved from mowing lawns.
\[ 4 \text{ lawns} \times \$15 \text{ per lawn} = \$60 \]

Step 3: Let \( d \) represent the number of driveways Tobias shoveled. The total money he earned from shoveling driveways is:
\[ d \text{ driveways} \times \$7 \text{ per driveway} = 7d \]

Step 4: The total amount of money Tobias had before buying the shoes is the sum of his allowance, savings from mowing lawns, and his earnings from shoveling driveways.
\[ \$15 + \$60 + 7d = \$95 \]

Step 5: Solve the equation for \( 7d \):
\[ 7d = \$95 - (\$15 + \$60) \]
\[ 7d = \$95 - \$75 \]
\[ 7d = \$20 \]

Step 6: Solve for \( d \):
\[ d = \frac{\$20}{7} \]
\[ d \approx 2.857 \]

Since the number of driveways must be a whole number, Tobias shoveled 2 driveways.

Answer:
Tobias shoveled \(\boxed{2}\) driveways.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Tobias had before buying the shoes:**
   - Tobias has been saving for 3 months.
   - He gets $5 allowance per month.
   - He mowed 4 lawns, and each lawn costs $15 to mow.
   - He also shoveled driveways, and each driveway costs $7.

   First, calculate his total allowance:
   \[
   3 \text{ months} \times \$5 \text{ per month} = \$15
   \]

   Next, calculate the money from mowing lawns:
   \[
   4 \text{ lawns} \times \$15 \text{ per lawn} = \$60
   \]

   Now, calculate the money from shoveling driveways:
   \[
   ? \text{ driveways} \times \$7 \text{ per driveway}
   \]

   The total amount before buying the shoes is the sum of his savings and the money from mowing and shoveling:
   \[
   \$15 \text{ (allowance)} + \$60 \text{ (from mowing)} + ? \text{ (from shoveling)} = \$95 \text{ (total before buying shoes)}
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   \$15 + \$60 + ? = \$95
   \]
   \[
   \$75 + ? = \$95
   \]
   \[
   ? = \$95 - \$75
   \]
   \[
   ? = \$20
   \]

2. **Determine how many driveways he shoveled:**
   - Each driveway costs $7.
   - He has $20 from shoveling driveways.

   Calculate the number of driveways:
   \[
   \frac{\$20}{\$7 \text{ per driveway}} = \frac{20}{7} \approx 2.86
   \]
   Since Tobias can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   \text{Number of driveways} = 2
   \]

So, Tobias shoveled 2 driveways.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate total savings from allowance:**
   - Since Tobias earns $5 per month and saves for 3 months:
   \[
   \text{Total allowance} = 5 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 3 \, \text{months} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - He mows 4 lawns and charges $15 per lawn:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from lawns} = 4 \, \text{lawns} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/lawn} = 60 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate total earnings from shoveling driveways:**
   - He has $15 left after buying the shoes, and the shoes cost $95:
   \[
   \text{Money left after buying shoes} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   - After accounting for allowance and mowing lawn earnings:
   \[
   \text{Money from shoveling driveways} = 15 \, \text{dollars} + 15 \, \text{dollars} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   - Since he charges $7 per driveway:
   \[
   \text{Number of driveways shovelled} = \frac{30 \, \text{dollars}}{7 \, \text{dollars/driveway}} = 4.2857
   \]
   - Since the number of driveways must be a whole number and he can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   \text{Number of driveways shovelled} = 4
   \]

4. **Verify total amount saved:**

   - Money from allowance: $15
   - Money from mowing lawns: $60
   - Money from shovelling driveways: $30
   \[
   \text{Total amount saved} = 15 \, \text{dollars} + 60 \, \text{dollars} + 30 \, \text{dollars} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   - Add the cost of the shoes:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 105 \, \text{dollars} + 95 \, \text{dollars} = 200 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

   - Subtract the cost of the shoes:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 200 \, \text{dollars} - 95 \, \text{dollars} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   - This matches the remaining money Tobias has after buying the shoes and the change he received.

**Conclusion:**

Tobias shoveled 4 driveways.

To solve this problem, let's first calculate how much money Tobias has saved over the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance per month, so for three months, he has saved:

3 months * $5/month = $15

Tobias also mows lawns and shovels driveways to save money. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel a driveway. If he mows 4 lawns, he earns:

4 lawns * $15/lawn = $60

Now, we add this to the money he saved from his allowance:

$15 allowance + $60 from mowing = $75

After buying the shoes, Tobias has $15 in change left. So, before buying the shoes, he had:

$75 total - $95 cost = -$20

This means Tobias still owed $20 before buying the shoes. So he still needs to earn $20 more after buying the shoes:

$95 - $15 change = $80

Now, we subtract the money he has already earned from mowing lawns:

$80 needed - $60 from mowing = $20 remaining

Since he earns $7 per driveway, we can find out how many driveways he shoveled by dividing the remaining money by $7:

$20 remaining / $7 driveway = 2.857 driveways

Since he can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, he must have shoveled 2 driveways.

So, Tobias shoveled 2 driveways.

To determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Tobias saved over the past three months.
2. Determine how much money Tobias made from mowing lawns.
3. Use the information about his final amount of money to find out how much he earned from shoveling driveways.
4. Calculate the number of driveways he shoveled.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money saved over three months:**
   \[
   Total\ Savings = (Allowance\ per\ Month \times 3) + (Money\ From\ Mowing\ Lawns \times 4)
   \]
   \[
   Total\ Savings = (5 \times 3) + (15 \times 4)
   \]
   \[
   Total\ Savings = 15 + 60 = 75
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of money Tobias earned from mowing lawns:**
   \[
   Total\ Money\ from\ Mowing\ Lawns = 15 \times 4 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine how much Tobias earned from shoveling driveways:**
   \[
   Total\ Money\ Earned\ from\ Shoveling\ = Total\ Savings - Total\ Money\ from\ Mowing\ Lawns
   \]
   \[
   Total\ Money\ Earned\ from\ Shoveling\ = 75 - 60 = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of driveways Tobias shoveled:**
   \[
   Number\ of\ Driveways\ Shoveled = \frac{Total\ Money\ from\ Shoveling}{Money\ Earned\ from\ One\ Shovel}
   \]
   \[
   Number\ of\ Driveways\ Shoveled = \frac{15}{7}
   \]

Since Tobias can't shove a fraction of a driveway, we need to re-evaluate our steps. Let's recompute the earnings:

\[ 
Total\ Money\ Earned\ from\ Shoveling\ = 75 - 60 = 15 

\]

Since each driveway earns him $7, then the number of driveways shoveled is:

\[ 
Number\ of\ Driveways\ Shoveled = \frac{15}{7} 
\]

This calculation reveals a fractional number of driveways, indicating an issue with interpretation or a potential miscalculation. Therefore, we'll round to the nearest whole number:

\[ 
Number\ of\ Driveways\ Shoveled = \lceil \frac{15}{7} \rceil = 2 
\]

Finally, we'll check if 2 driveways are correct by calculating:

\[ 
Shoveling\ 2\ Driveways\ = 7 \times 2 = 14 
\]

\[ 
Total\ Money\ Earned\ from\ Shoveling\ = 75 - 14 = 61 \]

There appears to be a contradiction with the problem statement. Let's verify the calculations again:

\[ 
Allowance\ over\ 3\ months\ = 3 \times 5 = 15 
\]

\[ 
Shoveling\ 4\ Driveways\ = 7 \times 4 = 28 
\]

\[ 
Total\ Money\ Earned\ from\ Shoveling\ = 61 
\]

\[ 
Total\ Money\ Savings\ = 75 
\]

This indicates the problem lies in the allowance deduction or mowing lawn earnings. The calculations

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Tobias's total savings before buying the shoes:**
   - Tobias has been saving his allowance for three months, getting $5 per month.
   - Total savings from allowance: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Calculate Tobias's total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Tobias mows 4 lawns, and charges $15 for each lawn.
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns: \(4 \times 15 = 60\) dollars.

3. **Calculate Tobias's total earnings from shoveling driveways:**
   - Let \(d\) be the number of driveways Tobias shoveled.
   - He charges $7 per driveway.
   - Total earnings from shoveling driveways: \(7d\) dollars.

4. **Total amount saved including savings and earnings:**
   - Amount after buying the shoes: \(95 - 15 = 80\) dollars.
   - Total savings including allowance, mowing lawns, and shoveling driveways: \(15 + 60 + 7d = 80\) dollars.

5. **Solve for the number of driveways \(d\):**
   - \(15 + 60 + 7d = 80\).
   - Combine constants: \(75 + 7d = 80\).
   - Subtract 75 from both sides: \(7d = 5\).
   - Divide by 7: \(d = \frac{5}{7}\).

6. **Verify the solution:**
   - If \(d = \frac{5}{7}\), then shoveling \(\frac{5}{7}\) driveways means he would have \(7 \times \frac{5}{7} = 5\) driveways.
   - This calculation seems incorrect because the number of driveways must be a whole number. Let's re-evaluate the setup.

Upon re-evaluating, let's consider the correct approach:

1. **Correct calculation for the total earnings:**
   - Allowance: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
   - Lawns: \(4 \times 15 = 60\) dollars.
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways: \(15 + 60 = 75\) dollars.
   - Total money needed: \(95\) dollars.
   - Money left after buying shoes: \(95 - 80 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Re-evaluate total earnings:**
   - Allowance: \(15\) dollars.
   - Lawns: \(60\) dollars.
   - Let \(d\) be the number of driveways.
   - Total earnings: \(15 + 60 + 7d = 80\) dollars.

3. **Correct solution:**
   - Solve \(15 + 60 + 7d = 80\).
   - \(15 + 60 = 75\).
   - \(75 + 7d = 80\).
   - \(7d = 5\).
   - \(d = \frac{5}{7}\).

The number of driveways Tobias shoveled is \(\boxed{1}\).

To determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Tobias saved:
   - He had saved $95, which was the cost of the shoes.
   - He had $15 in change after buying the shoes, so the total amount of money saved is $95 + $15 = $110.

2. Determine how much of this total was saved from his allowance:
   - Tobias got a $5 allowance per month for three months, so he saved $5 \times 3 = $15 from his allowance.

3. Calculate the total amount saved from mowing lawns:
   - Tobias mowed 4 lawns at $15 each, so he saved $15 \times 4 = $60 from mowing lawns.

4. Determine how much money Tobias earned from shoveling driveways:
   - The total amount saved from all sources is $110. Subtracting the amounts saved from allowance and mowing lawns gives us the amount saved from shoveling driveways: $110 - $15 - $60 = $35.

5. Calculate how many driveways Tobias shoveled:
   - Tobias charges $7 to shovel one driveway, so the number of driveways shoveled is $35 \div $7 = 5.

Therefore, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.

Reasoning:
1. First, let's determine how much Tobias earned from his allowance in 3 months:
   Allowance per month = $5
   Total allowance for 3 months = $5 * 3 = $15
2. Then, let's calculate how much Tobias earned from mowing lawns. He mows 4 lawns, and charges $15 per lawn:
   Money earned from mowing = $15 * 4 = $60
3. Let's add the allowance and money earned from mowing to the cost of the shoes:
   Total expenses = Cost of shoes + Change
   $95 + Change = Total expenses + $15 (allowance) + $60 (mowing)
4. Tobias has $15 left after buying the shoes, so let's subtract that from the total expenses to find the initial amount of money he had:
   $95 = Total expenses + $15 (change) - $15 (allowance)
   $95 = Total expenses - $0
   Total expenses = $95
5. Since Tobias earned $60 from mowing lawns, we can subtract that amount from the total expenses to find out how much he earned from shoveling driveways:
   Money earned from shoveling = Total expenses - Money earned from mowing
   Money earned from shoveling = $95 - $60 = $35

Answer:
To find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we divide the money he earned from shoveling by the price per driveway:
Number of driveways shovelled = Money earned from shovelling / Price per driveway
Number of driveways shovelled = $35 / $7 = 5

Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled.

1. **Calculate Tobias's total savings before buying the shoes:**
   - Total cost of the shoes: $95
   - Amount he had after buying the shoes: $15
   - Money he had before buying the shoes: $95 - $15 = $80

2. **Calculate the total amount Tobias earned from his allowance:**
   - He gets a $5 allowance each month.
   - He has been saving for 3 months.
   - Total allowance: $5 × 3 = $15

3. **Calculate the total amount Tobias earned from mowing lawns:**
   - He mowed 4 lawns.
   - Fee per lawn: $15
   - Total from lawns: $15 × 4 = $60

4. **Calculate the total amount Tobias earned from shoveling driveways:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of driveways he shoveled.
   - Fee per driveway: $7
   - Total from driveways: $7x

5. **Calculate the total amount Tobias earned from his jobs before buying the shoes:**
   - Money from allowance: $15
   - Money from mowing lawns: $60
   - Money from shoveling driveways: $7x
   - Total earnings: $15 + $60 + $7x

6. **Determine the total amount he had before buying the shoes:**

\[ 15 + 60 + 7x = 80 \]

\[ 75 + 7x = 80 \]

\[ 7x = 80 - 75 \]

\[ 7x = 5 \]

\[ x = \frac{5}{7} \]

Since the number of driveways must be a whole number, let's verify the problem constraints and recalculate if necessary.

Let's recheck the calculation:

\[ 7x = 5 \]

Since no solution fits exactly with whole numbers, re-evaluate problem constraints or verify if there are any misinterpretations. 

After re-reading, it seems the calculation should be:

\[ 7x = 5 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, this indicates potential misinterpretation or a unique scenario. Let's assume he mowed at least one lawns to cover the shortfall. 

\[ 7x > 5 \]

Re-calculate:

\[ 7x = 5.6 (\text{approximated}) \]

Since this is not feasible, we revisit problem constraints:
- Recheck allowance and savings directly.

\[ Allowance: \$15 \]
\[ Lawns: 4 \]
\[ Shoveling: \( x \)

Directly check if \( 4 \times 15 + 7x - 5 >= 80 \):
- If \( x = 7 \)

So, verify correctly: Tobias must have mowed 4 lawns and shoveled 7 driveways to fit all criteria.

Thus, he shoveled 7 driveways.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Tobias has saved from his allowance and from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Tobias has been saving $5 each month for the past three months, so the total amount saved from his allowance is \(3 \times $5 = $15\).
2. Tobias charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel a driveway. If he mows 4 lawns, then the total money earned from mowing lawns is \(4 \times $15 = $60\).
3. Let's assume he shovels \(x\) driveways. Then the total money earned from shoveling driveways is \(x \times $7\).
4. At the end of three months, Tobias has $15 in change after buying the shoes. Therefore, the total money he had three months ago must be \( $95 + $15 = $110\).
5. Since he earned $60 from mowing lawns, the total money earned from mowing and shoveling must be \( $60 + x \times $7\).
6. Setting up the equation, we have \( $60 + x \times $7 = $110\).
7. Solving for \(x\), we get \( x \times $7 = $110 - $60 \), which simplifies to \( x \times $7 = $50 \).
8. Therefore, \( x = \frac{$50}{$7} = 7.14 \).

Since the number of driveways must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us \( x = 7 \).

Finally, Tobias earned $50 from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways. Since he has $50 left after buying the shoes, the amount earned from shoveling driveways is $50 - $5 = $45. Dividing $45 by the $7 charge per driveway, we get \( x = \frac{$45}{$7} = 6 \) driveways.

However, there seems to be a contradiction since the previous step suggested \( x = 7.14 \). Upon re-evaluating, it appears the correct approach should consider that the total money earned from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways should equal $110 exactly. Given the allowance money and the cost of the shoes, it seems that Tobias earned $60 from mowing lawns and $50 from shoveling driveways, which adds up to $110.

Therefore, Tobias earned $50 from shoveling driveways, which means he shovelled 7 driveways.

The answer is that Tobias shoveled 7 driveways.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Tobias has saved. We start by calculating his total earnings from his allowance and additional jobs.

Tobias gets $5 allowance per month for 3 months, so his total allowance earnings are:
\[
5 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate his earnings from mowing lawns. He mows 4 lawns at a rate of $15 per lawn:
\[
15 \text{ dollars/lawn} \times 4 \text{ lawns} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Tobias also charges $7 per driveway for shoveling driveways. Let's denote the number of driveways he shovels as \( x \). Therefore, his total earnings from shoveling driveways are:
\[
7 \text{ dollars/drive} \times x \text{ driveways} = 7x \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum up all of Tobias' earnings:
\[
15 \text{ (allowance)} + 60 \text{ (lawns)} + 7x \text{ (driveways)} = 75 + 7x \text{ dollars}
\]

Tobias spent $95 on the shoes and had $15 left as change. Therefore, his total savings are:
\[
75 + 7x - 95 = 15
\]

We solve for \( x \) by rearranging the equation:
\[
75 + 7x - 95 = 15 \\
75 - 95 + 7x = 15 \\
-20 + 7x = 15 \\
7x = 35 \\
x = 5

First, we add up Tobias's total savings for the past three months. Since he receives a $5 allowance each month, his total savings from the allowance is $5 x 3 = $15.

Next, we know that Tobias mowed 4 lawns, and he charges $15 for each lawn. So, his total earnings from mowing lawns is $15 x 4 = $60.

Now, we know that Tobias also earned $15 from shoveling driveways. Adding his earnings from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways to his total savings, we get $15 + $60 + $15 = $90.

Finally, we know that Tobias bought a pair of shoes that cost $95 and he has $15 in change. So, his total earnings before buying the shoes were $95 + $15 = $110.

To find out how many driveways he shoveled, we subtract his total savings from his total earnings before buying the shoes. So, if he saved $90, he earned $110 - $90 = $20 from shoveling driveways.

Since he charges $7 to shovel a driveway, we divide his earnings from shoveling driveways by the price per driveway to find how many driveways he shoveled. So, if he earned $20 and charges $7 per driveway, he shoveled $20 / $7 = 2.857 driveways.

Therefore, he shoveled 2 driveways.

To determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we first need to calculate how much money he saved. We know the total cost of the shoes is $95, and he has $15 left after buying them, which means he spent $95 - $15 = $80 on the shoes.

Next, we calculate how much money Tobias saved by receiving his allowance. He receives an allowance of $5 each month for the past three months, so he saved 3 * $5 = $15 from his allowance.

Now, we know how much money Tobias earned from mowing lawns. He mowed 4 lawns at $15 each, so he earned 4 * $15 = $60 from mowing lawns.

Let's denote the number of driveways Tobias shoveled as d. He earns $7 for each driveway, so he earned 7d dollars from shoveling driveways.

The total money he saved is the sum of his allowance savings and his earnings from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 15 + 60 + 7d = 80 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 75 + 7d = 80 \]

Subtract 75 from both sides:
\[ 7d = 5 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ d = \frac{5}{7} \]

Since the number of driveways must be a whole number, and \(\frac{5}{7}\) is not a whole number, it appears there might be an error in the problem setup or constraints. However, based on the given information and mathematical operations, the number of driveways Tobias shoveled is \(\frac{5}{7}\), which is not a whole number.

Therefore, there is an inconsistency in the problem as stated, and Tobias could not have shoveled \(\frac{5}{7}\) of a driveway. It would be necessary to re-evaluate the problem's constraints or data provided.

To determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we start by calculating his total savings before buying the shoes.

1. Calculate his monthly allowances:
   Tobias gets $5 allowance per month for 3 months.
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]

2. Calculate his earnings from mowing lawns:
   Tobias mows 4 lawns and charges $15 per lawn.
   \[
   15 \times 4 = 60
   \]

3. Calculate his earnings from shoveling driveways:
   Let \( x \) be the number of driveways Tobias shoveled. He charges $7 per driveway.
   \[
   7x
   \]

4. Calculate his total savings:
   Combine his allowances, lawn mowing earnings, and driveways shoveled earnings to get his total savings.
   \[
   15 + 60 + 7x = 75 + 7x
   \]

5. Determine the total amount of money Tobias has before buying the shoes.
   After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change left.
   \[
   75 + 7x = 100
   \]

6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   7x = 25
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{25}{7}
   \]

Tobias shoveled \(\frac{25}{7}\) driveways, which is approximately 3.57 driveways. Since the number of driveways shoveled must be a whole number, Tobias shoveled 3 driveways.

Therefore, the answer is 3 driveways.

Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Cost of the shoes and change received:** 
   Tobias spent $95 on new shoes and has $15 left. Therefore, the total amount he had saved before buying the shoes is:
   \[
   95 + 15 = 110 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total money from the allowance:**
   Tobias earns $5 per month for 3 months:
   \[
   5 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total money from mowing lawns:**
   Tobias mows 4 lawns and charges $15 per lawn:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars/lawn} \times 4 \text{ lawns} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Sum up the known incomes:**
   Add the allowance, the money from mowing lawns, and the money earned from shoveling driveways:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars (allowance)} + 60 \text{ dollars (mowing lawns)} + x \text{ dollars (shoveling driveways)}
   \]

   Where \( x \) is the money he earned from shoveling driveways. 

5. **Set up an equation to find \( x \):**
   The total amount of money he had before buying the shoes (110 dollars) should equal the sum of the allowance (15 dollars), the money from mowing lawns (60 dollars), and the money from shoveling driveways (x):
   \[
   110 = 15 + 60 + x
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   110 = 75 + x
   \]
   \[
   x = 110 - 75
   \]
   \[
   x = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Determine the number of driveways Tobias shoveled:**
   He charges $7 to shovel each driveway:
   \[
   \frac{35 \text{ dollars}}{7 \text{ dollars/driveway}} = 5 \text{ driveways}
   \]

**Conclusion:**
Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Tobias saved over the three months. First, let's calculate the total money he saved from his allowance:

\[ \text{Allowance from 3 months} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total money he earned from mowing lawns:

\[ \text{Earnings from mowing lawns} = 4 \times \$15 = \$60 \]

Let \( x \) represent the number of driveways Tobias shoveled. Each driveway he shoveled earns him $7, so the total money earned from shoveling driveways is:

\[ 7x \]

Now, we know that Tobias spent $95 on the shoes and was left with $15 after buying them, so the total amount of money he had before buying the shoes was:

\[ \text{Total money} = \$95 + \$15 = \$110 \]

Combining all these amounts, we get an equation for Tobias's total savings:

\[ 15 + 60 + 7x = 110 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 75 + 7x = 110 \]

Subtract 75 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 35 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 5 \]

So, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.
