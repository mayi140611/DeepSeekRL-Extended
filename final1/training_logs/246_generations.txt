system
The ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, which means for every 5 boys, there are 7 girls, making a total of 5 + 7 = 12 parts.

The total number of children is 180, so each part represents \( \frac{180}{12} = 15 \) children.

Since there are 5 parts for boys, the number of boys in the family is \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \).

The total amount given to the boys is $3900, so each boy receives \( \frac{3900}{75} = 52 \) dollars.

Let the number of boys be \(5x\) and the number of girls be \(7x\). The total number of children is given by:

\[5x + 7x = 180\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[12x = 180\]
\[x = 15\]

So, the number of boys is:

\[5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\]

The boys are given $3900 to share. Therefore, the amount each boy receives is:

\[\frac{3900}{75} = 52\]

The ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, and the total number of children is 180. This means the boys represent \( \frac{5}{5+7} = \frac{5}{12} \) of the total family.

To find the number of boys, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{5}{12} \times 180 = 75 \]

The boys are given $3900 to share. Therefore, each boy receives:
\[ \text{Amount per boy} = \frac{3900}{75} = 52 \]

The ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, which means that for every 5 boys, there are 7 girls. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 7 = 12 parts.

Each part of the ratio represents \( \frac{180}{12} = 15 \) children.

Since the boys are 5 parts, each boy receives \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) children.

The total amount given to the boys is $3900, so each boy receives \( \frac{3900}{5} = 780 \).

The ratio of boys to girls is 5x:7x, where x is a common factor. Therefore, the total number of children can be represented as 12x. Given that the total number of children is 180, we can solve for x: 12x = 180, which gives x = 15. Therefore, the number of boys is 5x = 75. The boys receive $3900 to share, so each boy receives $3900 / 75.

system
Let's denote the number of boys as \(B\) and the number of girls as \(G\). Given the ratio of boys to girls is \(5:7\), we can express this relationship as \(B:G = 5:7\). This means for every 5 boys, there are 7 girls. Therefore, the ratio of boys to the total number of children (boys + girls) is \(5:12\).

The total number of children in the family is given as 180. So, we can set up the equation based on the ratio to find the number of boys:
\[
\frac{B}{B + G} = \frac{5}{12}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(B + G\) gives:
\[
12B = 5(B + G)
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
12B = 5B + 5G \\
7B = 5G \\
7B + 5B = 7G + 5G \\
12B = 12G \\
B = G
\]
Since the total number of children is 180:
\[
B + G = 180 \\
B + B = 180 \\
2B = 180 \\
B = 90
\]
Each boy receives \(\frac{3900}{90} = 43\) dollars. Therefore, each boy receives \(43\) dollars.

The ratio of boys to girls is 5:7 and the total number of children is 180. This means that the sum of the parts of the ratio is \(5 + 7 = 12\). Therefore, each part of the ratio represents \(180 / 12 = 15\) children. Since there are 5 boys, each boyâ€™s share is \(3900 / 5 = 780\).

system
Let's denote the number of boys as \( B \) and the number of girls as \( G \). According to the given ratio of boys to girls, \( B : G = 5 : 7 \), we can express \( G \) in terms of \( B \) as \( G = \frac{7}{5}B \).

We are also given that the total number of children in the family is 180. Therefore, the sum of boys and girls is 180:
\[ B + G = 180 \]

Substituting \( G = \frac{7}{5}B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ B + \frac{7}{5}B = 180 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ \frac{5B + 7B}{5} = 180 \]
\[ \frac{12B}{5} = 180 \]

Multiplying both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[ 12B = 900 \]

Dividing both sides by 12:
\[ B = 75 \]

Now, we can find \( G \) using \( G = \frac{7}{5}B \):
\[ G = \frac{7}{5} \times 75 = 105 \]

The boys are given $3900 to share. To find out how much each boy receives, we divide the total amount by the number of boys:
\[ \text{Amount per boy} = \frac{3900}{75} = 52 \]

The ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, which means that for every 5 boys, there are 7 girls. The total number of children in the family is 180. This means that if we divide the total number of children into the number of parts represented by the ratio (5 + 7), we can find out how many children represent the boys and the girls.

Let's calculate the number of parts:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

This means that 12 parts make up 180 children. Now, we can find out how many children represent the boys and the girls by dividing:

For boys:
\[ \frac{5}{12} \times 180 \]

For girls:
\[ \frac{7}{12} \times 180 \]

However, we are not asked to find out how many children represent the boys and the girls, but rather how much each boy gets if they are given $3900 to share.

Since we are given that the boys are given $3900 to share, we just need to divide this amount among the boys.

\[ \text{Amount per boy} = \frac{3900}{5} \]

Now, let's calculate the amount each boy gets.

\[ \text{Amount per boy} = \frac{3900}{5} = 780 \]

So, each boy receives $780.

The ratio of boys to girls can be represented as 5x : 7x, where x is a common multiplier. The total number of children is the sum of boys and girls, which can be calculated as:

5x + 7x = 180
12x = 180
x = 180/12
x = 15

Now, we can find the actual number of boys and girls:

Number of boys = 5x = 5 * 15 = 75
Number of girls = 7x = 7 * 15 = 105

The boys are given $3900 to share:

Each boy receives = Total amount given / Number of boys
Each boy receives = 3900 / 75
Each boy receives = $52

1. **Determine the total ratio elements:**
   The ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, which means boys and girls together account for a total of:
   \[
   5 + 7 = 12 \text{ parts}
   \]

2. **Calculate the value of one part:**
   The total number of children in the family is 180, so each part of the ratio can be found by:
   \[
   \frac{180}{12} = 15 \text{ children per part}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   Since each part corresponds to 15 children:
   - The number of boys is:
   \[
   5 \times 15 = 75
   \]
   - The number of girls is:
   \[
   7 \times 15 = 105
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of money each boy receives:**
   The boys are given $3900 to share. Since there are 75 boys, each boy receives:
   \[
   \frac{3900}{75} = 52 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Each boy receives $52.
