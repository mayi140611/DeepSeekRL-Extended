#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Sally makes $6 per day, so in a year (assuming 365 days), she will make 6 * 365 = $2190. She decides to save half of what she earns, so she will save 2190 / 2 = $1095. Bob makes $4 per day, so in a year, he will make 4 * 365 = $1460. He will save half of what he earns, so he will save 1460 / 2 = $730. Together, Sally and Bob will have saved $1095 + $730 = $1825 for their trip after a year.

To calculate how much money Sally and Bob will both have saved for their trip after a year, we need to first find out how much each of them will earn in a year.

1. Sally's earnings in a year:
Sally makes $6 per day. There are 365 days in a year, so her earnings for the year are:
\[ \text{Sally's income yearly} = 6 \text{ dollars/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} \]

2. Bob's earnings in a year:
Bob makes $4 per day. Therefore, his earnings for the year:
\[ \text{Bob's income yearly} = 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} \]

3. Savings to be calculated:
Both Sally and Bob decide to save half of what they've earned. So, we need to calculate the savings for each of them and then sum them up.

\[ \text{Sally's savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sally's income yearly} \]
\[ \text{Bob's savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Bob's income yearly} \]

4. Total savings:
\[ \text{Total savings} = \text{Sally's savings} + \text{Bob's savings} \]

Let's perform the calculations:

\[ \text{Sally's income yearly} = 6 \times 365 = 2,190 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Bob's income yearly} = 4 \times 365 = 1,460 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Sally's savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2,190 = 1,095 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Bob's savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1,460 = 730 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Total savings} = 1,095 + 730 = 1,825 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sally and Bob will have saved a total of $1,825 for their trip after a year of babysitting.

First, let us calculate how much Sally and Bob earn per week. Sally makes $6 per day, so in a week she will make $6 x 7 = $42. Similarly, Bob makes $4 per day, so in a week he will make $4 x 7 = $28. Now, let us calculate their weekly savings. Sally's weekly savings will be $42 / 2, and Bob's will be $28 / 2. Adding the two amounts together, Sally and Bob will have a total of $21 + $14 or $35 for their trip after a year.

To find out how much money Sally and Bob will save after a year, we first need to calculate the amount each of them will save daily and then multiply by the number of days in a year (365 days).

Sally makes $6 per day. So, Sally's daily savings for her trip are:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} = 2190 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Bob makes $4 per day. So, Bob's daily savings for his trip are:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} = 1460 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, to find out how much money both Sally and Bob will have saved for their trip after a year, we add their daily savings:

Sally's total savings for the year:
\[ 2190 \text{ dollars/year} \]
Bob's total savings for the year:
\[ 1460 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Adding both her and his:
\[ 2190 \text{ dollars} + 1460 \text{ dollars} = 3650 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sally and Bob will have saved a total of $3650 for their trip after a year.

To find out how much money Sally and Bob will have saved for their trip, we first need to calculate their total earnings.

Sally's total earnings for the year = Sally's daily rate * 365 days = $6 * 365 = $2190

Bob's total earnings for the year = Bob's daily rate * 365 days = $4 * 365 = $1460

Now, we find out how much each person will save. Since they both save half of what they've earned, Sally will save half of $2190 = $2190/2 = $1095

Bob will save half of $1460 = $1460/2 = $730

Therefore, Sally and Bob will have saved a total of $1095 + $730 = $1825 for their trip after a year.

To calculate how much money Sally and Bob will save for their trip after a year, we need to first determine how much each of them will earn in a year. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply their daily earnings by 365 to find out how much they will earn in a year.

Sally earns $6 per day, so in a year, she will earn:
$$6 \times 365 = 2190$$

Bob earns $4 per day, so in a year, he will earn:
$$4 \times 365 = 1460$$

Now, Sally and Bob decide to save half of what they have earned for their trip. So, the amount of money Sally will save is half of her earnings in a year:
$$\frac{2190}{2} = 1095$$

And the amount of money Bob will save is half of his earnings in a year:
$$\frac{1460}{2} = 730$$

Now, we add Sally's and Bob's savings to find out how much money they both have saved for their trip in a year:
$$1095 + 730 = 1825$$

Therefore, Sally and Bob will both have saved $1825 for their trip after a year.

To calculate how much money Sally and Bob will have saved for their trip after a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Sally's earnings for the year:
   Sally makes $6 per day. There are 365 days in a year.
   Sally's earnings = $6/day * 365 days = $2190

2. Calculate Bob's earnings for the year:
   Bob makes $4 per day. There are 365 days in a year.
   Bob's earnings = $4/day * 365 days = $1460

3. Calculate the total earnings for the year:
   Total earnings = Sally's earnings + Bob's earnings = $2190 + $1460 = $3650

4. Since they decide to save half of what they've earned for their trip, we calculate the saving:
   Saving per person = Total earnings / 2 = $3650 / 2 = $1825

5. Total saving for both Sally and Bob:
   Total saving = Saving per person * 2 = $1825 * 2 = $3650

Therefore, Sally and Bob will both have saved $3650 for their trip after a year.

To calculate how much Sally and Bob will both have saved for their trip after a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in a year. For simplicity, let's assume a standard 365-day year.
2. Calculate Sally's earnings over the course of a year, which is \(6 \text{ dollars/day} \times 365 \text{ days} = 2190 \text{ dollars}\).
3. Calculate Bob's earnings over the course of a year, which is \(4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 365 \text{ days} = 1460 \text{ dollars}\).
4. Since Sally and Bob decide to save half of their earnings for their trip, we can calculate their savings separately:

   - Sally's savings: \(\frac{2190 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 1095 \text{ dollars}\)
   - Bob's savings: \(\frac{1460 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 730 \text{ dollars}\)

5. To find the total amount they will have saved for their trip, we add Sally's and Bob's savings together: \(1095 \text{ dollars} + 730 \text{ dollars} = 1825 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, Sally and Bob will have saved a total of 1825 dollars for their trip after a year.

Sally makes $6 per day, so for a year at 365 days she would have made:
$6/day * 365 days = $2190

Bob makes $4 per day, so for a year at 365 days he would have made:
$4/day * 365 days = $1460

Half of what they've earned goes to saving for the trip, so Sally would have saved:
$2190/2 = $1095

And Bob would have saved:
$1460/2 = $730

Therefore, after a year in total they will have saved:

To calculate how much money Sally and Bob will have saved for their trip, we first need to determine the total earnings of each before considering the savings.

Sally's daily earnings: $6
Bob's daily earnings: $4

Total daily earnings of Sally and Bob:
\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \]

This calculation assumes they work every day with the same hourly rate. However, since they save half of their earnings, we need to take into account the savings portion.

For Sally, since she saves half of what she earns:
\[ \text{Sally's savings per day} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

For Bob, since he also saves half of what he earns:
\[ \text{Bob's savings per day} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

To find the total savings after a year, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a year, assuming a 365-day year:
\[ \text{Total savings} = \text{Sally's daily savings} + \text{Bob's daily savings} \times 365 \]
\[ = 3 + 2 \times 365 \]

Now we calculate the final amount:

\[ 2 \times 365 = 730 \]

\[ 3 + 730 = 733 \]

So, after a year, Sally and Bob together will have saved $733 for their trip.

To find out how much money Sally and Bob will have saved for their trip after a year, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate how much money each receives per day
- Sally's daily earnings: $6
- Bob's daily earnings: $4

### Step 2: Determine how many days there are in a year
- Typically, a common approximation for a year is 365 days.

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings per week for Sally
- Sally's weekly earnings: \(6 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 42 \, \text{dollars/week}\)

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings per week for Bob
- Bob's weekly earnings: \(4 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 28 \, \text{dollars/week}\)

### Step 5: Determine the amount they each save per week
- Sally saves half of her weekly earnings: \(42 \, \text{dollars/week} \times \frac{1}{2} = 21 \, \text{dollars/week}\)
- Bob saves half of his weekly earnings: \(28 \, \text{dollars/week} \times \frac{1}{2} = 14 \, \text{dollars/week}\)

### Step 6: Determine the amount they each save per week over a year
- Sally saves over 52 weeks: \(21 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 52 \, \text{weeks} = 1,092 \, \text{dollars}\)
- Bob saves over 52 weeks: \(14 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 52 \, \text{weeks} = 728 \, \text{dollars}\)

### Step 7: Calculate the total savings for both
- Together, they save a total of \(1,092 \, \text{dollars} + 728 \, \text{dollars} = 1,820 \, \text{dollars}\) over a year.
