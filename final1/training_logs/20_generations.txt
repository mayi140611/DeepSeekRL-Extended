To determine the total number of stamps Bella bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp she purchased and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of snowflake stamps:
\[ \text{Number of snowflake stamps} = 11 \]

Next, we need to find the number of truck stamps. According to the problem, Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps:
\[ \text{Number of truck stamps} = 11 + 9 = 20 \]

Then, we need to find the number of rose stamps. The problem states that Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps:
\[ \text{Number of rose stamps} = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of each type of stamp together:
\[ \text{Total number of stamps} = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38 \]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Bella bought is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]

To find out the total number of stamps Bella bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp she purchased and then sum them up.

1. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
2. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is 11 + 9 = 20.
3. She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is 20 - 13 = 7.

Now, we sum up the number of stamps for each design:

Snowflake Stamps: 11
Truck Stamps: 20
Rose Stamps: 7

Total stamps = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38

Therefore, the answer is 38 stamps.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
2. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so she bought 11 + 9 = 20 truck stamps.
3. She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so she bought 20 - 13 = 7 rose stamps.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stamps:

- Snowflake stamps: 11
- Truck stamps: 20
- Rose stamps: 7

Total stamps = 11 (snowflake) + 20 (truck) + 7 (rose) = 38 stamps

Therefore, Bella bought a total of 38 stamps.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
2. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
3. She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.

First, let's find out how many truck stamps Bella bought:

Truck stamps = Snowflake stamps + 9
Truck stamps = 11 + 9
Truck stamps = 20

Now, let's find out how many rose stamps Bella bought:

Rose stamps = Truck stamps - 13
Rose stamps = 20 - 13
Rose stamps = 7

Now that we know the number of each type of stamp, we can add them all up to find out the total number of stamps Bella bought:

Total stamps = Snowflake stamps + Truck stamps + Rose stamps
Total stamps = 11 + 20 + 7
Total stamps = 38

Therefore, Bella bought 38 stamps in all.

To determine the total number of stamps Bella bought, we will start by defining variables for the number of each type of stamp and then use the given information to find a relationship between them.

Let:
- \( S \) represent the number of snowflake stamps,
- \( T \) represent the number of truck stamps,
- \( R \) represent the number of rose stamps.

According to the problem:
1. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
   \[
   S = 11
   \]

2. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
   \[
   T = S + 9
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( S \):
   \[
   T = 11 + 9 = 20
   \]

3. She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.
   \[
   R = T - 13
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( T \):
   \[
   R = 20 - 13 = 7
   \]

Now, to find the total number of stamps Bella bought, we sum the number of each type of stamp:
\[
\text{Total stamps} = S + T + R
\]
Substituting the values of \( S \), \( T \), and \( R \):
\[
\text{Total stamps} = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38
\]

Therefore, Bella bought a total of 38 stamps.

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as \( S \), the number of truck stamps as \( T \), and the number of rose stamps as \( R \).

From the information given, we have:
1. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps, so \( S = 11 \).
2. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so \( T = S + 9 \).
3. She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so \( R = T - 13 \).

First, we calculate \( T \):
\( T = S + 9 = 11 + 9 = 20 \)

Next, we calculate \( R \):
\( R = T - 13 = 20 - 13 = 7 \)

Now, we add up all the stamps:
\( S + T + R = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38 \)

Therefore, Bella bought 38 stamps in all.

Let's break down the given information:

1. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
2. Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
3. Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.

First, let's calculate the number of truck stamps. Since Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, we can find the number of truck stamps by adding 9 to the number of snowflake stamps:

Number of truck stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + 9
Number of truck stamps = 11 + 9
Number of truck stamps = 20

Next, let's calculate the number of rose stamps. Since Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, we can find the number of rose stamps by subtracting 13 from the number of truck stamps:

Number of rose stamps = Number of truck stamps - 13
Number of rose stamps = 20 - 13
Number of rose stamps = 7

Now, let's find the total number of stamps Bella bought:

Total number of stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + Number of truck stamps + Number of rose stamps
Total number of stamps = 11 + 20 + 7
Total number of stamps = 38

Therefore, Bella bought a total of 38 stamps.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.

2. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, she bought:
   11 (snowflake stamps) + 9 = 20 truck stamps.

3. She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So:
   20 (truck stamps) - 13 = 7 rose stamps.

4. To find the total number of stamps Bella bought, we add all types together:
   11 (snowflake) + 20 (truck) + 7 (rose) = 38 stamps.

To determine the total number of stamps Bella bought, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of each type of stamp:**
   - Snowflake stamps: \(11\)
   - Truck stamps: Bella bought \(9\) more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \(11 + 9 = 20\).
   - Rose stamps: Bella bought \(13\) fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \(20 - 13 = 7\).

2. **Calculate the total number of stamps:**
   - Add the number of each type of stamp together:
     \[
     11 \, (\text{snowflake stamps}) + 20 \, (\text{truck stamps}) + 7 \, (\text{rose stamps}) = 38

To find out the total number of stamps Bella bought, let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

Given:
1. S = 11 (snowflake stamps)
2. T = S + 9 (9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps)
3. R = T - 13 (13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps)
4. Total stamps = S + T + R

Let's calculate the number of truck stamps (T):
T = 11 + 9 = 20

Next, we calculate the number of rose stamps (R):
R = 20 - 13 = 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of stamps:
Total stamps = S + T + R
Total stamps = 11 + 20 + 7
Total stamps = 38

From the problem statement, we have:
1. \( S = 11 \)
2. \( T = S + 9 \)
3. \( R = T - 13 \)

First, we substitute the value of \( S \) into the second equation to find the number of truck stamps \( T \):
\[ T = 11 + 9 = 20 \]

Next, we substitute the value of \( T \) into the third equation to find the number of rose stamps \( R \):

Let's break down the information provided:
- Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
- She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
- She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.

First, let's find out how many truck stamps Bella bought. Since she bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and she bought 11 snowflake stamps, we can calculate the number of truck stamps as follows:
truck stamps = snowflake stamps + 9
truck stamps = 11 + 9 = 20

Next, let's find out how many rose stamps Bella bought. Since she bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, we can calculate the number of rose stamps as follows:
rose stamps = truck stamps - 13
rose stamps = 20 - 13 = 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of stamps Bella bought by adding the number of each type of stamp. We have:
