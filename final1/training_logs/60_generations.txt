To calculate the number of hours Jerry will spend at the field, we need to consider the time spent watching his daughters play in the games and the time spent watching them practice.

First, let's calculate the total time spent watching the daughters play in the games:
- Each daughter has 8 games.
- Each game lasts for 2 hours.

Total time spent watching daughters play = Number of daughters × Number of games per daughter × Time per game
= 2 daughters × 8 games per daughter × 2 hours per game
= 32 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time Jerry will spend watching his daughters practice:
- Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play.
- There are 8 games per season for each daughter.
- Each game lasts for 2 hours.

Total practice time for one daughter = Number of games per season × Practice time per game
= 8 games per season × 4 hours per game
= 32 hours

Since Jerry has two daughters, we multiply this value by 2:
Total practice time for both daughters = 2 daughters × 32 hours per daughter
= 64 hours

Now, we add the total time spent watching daughters play and the total time spent watching their practice to find the total number of hours Jerry will spend at the field:

Total hours Jerry will spend = Total time watching daughters play + Total practice time for both daughters
= 32 hours + 64 hours
= 96 hours

Therefore, Jerry will spend a total of 96 hours at the field watching his daughters play and practice.

To find out how many hours Jerry will spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice, we need to calculate the total hours spent on games and total hours spent on practices, then add them together.

1. Games: Each of the two daughters plays 8 games. Each game lasts 2 hours.
   - Total game hours: \(8 \text{ games} \times 2 \text{ hours/game} = 16 \text{ hours}\).

2. Practices: Each of the two daughters practices 4 hours for every game they play. So for 2 daughters, it is \(2 \times 4 \text{ hours/game} = 8 \text{ hours}\) for all games combined (8 games total).

3. Total time spent at field:
   - Hours spent on games: 16 hours
   - Hours spent on practices: 8 hours
   - Total time spent at field: 16 + 8 = 24 hours

Answer: Jerry will spend a total of 24 hours at the field watching his daughters play and practice.

To determine the total number of hours Jerry will spend at the field, we need to calculate the total time spent watching his daughters play and the total time spent on practice for each daughter.

First, let's calculate the time spent watching gameplay for one daughter:
- Each daughter has 8 games.
- Each game lasts 2 hours.
- Therefore, the total time spent watching gameplay for one daughter is:
  \[
  8 \text{ games} \times 2 \text{ hours/game} = 16 \text{ hours}
  \]

Since there are two daughters, the total time spent watching gameplay for both daughters is:
\[
16 \text{ hours/daughter} \times 2 \text{ daughters} = 32 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on practice for one daughter:
- Each daughter has 8 games.
- Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play.
- Since Jerry has two daughters, the total time spent on practice for both daughters is:
\[
8 \text{ games/daughter} \times 4 \text{ hours/game} = 32 \text{ hours/daughter}
\]
Since there are two daughters, the total time spent on practice for both daughters is:
\[
32 \text{ hours/daughter} \times 2 \text{ daughters} = 64 \text{ hours}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total time spent watching gameplay and the total time spent on practice for both daughters:
\[
32 \text{ hours} + 64 \text{ hours} = 96 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Jerry will spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether is:
\[
\boxed{96}
\]

First, calculate the total number of games played by both daughters: 8 games/daughter * 2 daughters = 16 games.

Next, consider the total time spent watching the games: 16 games * 2 hours/game = 32 hours.

Now, calculate the total time spent on practices: 16 games * 4 hours/game = 64 hours.

Finally, add the hours of watching and the hours of practice: 32 hours + 64 hours = 96 hours.

Therefore, the answer is 96.

To calculate the total hours Jerry will spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of practices for each daughter:
   - Each daughter plays 8 games.
   - Each game lasts 2 hours, so each game requires 8 * 2 = 16 hours of practice.
   - Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play.
   - Therefore, each daughter will have 8 * 4 = 32 hours of practice.

2. Since Jerry has two daughters, we double the total hours for one daughter:
   - Total hours for one daughter = 32 hours.
   - Total hours for both daughters = 32 * 2 = 64 hours.

3. Calculate the total number of games in the season:
   - Each daughter has 8 games.
   - Therefore, the total number of games in the season for both daughters = 8 + 8 = 16 games.

4. Calculate the total hours of play for both daughters:
   - The duration of each game is 2 hours.
   - There are 16 games in the season.
   - Therefore, the total hours of play for both daughters = 16 * 2 = 32 hours.

5. Add the total hours of practice and play to get the total hours:
   - Total hours of practice = 64 hours.
   - Total hours of play = 32 hours.
   - Total hours = 64 + 32 = 96 hours.

Therefore, Jerry will spend 96 hours at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether.

To calculate the total hours Jerry will spend at the field, we need to consider the time spent watching the games and the time spent on practices.

For the games:
- Each daughter has 8 games.
- Each game lasts 2 hours.

So, for one daughter:
\[8 \text{ games} \times 2 \text{ hours/game} = 16 \text{ hours/game}.\]

Since there are two daughters, the total hours watching games for one daughter is:
\[16 \text{ hours/game} \times 2 = 32 \text{ hours/game}.\]

Adding the time spent on practices:
- Each daughter's team practices 4 hours for every game they play.

So, for one daughter:
\[8 \text{ games} \times 4 \text{ hours/practice} = 32 \text{ hours/practice}.\]

The total hours spent on practices for one daughter is:
\[32 \text{ hours/practice} \times 2 = 64 \text{ hours/practice}.\]

To find the total hours spent watching games and practicing for one daughter:
\[32 \text{ hours/game} + 64 \text{ hours/practice} = 96 \text{ hours/daughter}.\]

Since there are two daughters:
\[96 \text{ hours/daughter} \times 2 = 192 \text{ hours}.\]

Therefore, Jerry will spend a total of 192 hours at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether.

First, we need to determine how many hours Jerry's daughters will play softball this season. Each daughter has 8 games, and each game lasts 2 hours, so each daughter will play for \(8 \times 2 = 16\) hours. Since there are two daughters, the total number of hours spent playing is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) hours.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours spent practicing. Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play. Since each daughter plays 8 games, the total number of games is \(8 \times 2 = 16\). Therefore, the total number of hours spent practicing is \(16 \times 4 = 64\) hours.

Finally, we add the total hours spent playing to the total hours spent practicing to get the total number of hours Jerry will spend at the field. This is \(32 + 64 = 96\) hours.

To determine the total hours Jerry will spend at the field, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total number of games and practices each daughter will have.

Each daughter has 8 games and 4 practices per game.

So, for one daughter:
- Number of games = 8
- Number of practices per game = 4
- Total practices per daughter = 8 games * 4 practices/game = 32 practices

Since both daughters have the same number of games and practices:
- Total games = 8 games * 2 daughters = 16 games
- Total practices = 16 practices * 2 daughters = 32 practices

Next, let's calculate the total hours for one daughter:

- Hours per game = 2 hours
- Total hours for games for one daughter = 16 games * 2 hours/game = 32 hours
- Hours per practice = 4 hours
- Total hours for practices for one daughter = 32 practices * 4 hours/practice = 128 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours for both daughters together:
- Total hours for games for both daughters = 32 hours (one daughter) * 2 daughters = 64 hours
- Total hours for practices for both daughters = 128 hours (one daughter) * 2 daughters = 256 hours

Finally, we sum up the total hours for games and practices for both daughters:
Total hours = Total hours for games + Total hours for practices
Total hours = 64 hours (games) + 256 hours (practices) = 320 hours

Therefore, the answer is 320 hours.

To determine how many hours Jerry will spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice, we need to calculate the total time spent on games and practices separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on games:
- Each daughter has 8 games.
- Each game lasts 2 hours.
- There are 2 daughters.

The total time spent on games is:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times 2 \text{ hours/game} \times 2 \text{ daughters} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on practices:
- Each daughter practices 4 hours for every game they play.
- There are 8 games per daughter.

The total hours of practice per daughter is:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times 4 \text{ hours/game} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 2 daughters, the total hours of practice for both daughters is:
\[ 32 \text{ hours/dad} \times 2 \text{ dads} = 64 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the total time spent on games and practices:
\[ 32 \text{ hours (games)} + 64 \text{ hours (practices)} = 96 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Jerry will spend \boxed{96} hours at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether.

To calculate the total number of hours Jerry will spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice, we need to multiply the number of games by the duration of each game and the number of practices per game.

1. Calculate the time spent watching the games:
   Each daughter has 8 games and each game lasts 2 hours.
   So, the time spent watching the games is 8 games * 2 hours/game = 16 hours.

2. Calculate the time spent on practices:
   Each daughter has 8 games, and for each game, they practice for 4 hours.
   So, the time spent on practices for one daughter is 8 games * 4 hours/game = 32 hours.
   Since there are two daughters, we multiply this by 2.
   So, the time spent on practices for both daughters is 32 hours/game * 2 daughters = 64 hours.

3. Calculate the total time spent at the field:
   Now, we add the time spent watching the games and the time spent on practices.
   So, the total time spent at the field is 16 hours + 64 hours = 80 hours.
