When Katherine is 2 dozen years old, she is 2 * 12 = 24 years old.
If Mel is three years younger than Katherine, then in 24 years, Mel will be 24 - 3 = 21 years old.

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote Katherine's current age as \( K \) and Mel's current age as \( M \). We know from the problem statement that Mel is three years younger than Katherine. This can be expressed as:
\[ M = K - 3 \]

We are also given that when Katherine is two dozen years old. Since one dozen is 12, two dozen is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]
So, when Katherine is 24 years old, Mel's age will be:
\[ M = 24 - 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, Mel will be 21 years old when Katherine is 24 years old.

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote Katherine's age as \( K \) and Mel's age as \( M \). According to the problem, Mel is three years younger than Katherine, so we can write the following relationship:
\[ M = K - 3 \]

We need to find out how old Mel will be when Katherine is two dozen years old. Two dozen years is equal to \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) years. So, when Katherine is 24 years old, we can substitute \( K = 24 \) into the equation \( M = K - 3 \):
\[ M = 24 - 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, when Katherine is 24 years old, Mel will be 21 years old.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's calculate Mel's age step by step:

1. First, we know that Katherine is two dozen years old. Since one dozen is equal to 12, two dozen is:
   2 * 12 = 24 years old.

2. Mel is three years younger than Katherine. So, to find Mel's age, we subtract 3 from Katherine's age:
   24 - 3 = 21 years.

Therefore, when Katherine is two dozen years old, Mel will be 21 years old.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote Katherine's current age as \( K \) and Mel's current age as \( M \). According to the problem, Mel is three years younger than Katherine, so we can write:
\[ M = K - 3 \]

The problem also states that when Katherine is two dozen years old. Since a dozen is 12, two dozen is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

So, in 24 years, Katherine will be 24 years old. At that time, Mel will be:
\[ M + 24 \]

Since Katherine will be 24 years old, we substitute \( K = 24 \) into the equation for Mel's age:
\[ M = 24 - 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, in 24 years, Mel will be:
\[ M + 24 = 21 + 24 = 45 \]

Thus, Mel will be 45 years old.

#### GENERATION 8 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's break this down step by step: 

First, we need to understand what Katherine is currently and what Mel is. We know that Mel is three years younger than Katherine and that when Katherine is two dozen years old, she is 24 years old (since two dozen equals 24).

Since Mel is three years younger than Katherine, we can calculate their current ages by subtracting three from Katherine's age:
24 - 3 = 21

Therefore, when Katherine is 24, Mel will be 21 years old.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that Mel is three years younger than Katherine.
2. When Katherine is two dozen years old, we need to convert this into a numerical value. Since "two dozen" means 2 x 12 = 24 years.
3. If Katherine is 24 years old, Mel's age would be 24 years - 3 years = 21 years.

So, Mel will be 21 years old when Katherine is 24 years old.

Let's break down the question:

1. We know that Mel is three years younger than Katherine.
2. We're told that when Katherine is two dozen years old, which is 24 years old.
3. To find out how old Mel is at that time, we subtract 3 years from Katherine's age:

   Katherine's age = 24 years
   Mel's age = Katherine's age - 3 years
               = 24 years - 3 years
               = 21 years

So, Mel will be 21 years old when Katherine is 24 years old.
