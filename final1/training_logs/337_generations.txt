To find the total number of people at the gathering, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The principle of inclusion-exclusion is a counting technique used to determine the total number of elements in two or more sets when the elements can share multiple entries.

Therefore, the total number of people at the gathering is the sum of people who took wine and soda minus the number of people who took both to avoid double counting:

Total people = People taking wine + People taking soda - People taking both
Total people = 26 + 22 - 17
Total people = 48 - 17
Total people = 31

So, 31 people altogether were at the gathering.

To find the total number of people at the gathering, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle allows us to find the total number of individuals by adding the number of people who took wine and the number of people who took soda, and then subtracting the number of individuals who took both to avoid double-counting.

The formula is:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{People taking wine}) + (\text{People taking soda}) - (\text{People taking both}) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Total} = 26 + 22 - 17 \]

\[ \text{Total} = 48 - 17 \]

\[ \text{Total} = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of people at the gathering is 31.

system
To determine the total number of people at the gathering, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion because people who took both wine and soda should be counted once, not twice.

First, let's break it down:
- Total number of people: \( x \)
- People who took wine only: \( 26 - 17 \) (since 17 people took both)
- People who took soda only: \( 22 - 17 \) (since 17 people took both)
- People who took both drinks: 17

Now, we can calculate the total number of distinct people who attended the gathering by adding the people who took wine only, those who took soda only, and those who took both:

\[ x = (26 - 17) + (22 - 17) + 17 \]

Let's solve this step-by-step:
1. Calculate the number of people who took wine only: \( 26 - 17 = 9 \)
2. Calculate the number of people who took soda only: \( 22 - 17 = 5 \)
3. The number of people who took both drinks: 17

Now, add all these together:

\[ x = 9 + 5 + 17 \]

\[ x = 31 \]

So, there were 31 people altogether at the gathering.

To determine the total number of people at the gathering, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's denote:
- \( W \) as the number of people who took wine.
- \( S \) as the number of people who took soda.
- \( B \) as the number of people who took both drinks.
- \( T \) as the total number of people at the gathering.

From the problem, we know:
- \( W = 26 \)
- \( S = 22 \)
- \( B = 17 \)

According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the total number of people who took either wine, soda, or both is given by:
\[ T = W + S - B \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ T = 26 + 22 - 17 \]
\[ T = 48 - 17 \]
\[ T = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of people at the gathering is 31.

To find the total number of people at the gathering, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps us avoid counting the people who took both drinks twice when we add the number of people who took wine and soda.

Let's denote the total number of people at the gathering as \( N \), the number of people who took wine as \( A = 26 \), the number of people who took soda as \( B = 22 \), and the number of people who took both drinks as \( A \cap B = 17 \).

The formula for the total number of people in the group, considering those who took at least one drink, is:
\[ N = (A \cup B) + (B \cap A) - A \cap B \]

Here, \( (A \cup B) \) represents the total number of people who took at least one drink (wine, soda, or both), and \( (B \cap A) \) is the number of people who took both drinks, which is given.

Plugging in the given values:
\[ N = (26 + 22) - 17 \]
\[ N = 48 - 17 \]
\[ N = 31 \]

Therefore, altogether, there were 31 people at the gathering.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of people at the gathering. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that to find the number of elements in the union of two sets (let's call them set A and set B), you add the number of elements in each set and then subtract the number of elements in their intersection.

Here, set A is the people who took wine, and set B is the people who took soda. We are given:
- |A| = 26 (people who took wine),
- |B| = 22 (people who took soda),
- |A âˆ© B| = 17 (people who took both drinks).

The formula to find the total number of people at the gathering is:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Plugging in the given values, we get:
\[ |A \cup B| = 26 + 22 - 17 \]

Now, let's calculate this expression.

To determine the total number of people at the gathering, we need to consider that some people could have taken both drinks, which means they were counted twice in the separate counts of those who took wine and those who took soda. The formula to find the total number of people is:

Total people = (Number taking wine) + (Number taking soda) - (Number taking both drinks)

Now, plug in the numbers:

Total people = 26 + 22 - 17 = 31

To find the total number of people at the gathering, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps us avoid double-counting those people who took both drinks.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of people who took wine,
- \( B \) as the set of people who took soda.

We are given:
- |\( A \)| = 26 (people who took wine),
- |\( B \)| = 22 (people who took soda),
- |\( A \cap B \)| = 17 (people who took both drinks).

The principle of inclusion-exclusion tells us that the total number of people (including those who took both drinks) is:

\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values, we get:

\[ |A \cup B| = 26 + 22 - 17 = 31 \]

So, there were 31 people at the gathering who took at least one drink.

Since no one is counted twice, the total number of people who took at least one drink (which is the same as the total number of people at the gathering) is 31.

Therefore, the total number of people altogether at the gathering is 31.

To find the total number of people at the gathering, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion because people who took both drinks are counted twice when we simply add the number of people who took wine and soda.

Let \( W \) represent the number of people who took wine, \( S \) the number who took soda, and \( B \) the number who took both drinks. We have:

- \( W = 26 \)
- \( S = 22 \)
- \( B = 17 \)

Using the formula for inclusion-exclusion to get the total number of unique people:

\[
\text{Total} = W + S - B
\]

\[
\text{Total} = 26 + 22 - 17
\]

\[
\text{Total} = 38 - 17 = 21

To find the total number of people at the gathering, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. This principle helps us find the total number of unique people when combining different groups.

Here's the reasoning:
1. The total number of people who took wine is 26.
2. The total number of people who took soda is 22.
3. The number of people who took both drinks is 17.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the formula to find the total number of people at the gathering is:

\[ \text{Total number of people} = (\text{Number of people who took wine}) + (\text{Number of people who took soda}) - (\text{Number of people who took both drinks}) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Total number of people} = 26 + 22 - 17 \]
\[ \text{Total number of people} = 48 - 17 \]
\[ \text{Total number of people} = 31 \]

So, the total number of people at the gathering was 31.

Let's denote the total number of people at the gathering as \( N \). According to the problem, 17 people took both wine and soda. The number of people who took only wine is the total number of people who took wine minus the number of people who took both drinks, which is \( 26 - 17 = 9 \). Similarly, the number of people who took only soda is the total number of people who took soda minus the number of people who took both drinks, which is \( 22 - 17 = 5 \).

The total number of people at the gathering is the sum of those who took only wine, only soda, and those who took both drinks. This can be expressed as:
\[ N = 9 + 5 + 17 \]

Now let's calculate the total:
\[ N = 9 + 5 + 17 = 31 \]
