To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote:
- \( N \) as the total number of students,
- \( F \) as the number of students who like French fries,
- \( B \) as the number of students who like burgers,
- \( F \cap B \) as the number of students who like both French fries and burgers.

Given:
- \( N = 25 \),
- \( F = 15 \),
- \( B = 10 \),
- \( F \cap B = 6 \).

First, we calculate the number of students who like either French fries or burgers or both:
\[ F \cup B = F + B - F \cap B. \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ F \cup B = 15 + 10 - 6 = 19. \]

Now, the number of students who do not like either food is:
\[ N - (F \cup B) = 25 - 19 = 6. \]

Therefore, there are 6 students who do not like either French fries or burgers.

To determine how many students do not like either French fries or burgers, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, calculate the total number of students who like either French fries or burgers or both:
- Students who like French fries: 15
- Students who like burgers: 10
- Students who like both: 6

The principle of inclusion and exclusion for these two sets is:

\[
\text{Total students} = \text{Students who like French fries} + \text{Students who like burgers} - \text{Students who like both}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{Total students} = 15 + 10 - 6 = 19
\]

This means there are 19 students who like at least one of the foods. Since there are 25 students in total, the number of students who do not like either food is:

\[
\text{Total students} - \text{Students who like at least one food} = 25 - 19 = 6
\]

So, 6 students do not like either French fries or burgers.

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let \( F \) represent the set of students who like French fries and \( B \) represent the set of students who like burgers.

From the problem, we have:
- \( |F| = 15 \) (students who like French fries)
- \( |B| = 10 \) (students who like burgers)
- \( |F \cap B| = 6 \) (students who like both French fries and burgers)

We need to find the number of students who like either French fries, burgers, or both. The principle of inclusion and exclusion states:
\[ |F \cup B| = |F| + |B| - |F \cap B| \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ |F \cup B| = 15 + 10 - 6 = 19 \]

So, 19 students like either French fries, burgers, or both.

Since there are 25 students in total, the number of students who do not like either food is:
\[ 25 - |F \cup B| = 25 - 19 = 6 \]

Therefore, 6 students do not like either French fries or burgers.

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many students like at least one of the two food items (French fries or burgers).

Let:
- \( A \) be the set of students who like French fries.
- \( B \) be the set of students who like burgers.

We know:
- \( |A| = 15 \) (students who like French fries)
- \( |B| = 10 \) (students who like burgers)
- \( |A \cap B| = 6 \) (students who like both French fries and burgers)

The number of students who like at least one of the two foods is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 15 + 10 - 6 = 29 \]

This means that 29 students like at least one of the two foods. Since there are 25 students in total, the number of students who do not like any of the two foods is:
\[ 25 - |A \cup B| = 25 - 29 = -4 \]

But since a negative number of students doesn't make sense, it must be that there are actually 11 students who do not like either French fries or burgers. This is because the 29 students who like at least one food include the 6 who like both, so the remaining 23 must be the 25 total students minus the 2 students who do not like any food.

So, there are 11 students who do not like either food.

First, we need to understand the total number of students and how many students fall into each of the three categories: those who like French fries only, those who like burgers only, those who like both, and those who like neither.

From the information given:
- Total number of students = 25
- Students who like French fries only = 15 - 6 = 9
- Students who like burgers only = 10 - 6 = 4
- Students who like both = 6

Now, sum these up to get the total number of students who like either French fries or burgers or both:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 25

2. **Students who like French fries**: 15  
   This includes those who like only French fries, those who like both dishes, and those who like neither.

3. **Students who like burgers**: 10  
   This includes those who like only burgers, those who like both dishes, and those who like neither.

4. **Students who like both dishes**: 6  
   These students are included in both the "like French fries" and "like burgers" categories. This category appears twice in the given total numbers and subtracts once from each group to avoid double-counting those students.

5. **Calculating the number of students who like only French fries**:
   Since 6 students like both French fries and burgers, and there are 15 students who like French fries in total, this means that out of the 6 students who like both dishes, 5 students also like only French fries (since 6 - 1 = 5).

6. **Calculating the number of students who like only burgers**:
   Similarly, since 6 students like both dishes, and there are 10 students who like burgers in total, this means that out of the 6 students who like both dishes, 4 students also like only burgers (since 6 - 2 = 4).

7. **Calculating the number of students who like neither dish**:
   We can now determine the number of students who like neither dish by subtracting the number of students who like French fries, burgers, or both from the total number of students:
   - Students who like French fries or both: 15 - 5 = 10
   - Students who like burgers or both: 10 - 4 = 6
   - Total students who like French fries or burgers or both: 10 + 6 = 16
   - Subtract this from the total number of students to find those who like neither: 25 - 16 = 9

So, 9 students do not like either French fries or burgers.

8. **Subtract the number of students who like both dishes**:
   There are 6 students who like both French fries and burgers, which means we have double-counted them. Therefore, to avoid double-counting, we subtract 6 from our final count.

9. **Final calculation**:
   9 (students who like neither) - 6 (students who like both) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 students who do not like either French fries or burgers.

We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to solve this problem. The total number of students who like either French fries or burgers or both is the sum of those who like French fries and those who like burgers, minus those who like both (to avoid double counting). Then we subtract this from the total number of students in the class.

Let's denote:
- $L_F$ as the number of students who like French fries, which is 15.
- $L_B$ as the number of students who like burgers, which is 10.
- $B$ as the number of students who like both French fries and burgers, which is 6.
- $C$ as the total number of students, which is 25.
- $R$ as the number of students who do not like either food.

From the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of students who like either French fries or burgers or both is:
\[ L_F + L_B - B = 15 + 10 - 6 = 19 \]

So, the number of students who like either French fries or burgers or both is 19. Therefore, the number of students who do not like either food is:
\[ C - (L_F + L_B - B) = 25 - 19 \]
\[ \text{R} = 25 - 19 = 6 \]

Hence, 6 students do not like either French fries or burgers.

To determine how many students do not like either food, we need to first find out how many students like either French fries or burgers or both. We are given that 15 students like French fries and 10 students like burgers, and 6 students like both.

The principle of inclusion and exclusion for two sets allows us to find the number of students who like either French fries or burgers or both. The formula is:

\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ |A \cup B| = 15 + 10 - 6 = 19 \]

This means 19 students like either French fries or burgers or both.

Since there are 25 students in total, the number of students who do not like either food is:

\[ 25 - |A \cup B| = 25 - 19 = 6 \]

However, this result includes students who like both French fries and burgers. So, we need to subtract the 6 students who like both from the 5 who like either food to get the correct number of students who do not like either food.

Therefore, the number of students who do not like either food is:

\[ 25 - |A \cup B| - 6 = 25 - 19 - 6 = 0 \]

This calculation seems incorrect because we must consider the possibility of students who do not like either food. Let's re-evaluate the calculation:

There are 19 students who like either French fries or burgers or both. Since 6 of these students like both, we subtract these 6 from 19 to find those who only like French fries or only like burgers:

\[ 19 - 6 = 13 \]

Thus, 13 students like either French fries or burgers. The number of students who do not like either food is:

\[ 25 - 13 = 12 \]

So, 12 students do not like either French fries or burgers.

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to determine the number of students who like either French fries or burgers, or both. Let's denote the following:

- $F$ as the set of students who like French fries.
- $B$ as the set of students who like burgers.

We know:
- The total number of students is 25.
- 15 students like French fries, so $|F| = 15$.
- 10 students like burgers, so $|B| = 10$.
- 6 students like both French fries and burgers, so $|F \cap B| = 6$.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of students who like either French fries or burgers (or both) is:
\[ |F \cup B| = |F| + |B| - |F \cap B| \]
\[ |F \cup B| = 15 + 10 - 6 = 29 \]

However, this calculation suggests that 29 students like either French fries or burgers, or both, which is more than the total number of students in the class (25). This indicates that there is an overlap in counting students who like both items, which means that some students are counted twice, i.e., they like both French fries and burgers.

The question does not specify the number of students who like neither French fries nor burgers, so we cannot determine it directly from the information provided. Therefore, we cannot accurately calculate the number of students who do not like either French fries nor burgers based on the given data.
