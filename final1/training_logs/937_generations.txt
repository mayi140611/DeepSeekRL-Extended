To determine how much Jean gives away to her grandchildren each year, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. Jean buys each grandchild 2 cards a year.
2. Each card contains $80.
3. There are 3 grandchildren.

First, we calculate the total number of cards Jean buys in a year:
\[ 3 \text{ grandchildren} \times 2 \text{ cards per grandchild} = 6 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money in these cards:
\[ 6 \text{ cards} \times 80 \text{ dollars per card} = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jean gives away $480 to her grandchildren each year.

Jean has 3 grandchildren. Each of them receives 2 cards per year. So, the total number of cards she gives away to her grandchildren is \( 3 \text{ grandchildren} \times 2 \text{ cards/grandchild/year} = 6 \text{ cards/year} \).

Each card contains $80. Therefore, the total amount of money Jean gives away to her grandchildren each year is \( 6 \text{ cards/year} \times 80 \text{ dollars/card} = 480 \text{ dollars/year} \).

To calculate the total amount Jean gives to her grandchildren in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of grandchildren Jean has.
2. Calculate how many cards each grandchild receives per year.
3. Compute the total number of cards Jean buys for all grandchildren.
4. Find out how much is put into each card.
5. Multiply the number of cards by the amount put into each card to get the total amount received.

Given:
- Jean has 3 grandchildren.
- She buys 2 cards per grandchild per year.
- Each card contains $80.

Firstly, calculate the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Total Cards} = \text{Number of Grandchildren} \times \text{Cards per Grandchild} \]
\[ \text{Total Cards} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, find the total amount in the cards:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Total Cards} \times \text{Amount per Card} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 6 \times 80 = 480 \]

Therefore, Jean gives away $480 to her grandchildren a year.

Jean has 3 grandchildren, and she buys each grandkid 2 cards a year. Each card contains $80. Therefore, the amount of money she gives to each grandkid is $80. Since she has 3 grandchildren, the total amount she gives to them is $80 * 3 = $240. To find out how much she gives away to her grandchildren a year, we simply take the total amount and multiply it by the number of grandchildren she has.

So, the total amount she gives to her grandchildren a year is $240 * 3 = $720.

Jean has 3 grandchildren. Each grandchild gets 2 cards a year, and she puts $80 in each card.

Let's first calculate the total amount she puts into cards for one grandchild per year:
\[ 2 \text{ cards} \times \$80 \text{ per card} = \$160 \text{ per grandchild per year} \]

Since Jean has 3 grandchildren, the total amount she gives away to grandchildren each year is:
\[ 3 \text{ grandchildren} \times \$160 \text{ per grandchild per year} = \$480 \text{ per year} \]

So, the total amount Jean gives away to grandchildren in a year is \$480.
