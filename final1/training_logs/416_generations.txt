180
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To calculate the total cost Jim paid for the package, we first need to determine the discounted price per car wash. Since he only has to pay 60%, we calculate 60% of the normal price of $15.

\[ \text{Discounted price per car wash} = 15 \times \frac{60}{100} = 15 \times 0.6 = 9 \]

Now, we need to find the total cost for 20 car washes at the discounted price of $9 per car wash:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 9 = 180 \]

Therefore, Jim paid $180 for the package.

Each car wash normally costs $15, and he bought 20 car washes. So, normally he would pay \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.

Since he only has to pay 60% of the normal cost, he has to pay \( 300 \times 0.6 = 180 \) dollars.

To determine how much Jim paid for the package, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 20 car washes without the discount.
2. Apply the 60% discount to the total cost.
3. Find the final amount Jim paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 20 car washes without the discount.
The normal cost for one car wash is $15. Therefore:
\[ 20 \text{ car washes} \times 15 \text{ dollars per car wash} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Apply the 60% discount to the total cost.
A 60% discount means Jim pays 40% of the total cost. So we need to calculate 40% of $300:
\[ 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Find the final amount Jim paid.
The final amount Jim paid is $120.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>
120 dollars
</answer>
<reasoning>
We calculated the total cost of 20 car washes without the discount, which is $300. Then we applied the 60% discount (which means we paid 40% of the total cost) to find that Jim paid $120.

To determine how much Jim paid for the package of car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the car washes without the discount.
2. Apply the 60% discount to the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost of 20 car washes without any discount. Since each car wash costs $15, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 60% discount. This means Jim only has to pay 60% of the total cost. To find out how much Jim actually paid, we multiply the total cost by 60% (or 0.60):
\[ 300 \times 0.60 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Jim paid for the package is:
\[ \boxed{180} \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Jim paid for the package of 20 car washes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car washes without the package discount.

A normal car wash costs $15, so 20 car washes would cost:
20 * $15 = $300

Jim only has to pay 60% of the normal price, so we need to find 60% of $300.
60% of $300 is calculated as:
0.60 * $300 = $180

Therefore, Jim paid $180 for the package of 20 car washes.

To find out how much Jim paid for the package, we first need to determine the cost per car wash after the discount. 

A car wash normally costs $15, and since Jim only has to pay 60% of the original price, we calculate the discount amount by:

\[ 15 \times 0.60 = 9 \]

Then, we subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much Jim pays per car wash:

\[ 15 - 9 = 6 \]

Jim buys 20 car washes, so the total cost for the package is:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jim paid $120 for the package.

To find out how much Jim paid for the package, we first need to determine the total cost of 20 car washes at the normal price, which is $15 each. Then we calculate 60% of this total cost to find out the amount he had to pay for the package.

Total cost of 20 car washes at $15 each: 20 * $15 = $300

60% of $300 is calculated as: 0.60 * $300 = $180

So, the answer is that Jim paid $180 for the package of 20 car washes.

First, we find the cost of a package of 20 car washes by multiplying the cost of one car wash by the number of car washes in the package: \(15 \times 20 = 300\).

Next, we calculate the discounted price of the package by finding 60% of the total cost: \(300 \times 0.60 = 180\).

So, the total amount Jim paid for the package is \(180\) dollars.
