Bekah initially had 408 pages to read and has already read 113 pages. This means she has \(408 - 113 = 295\) pages left to read. She has 5 days left to complete her reading. To find out how many pages she needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days: \(295 \div 5 = 59\).

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####


system
Bekah has to read a total of 408 pages. She has already read 113 pages. To find out how many pages she has left to read, we subtract the pages she has already read from the total pages:

\[ 408 - 113 = 295 \]

Bekah has 5 days left to read the remaining pages. To determine how many pages she needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

\[ 295 \div 5 = 59 \]

So, Bekah will need to read 59 pages each day for 5 days to finish her assignment.
