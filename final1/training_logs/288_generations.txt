###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

John decides to get gym memberships so he can get in shape.  The gym close to his house is close but doesn't have everything he wants so he gets two different gym memberships.  The cheap one costs $10 a month and has a sign-up fee of $50.  The second gym is 3 times more expensive and it has a sign-up fee of 4 months membership.  How much total did he pay in the first year for gym membership?

system
For the first gym, the total cost is simply the monthly fee plus the sign-up fee, which is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total cost for the first gym} = \$10 \text{ per month} \times 12 \text{ months} + \$50 \]

For the second gym, which is 3 times more expensive, the total monthly cost is \(3 \times \$10 = \$30\). It also has a sign-up fee of 4 months membership, which translates to \(4 \times \$10 = \$40\) for the first year's membership fee. The total cost for the second gym is then:
\[ \text{Total cost for the second gym} = (\$30 \times 12) + \$40 \]

Now, let's calculate both costs and add them to find the total amount John paid for gym memberships in the first year.

</reasoning>
<answer>
\[ \text{Total cost for the first gym} = \$10 \times 12 + \$50 = \$120 + \$50 = \$170 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for the second gym} = (\$30 \times 12) + \$40 = \$360 + \$40 = \$400 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for both gyms} = \$170 + \$400 = \$570 \]

The second gym is 3 * $10 = $30 more expensive than the cheap one.

So the second gym is a total of $10 + $30 = $40 a month.

For membership at the second gym, he pays $40 * 4 = $160 in upfront costs.

So for both gyms his total upfront costs are $50 + $160 = $210.

For these two gyms, he pays $160 + $50 = $166 in a year.

And for the cheap one, he pays 12 * $10 = $120 in a year.

So his total membership costs for 12 months are $50 + $166 + $120 = $336.

The first gym membership costs $10 a month, so for a year it would be $10 * 12 = $120.
The sign-up fee for the first gym is $50.

The second gym is 3 times more expensive, so it costs $10 * 3 = $30 a month.
The sign-up fee for the second gym is 4 months membership, so it would be $30 * 4 = $120.

The total cost for the first year for both gym memberships is $120 (for the first gym) + $50 (sign-up fee) + $120 (for the second gym) + $120 (sign-up fee) = $310.

The cost for the first gym membership without the sign-up fee is $10 per month. For the first year, the total cost of gym membership at this gym is:

\[10 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 120 \text{ dollars}\]

Adding the sign-up fee, the total cost for the first gym membership in the first year is:

\[120 \text{ dollars} + 50 \text{ dollars} = 170 \text{ dollars}\]

The second gym is 3 times more expensive, so its monthly rate is:

\[3 \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}\]

The sign-up fee for this gym is for 4 months, so it is:

\[4 \times 30 \text{ dollars} = 120 \text{ dollars}\]

For the first year, the total cost of gym membership at the second gym is:

\[30 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 360 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 480 \text{ dollars}\]

Adding the total cost of gym memberships from both gyms in the first year:

\[170 \text{ dollars} + 480 \text{ dollars} = 650 \text{ dollars}\]

The first gym membership costs $10 per month for 12 months and has a sign-up fee of $50, so the total cost for the first gym is $10 * 12 + $50 = $170.

The second gym is 3 times more expensive than the first gym, so it costs $10 * 3 = $30 per month. Since he is joining for a year, he will pay $30 * 12 = $360 for the second gym.

The total cost for both gym memberships for the first year is $170 + $360 = $530.

To find out the total amount John paid in the first year for gym memberships, we need to calculate the cost based on the given information.

1. **Cheap gym membership:**
   - Monthly cost: $10
   - Sign-up fee: $50
   - Total cost per month: $10 + $50 = $60
   - Number of months in a year: 12
   - Total cost for the first year: $60 * 12 = $720

2. **Expensive gym membership:**
   - Monthly cost: 3 times the cheap one, so 3 * $10 = $30
   - Sign-up fee: 4 months membership, so 4 * $30 = $120
   - Total cost per month: $30 + $120 = $150
   - Number of months in a year: 12
   - Total cost for the first year: $150 * 12 = $1,800

3. **Total cost for the first year:**
   - Adding the costs of both gym memberships: $720 (cheap) + $1,800 (expensive) = $2,520

There you have it! John paid a total of $2,520 in the first year for his gym memberships.

The monthly cost for the more expensive gym is 3 * $10 = $30.
The sign-up fee for the more expensive gym is 3 * $10 = $30.
The total cost for the first gym is $50 + $30 + $30 = $110 monthly.
The total cost for the first gym for one year is $110 * 12 = $1,320.

The monthly cost for the second gym is 3 * $10 = $30.
The sign-up fee for the second gym is 30 * 3 = $90 monthly.
The total cost for the second gym is $90 + $30 * 12 = $390 monthly.
The total cost for the second gym for one year is $390 * 12 = $4,680.

The cheap gym membership costs $10 a month for 12 months and has a sign-up fee of $50. The second gym membership is 3 times more expensive, so it costs $10 * 3 = $30 per month. The second gym membership also has a sign-up fee of 4 months of membership, which is $10 * 4 = $40. 

Total cost for the first year at the cheap gym is $10 * 12 + $50 = $170. Total cost for the first year at the second gym is $30 * 12 + $40 = $380.

Therefore, the total amount John paid in the first year for gym membership is $170 + $380 = $550.

First, we need to calculate the total cost for the first gym membership. The first gym costs $10 a month with a sign-up fee of $50. Therefore, the total cost for the first gym membership per year is:

\[ 10 \, \text{months/year} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 120 \, \text{dollars/year} \]
Adding the sign-up fee:
\[ 70 \, \text{dollars/year} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the second gym membership. The second gym is three times more expensive than the first, which means it costs \( 3 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 30 \, \text{dollars} \) per month. With a sign-up fee of 4 months membership, the total cost per year for the second gym is:

\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 360 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

And the sign-up fee:
\[ 360 \, \text{dollars/year} = 120 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs from both gyms to find the total amount John paid in the first year for gym membership:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/year (sign-up fee for first gym)} + 120 \, \text{dollars/year} + 360 \, \text{dollars/year} = 530 \, \text{dollars} \]

Let's calculate the total cost for each gym membership first.

For the first gym:
- Monthly cost: $10
- Sign-up fee: $50

For the second gym:
- Monthly cost: \(3 \times 10 = 30\) dollars
- Sign-up fee: \(4 \times 30 = 120\) dollars

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each gym over a year.

For the first gym:
- Monthly cost: $10 per month
- Total for 12 months: \(10 \times 12 = 120\) dollars

For the second gym:
- Monthly cost: $30 per month
- Total for 12 months: \(30 \times 12 = 360\) dollars

Adding the sign-up fees for both gyms:
- Sign-up fee for the first gym: $50
- Sign-up fee for the second gym: $120

Now, we add the total monthly costs and the sign-up fees together for both gyms:

Total for the first gym = $120 (for 12 months) + $50 (sign-up fee) = $170
Total for the second gym = $360 (for 12 months) + $120 (sign-up fee) = $480

Finally, we add these two totals together to get the overall total for both gyms:

Total for both gyms = $170 (first gym) + $480 (second gym) = $650

Therefore, the reasoning is based on calculating the total cost for each gym over a year, including both the monthly membership fees and the sign-up fees, and then summing these amounts to find the total cost for both gyms combined.

To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to sum up the monthly cost for both gym memberships and the respective sign-up fees. 

1. The first gym membership costs $10 a month with a sign-up fee of $50. For one year (12 months), the total for this gym would be:
   \(10 \times 12 + 50 = 120 + 50 = 170\) dollars.

2. The second gym membership is 3 times more expensive than the first, so it costs \(3 \times 10 = 30\) dollars a month, and has a sign-up fee of 4 months' membership. For one year, this would be:
   \(30 \times 12 + 30 \times 4 = 360 + 120 = 480\) dollars.

Adding these together gives the total cost for the first year:
\(170 + 480 = 650\) dollars.
