To find out how much money Salvadore and Santo earned together, we need to first determine how much Santo earned. Since Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned, we can calculate Santo's earnings by dividing Salvadore's earnings by 2.

Salvadore's earnings: $1956
Santo's earnings: $1956 / 2 = $978

Now, to find the total earnings of both men together, we add their individual earnings:

Total earnings: Salvadore's earnings + Santo's earnings
Total earnings: $1956 + $978 = $2934

Therefore, the total amount of money that Salvadore and Santo earned together is $2934.

To find out how much money Salvadore and Santo earned together, we first need to calculate how much Santo earned. Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned. So we calculate Santo's earnings as follows:

1. Salvadore's earnings: $1956
2. Santo's earnings: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1956 \)

Now, let's calculate how much Santo earned:

\( 1956 \div 2 = 978 \)

So, Santo earned $978.

Next, to find out how much the two men earned together, we add Salvadore's earnings to Santo's earnings:

\( 1956 + 978 = 2934 \)

Therefore, together Salvadore and Santo earned $2934.

To determine how much money both men earned together, we need to calculate how much Santo earned and then add it to Salvadore's earnings.

First, we know Salvadore earned $1956. Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned, so we calculate Santo's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Santo's earnings} = \frac{1956}{2} = 978 \]

Next, we add Salvadore's earnings to Santo's earnings to find the total amount earned by both:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 1956 + 978 = 2934 \]

Therefore, the two men earned a total of $2934 together.

Reasoning:
To find out how much money the two men earned together, we need to first determine how much Santo earned, and then add that to Salvadore's earnings.

Salvadore earned $1956.
Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned, so Santo's earnings = $1956 / 2 = $978.

The total amount of money earned by the two men together = Salvadore's earnings + Santo's earnings.
Therefore, the total earnings = $1956 + $978.

To find out how much money Salvadore and Santo earned together, we first need to calculate how much Santo earned. Since Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

Santo's earnings = 1/2 * Salvadore's earnings
Santo's earnings = 1/2 * 1956
Santo's earnings = 978

Now that we know both men earned their respective amounts, we can add them together to find the combined earnings:

Combined earnings = Salvadore's earnings + Santo's earnings
Combined earnings = 1956 + 978
Combined earnings = 2934

So, the two men earned a total of $2934 together.
