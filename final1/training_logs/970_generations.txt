First, we need to determine how many games John plays in. Since he plays in 80% of the 20 games, we calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Games played by John} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, we determine the number of fouls John gets in these 16 games. Since he gets fouled 5 times a game, we calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Total fouls} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \]

For each foul, John gets 2 free throws. Therefore, the total number of free throws he gets is:
\[ \text{Total free throws} = 80 \times 2 = 160 \]

First, we need to calculate the total number of games John plays in, which is 80% of 20 games:
\[0.8 \times 20 = 16\ \text{games}\]

Next, we determine the total number of fouls John gets, which is 5 fouls per game:
\[5 \times 16 = 80\ \text{fouls}\]

For every foul, John gets 2 free throws, so the total number of free throws he gets is:
\[80 \times 2 = 160\ \text{free throws}\]

Now we calculate the percentage of his free throws he makes. Since he makes 70% of his free throws, this amount is:
\[0.7 \times 160 = 112\ \text{made free throws}\]

Therefore, John gets 160 free throws, with 112 made.

To determine the total number of free throws John gets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total games played**: John plays in 80% of the 20 games the team plays.
   \[
   \text{Total games} = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \text{ games}
   \]

2. **Calculate fouls taken**: John gets fouled 5 times per game.
   \[
   \text{Total fouls} = 5 \text{ fouls/game} \times 16 \text{ games} = 80 \text{ fouls}
   \]

3. **Calculate free throw opportunities**: For each foul, John gets 2 shots.
   \[
   \text{Total free throws} = 2 \text{ shots/foul} \times 80 \text{ fouls} = 160 \text{ free throws}
   \]

Therefore, John gets a total of 160 free throws.

First, determine the total number of games John participates in. Given that he plays in 80% of the 20 games, we calculate:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \text{ games} \]

Next, calculate the total number of fouls John receives. With 5 fouls per game, the total number of fouls is:
\[ 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ fouls} \]

For each foul, John gets 2 free throws. Therefore, the total number of free throws he gets is:
\[ 80 \times 2 = 160 \]

So John gets 160 free throws in the 16 games that he plays.

John plays in 80% of the 20 games, so he plays in \(0.8 \times 20 = 16\) games. For each game, he gets 5 fouls, so in total he gets \(16 \times 5 = 80\) fouls. Each foul gives him 2 free throw shots, so he gets \(80 \times 2 = 160\) free throws in total.

On top of these, he hits 70% of his free throws, meaning for every 100 shots, he makes 70 of them. So out of the 160 free throws, he makes \(0.7 \times 160 = 112\) free throws.

Therefore, the total number of free throws he gets is \(112 + 160 = 272\).

First, let's find out the total number of games John participates in. This is 80% of the 20 games the team plays, so:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \text{ games} \]

Next, since John is fouled 5 times a game, and he participates in 16 games, the total number of free throws he attempts is:
\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ free throws} \]

However, we are only interested in the free throws he hits, which is 70% of his total free throws. Therefore, the number of free throws he makes is:
\[ 0.70 \times 80 = 56 \text{ free throws} \]

So, John makes 56 free throws.

To determine how many free throws John gets, we'll break down the problem into steps.

First, calculate the total number of games John plays:
\[ 20 \text{ games} \times 80\% = 20 \times 0.8 = 16 \text{ games} \]

Next, determine how many of these games John plays:
\[ 16 \text{ games} \times 50\% = 16 \times 0.5 = 8 \text{ games} \]

Now, calculate the total number of free throw attempts in these games:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times (70\% \times 2 \text{ shots/game}) = 8 \times (0.7 \times 2) = 8 \times 1.4 = 11.2 \text{ free throw attempts} \]

The number of free throws John makes is based on his shooting percentage. Since he hits 70% of his free throws:
\[ 11.2 \text{ free throw attempts} \times 70\% = 11.2 \times 0.7 = 7.84 \text{ free throws} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, John makes 8 free throws.
