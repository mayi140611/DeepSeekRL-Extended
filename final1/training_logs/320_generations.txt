system
To find out how much Austin started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the robots:
   \[
   7 \text{ robots} \times \$8.75 \text{ per robot} = \$61.25
   \]

2. Add the total tax:
   \[
   \$61.25 + \$7.22 = \$68.47
   \]

3. Add the change Austin left with:
   \[
   \$68.47 + \$11.53 = \$80.00
   \]

So, Austin started with $80.00.

To find out how much Austin started with, we need to calculate the total cost of the robots and add the tax and the change he brought home.

Cost of one robot: $8.75
Number of friends: 7

Total cost for 7 robots: 7 * $8.75 = $61.25

Cost of tax: $7.22

Change left: $11.53

Total amount left: $11.53

Total amount Austin should have: Total cost for robots + Cost of tax + Change left

Total amount Austin should have = $61.25 + $7.22 + $11.53 = $79.90

Therefore, Austin started with $79.90.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total cost of the robots:
   - Each robot costs $8.75
   - Austin bought for 7 friends
   - Total cost of robots = $8.75 * 7

2. Add the tax to the total cost of the robots:
   - Tax = $7.22
   - Total with tax = $8.75 * 7 + $7.22

3. Add the amount of change Austin left with:
   - Change = $11.53
   - Amount Austin started with = Total with tax + Change

Now let's do the calculations:

1. Total cost of robots = $8.75 * 7 = $61.25

2. Total with tax = $61.25 + $7.22 = $68.47

3. Amount Austin started with = $68.47 + $11.53 = $79.99

<answer>
79.99
</answer>
<reasoning>
To determine how much Austin started with, we first calculated the total cost of the robots and then added the tax to find the total amount he paid. After that, we added the amount of change he left with to find out how much he started with in his original amount.

Let's break this down:

1. Each robot costs $8.75 and he bought robots for 7 friends, so the cost for the robots alone is \(7 \times 8.75 = 61.25\).

2. There was a tax of $7.22 charged.

3. Austin left with $11.53 in change after paying for the robots and tax.

4. To find out how much he started with, we sum up the cost of the robots, the tax, and the change he left with.

5. So, the amount Austin started with is \(61.25 + 7.22 + 11.53\).

6. Calculating this: \(61.25 + 7.22 + 11.53 = 80.00\).

Therefore, Austin started with $80.00.

Austin bought 7 robots at $8.75 each and was charged $7.22 for tax. The total cost of the robots before tax was:

7 robots * $8.75/robot = $61.25

Adding the tax cost:

$61.25 (cost of robots) + $7.22 (tax) = $68.47 (total cost)

He left with $11.53 in change.

Therefore, the amount Austin started with is the total cost plus the change he left with:

$68.47 (total cost) + $11.53 (change) = $80.00

Let's calculate the total cost of the robots first. Each robot costs $8.75 and there are 7 friends, so the cost for the robots is:
\[ 7 \times 8.75 = 61.25 \]

Next, we add the tax to the cost of the robots:
\[ 61.25 + 7.22 = 68.47 \]

Now we know that after buying the robots and paying the tax, Austin left with $11.53 in change. This means that the amount he started with was the total cost of the robots plus the change he left with:
\[ 68.47 + 11.53 = 80 \]

So, Austin started with $80.

To find out how much Austin started with, we need to calculate the total cost of the robots and the tax, and then add the change he left with.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the robots:**
   - Each robot costs $8.75.
   - Austin bought seven robots.
   - Total cost of robots = \(7 \times 8.75\).

2. **Calculate the total cost including tax:**
   - The tax is $7.22.
   - Total cost including tax = Total cost of robots + Tax.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Austin started with:**
   - We know the change he left with, which is $11.53.
   - Total amount he started with = Total cost including tax + Change left with.

Let's do the calculations step by step.

#### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the robots

Total cost of robots = \(7 \times 8.75 = 61.25\) dollars.

#### Step 2: Calculate the total cost including tax

Total cost including tax = \(61.25 + 7.22 = 68.47\) dollars.

#### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Austin started with

Total amount started with = Total cost including tax + Change left with = \(68.47 + 11.53 = 80.00\) dollars.

So, Austin started with $80.00.

Austin gave each of his seven friends a robot and was charged $7.22 in tax. Therefore, for 7 robots, it would be 7 * $8.75 = $61.25 (cost of the robots). Including the tax, the total cost would be $61.25 + $7.22 = $68.47.

Austin left with $11.53 in change. Subtracting the total cost from this amount tells us how much Austin started with: $68.47 - $11.53 = $56.94.

To determine how much Austin started with, we need to calculate the total cost of the robots and the tax, and then add the leftover change.

First, we calculate the total cost of the seven robots:
\[ 7 \times 8.75 = 61.25 \]
This is the cost before tax. Adding the tax:
\[ 61.25 + 7.22 = 68.47 \]
This is the total amount Austin spent.

Next, we know that after paying for the robots, he had $11.53 in change. Therefore, the amount he started with is the total amount spent plus the change:
