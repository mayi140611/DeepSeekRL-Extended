Let's denote the cost of each of the two other puppies as \( x \).

First, we know the cost of the three puppies on sale is \( 3 \times 150 \) dollars.

The total cost for all five puppies is $800.

Putting it all together, we have the equation:

\[ 3 \times 150 + 2x = 800 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 450 + 2x = 800 \]
\[ 2x = 800 - 450 \]
\[ 2x = 350 \]
\[ x = \frac{350}{2} \]
\[ x = 175 \]

So, each of the two other puppies costs $175.

Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of the three puppies that are on sale. Since each of these three puppies costs $150, we can calculate the total cost of these puppies as follows:

\[ 3 \times 150 = 450 \]

Now we know the total cost of the sale puppies is $450. Next, we need to find out how much money is left for the two other puppies. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the sale puppies from the total cost of all five puppies:

\[ 800 - 450 = 350 \]

So, the two other puppies together cost $350. Since they cost the same, we can divide this total cost by 2 to find the cost of one puppy:

\[ \frac{350}{2} = 175 \]

Therefore, each of the two other puppies costs $175.

Each of the three puppies that are on sale for $150 each costs $150. To find the total cost of these three puppies, we multiply the cost of one puppy by the number of puppies, which is $150/puppy * 3 puppies = $450. The total cost of all five puppies is $800. To find the total cost of the other two puppies (which cost the same amount), we subtract the total cost of the three on-sale puppies from the total cost of the five puppies, which is $800 - $450 = $350. The cost of the other two puppies is split equally between them, which means each of them costs $350 / 2 = $175.

The total cost for the three puppies on sale is \(3 \times 150 = 450\).

If the total cost for all five puppies was $800, then the cost for the two other puppies is \(800 - 450 = 350\).

Since these two other puppies cost the same, each costs \(350 \div 2 = 175\).

Let's denote the cost of the two other puppies as \( x \).

Since three puppies are on sale for $150 each, the total cost for these three puppies is \( 3 \times 150 = \$450 \).

The total cost for all five puppies is $800, so the cost for the two other puppies is \( 800 - 450 = \$350 \).

Since these two other puppies cost the same, their cost is \( \frac{350}{2} = \$175 \) each.

Let's denote the cost of each of the two other puppies as \( x \). Since three puppies are on sale for $150 each, the total cost for these three puppies is \( 3 \times 150 = 450 \) dollars. Let the total cost of the other two puppies be \( 2x \). The total cost of all five puppies is $800. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 450 + 2x = 800 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we first subtract 450 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 800 - 450 \]
\[ 2x = 350 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{350}{2} \]
\[ x = 175 \]

So, each of the two other puppies costs $175.

Let's calculate the total cost of the three puppies on sale:
3 puppies * $150/puppy = $450

Now, let's subtract this amount from the total cost to find out how much the two other puppies cost in total:
$800 (total cost) - $450 (total cost of three puppies) = $350

Since these two puppies cost the same, we divide the total cost by 2:
$350 / 2 = $175

Therefore, each of those two other puppies cost $175.
