Clara starts with 100 stickers. She gives 10 stickers to a boy she likes, leaving her with:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ stickers} \]

Next, she gives half of the remaining stickers to her best friends. Half of 90 stickers is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ stickers} \]

After giving stickers to her best friends, Clara has:
\[ 90 - 45 = 45 \text{ stickers} \]

So, Clara has 45 stickers left.
