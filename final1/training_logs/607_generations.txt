#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Given that Li is 12 years old and Zhang is twice as old as Li, we calculate Zhang's age as follows:

\[ \text{Zhang's age} = 2 \times \text{Li's age} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Jung is 2 years older than Zhang. So, we calculate Jung's age as:

\[ \text{Jung's age} = \text{Zhang's age} + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Jung is 26 years old.

system
To find out how old Jung is, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Zhang's age based on the fact that Zhang is twice as old as Li.
2. Use Zhang's age to find Jung's age, knowing that Jung is 2 years older than Zhang.

Step 1: Zhang is twice as old as Li.
Li's age is 12 years.

Zhang's age = 2 * Li's age
Zhang's age = 2 * 12
Zhang's age = 24 years

Step 2: Jung is 2 years older than Zhang.
Jung's age = Zhang's age + 2

Jung's age = 24 + 2
Jung's age = 26 years

Therefore, Jung is 26 years old.

Zhang is twice as old as Li, who is 12 years old.
So, Zhang's age = 2 * 12 = 24 years.

Jung is 2 years older than Zhang.
So, Jung's age = 24 + 2 = 26 years.

Thus, Jung is 26 years old.

To find Jung's age, we can start by identifying Zhang's age based on the given information.

Given that Zhang is twice as old as Li and Li is 12 years old, we can calculate Zhang's age as follows:
\[ \text{Zhang's age} = 2 \times \text{Li's age} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Jung is 2 years older than Zhang. Therefore, Jung's age is:
\[ \text{Jung's age} = \text{Zhang's age} + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \text{ years old} \]

So, Jung is 26 years old.

Let's start by determining Zhang's age.

Given:
- Li is 12 years old.
- Zhang is twice as old as Li.
\[ \text{Zhang's age} = 2 \times \text{Li's age} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out Jung's age.

Given:
- Jung is 2 years older than Zhang.
\[ \text{Jung's age} = \text{Zhang's age} + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \text{ years old} \]

So, Jung is 26 years old.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Zhang is twice as old as Li.
2. Li is 12 years old.
3. Jung is 2 years older than Zhang.

First, we calculate Zhang's age:
\[ \text{Zhang's age} = 2 \times \text{Li's age} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years} \]

Next, we calculate Jung's age by adding 2 years to Zhang's age:
\[ \text{Jung's age} = \text{Zhang's age} + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \text{ years} \]

So, Jung is 26 years old.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####


system
To find Jung's age, we need to first determine Zhang's age based on the information given.

Given:
- Li is 12 years old.
- Zhang is twice as old as Li.

So, Zhang's age = 2 * Li's age
         = 2 * 12
         = 24 years old

Now that we know Zhang's age, we can determine Jung's age.

Given:
- Jung is 2 years older than Zhang.

So, Jung's age = Zhang's age + 2
             = 24 + 2
             = 26 years old

Therefore, Jung is 26 years old.
