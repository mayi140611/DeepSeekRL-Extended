To find the number of gigabytes still available on the USB drive, we need to calculate 50% of the total capacity first. 

Given:
- Total capacity of the USB drive = 16 GB
- 50% of the capacity is already busy

First, calculate 50% of 16 GB:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 16 \text{ GB} = 0.50 \times 16 \text{ GB} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

This means 8 GB of the USB drive is already occupied. To find the number of gigabytes still available, subtract the occupied space from the total capacity:
\[ \text{Available space} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Occupied space} = 16 \text{ GB} - 8 \text{ GB} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

To determine the number of gigabytes still available on the USB drive after 50% is already busy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total capacity of the USB drive: 16 gigabytes.
2. Determine how much space is currently occupied: 50% of 16 gigabytes.
3. Subtract the occupied space from the total capacity to find the remaining available space.

Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the USB drive.
\[ \text{Total capacity} = 16 \text{ GB} \]

Step 2: Calculate the occupied space (50% of the total capacity).
\[ \text{Occupied space} = 0.50 \times 16 \text{ GB} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

Step 3: Subtract the occupied space from the total capacity to find the remaining available space.
\[ \text{Available space} = 16 \text{ GB} - 8 \text{ GB} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

Thus, the number of gigabytes still available is 8.

To find out how many gigabytes are still available on a 16 GB USB drive where 50% is already busy, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the amount of space that is busy. Since 50% is already used, the space that is busy is \(50\% \times 16\) GB.
2. Then, subtract the busy space from the total capacity of the USB drive to find out how much space is still available.

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ \text{Busy space} = 0.50 \times 16 \text{ GB} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

\[ \text{Available space} = \text{Total space} - \text{Busy space} = 16 \text{ GB} - 8 \text{ GB} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

So, the number of gigabytes still available is 8 GB.

To determine the number of gigabytes still available on the USB drive, we need to first find out the total amount of space already used, and then subtract this from the total capacity of the USB drive.

1. The USB drive has a total capacity of 16 GB.
2. It's given that 50% of this capacity is already used.
3. To calculate the used space, we multiply the total capacity by 50% (which is the same as 0.5):
   \[
   \text{Used space} = 16 \text{ GB} \times 0.5 = 8 \text{ GB}
   \]
4. The number of gigabytes still available is then the total capacity minus the used space:
   \[
   \text{Available space} = 16 \text{ GB} - 8 \text{ GB} = 8 \text{ GB}
   \]

To calculate the number of gigabytes still available, we first need to determine how much space is already taken up on the USB drive, and then subtract that from the total capacity.

1. Calculate how much space is taken up by already busy data in the USB drive:
   50% of 16 GB = 0.50 * 16 GB = 8 GB

2. Subtract the space taken up by the busy data from the total capacity:
   Total capacity - Busy data = 16 GB - 8 GB = 8 GB

So, there are 8 gigabytes still available on the USB drive.

To determine the available space on the USB drive, we first need to calculate how much space is currently in use. Since 50% of the 16 GB capacity is already busy, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Busy space} = 16 \, \text{GB} \times 50\% = 16 \, \text{GB} \times 0.5 = 8 \, \text{GB} \]

The total capacity of the USB drive is 16 GB, so the usable space (available space) is:

\[ \text{Available space} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Busy space} = 16 \, \text{GB} - 8 \, \text{GB} = 8 \, \text{GB} \]

The USB drive has a total capacity of 16 GB. 50% of this is busy, which means 0.50 * 16 = 8 GB is in use. To find out how much space is still available, we subtract the used space from the total capacity: 16 - 8 = 8 GB. Therefore, 8 GB of the USB drive is still available.

To determine the number of gigabytes still available on a 16 GB USB drive where 50% is already busy, we first need to find out how much space is occupied by the 50%.

We know the total capacity is 16 GB, and 50% of it is occupied. First, calculate 50% of the total capacity:

\[ \text{Occupied space} = \frac{50}{100} \times 16 \text{ GB} = 0.5 \times 16 \text{ GB} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

So, 8 GB is already occupied. To find the space still available, subtract the occupied space from the total capacity:

\[ \text{Available space} = 16 \text{ GB} - 8 \text{ GB} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

Thus, there are 8 gigabytes still available on the USB drive.

To find the number of gigabytes still available on the USB drive, we first need to calculate the total amount of space used and then subtract this from the total capacity of the drive.

The USB drive has a total capacity of 16 GB. Since 50% of the drive is already busy, the space used is 50% of 16 GB.

The calculation for the space used is:
\[ \text{Space used} = 16 \text{ GB} \times \frac{50}{100} \]

\[ \text{Space used} = 16 \text{ GB} \times 0.50 \]

\[ \text{Space used} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

The number of gigabytes still available is the total capacity minus the space used:
\[ \text{Available space} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Space used} \]

\[ \text{Available space} = 16 \text{ GB} - 8 \text{ GB} \]

\[ \text{Available space} = 8 \text{ GB} \]

So, 8 gigabytes of space is still available on the USB drive.

To find the number of gigabytes still available on the USB drive, we first need to determine the amount of space that is already busy, which is 50% of the total capacity. Once we know this, we can subtract it from the total capacity to find out how much space is still available.

Since the total capacity of the USB drive is 16 GB, 50% of this capacity is \(16 \times 0.5 = 8\) GB. If 8 GB is already busy, then the number of gigabytes still available is \(16 - 8 = 8\) GB.

To calculate the number of gigabytes still available on a 16 GB USB drive where 50% is already busy, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of space already used:
   The USB drive is 16 GB in total and 50% of it is busy.
   50% of 16 GB is \( \frac{50}{100} \times 16 \) GB.
   \( \frac{50}{100} \times 16 = 0.5 \times 16 = 8 \) GB.

2. Subtract the used space from the total capacity to find the available space:
   Total capacity = 16 GB
   Used space = 8 GB
   Available space = Total capacity - Used space
   Available space = 16 GB - 8 GB = 8 GB.

So, the number of gigabytes still available is **8 GB**.
