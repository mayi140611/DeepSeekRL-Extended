system
Jennifer initially purchased 40 cans of milk. For every 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought an additional 6 cans. Since Mark purchased 50 cans, we need to calculate how many sets of 5 cans there are in Mark's purchase.

To find how many sets of 5 cans Mark has, we divide 50 by 5:
\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]

For each set of 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans. So for 10 sets, the additional cans Jennifer bought would be:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

Now, we add the additional cans she bought to the initial 40 cans she purchased:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, Jennifer brought home 100 cans of milk from the store.

Jennifer initially purchased 40 cans of milk. For every 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans.

First, calculate how many sets of 5 cans Mark bought:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ cans}}{5 \text{ cans/set}} = 10 \text{ sets} \]

Since Jennifer buys 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark buys:
\[ 6 \text{ cans/set} \times 10 \text{ sets} = 60 \text{ cans} \]

In total, Jennifer bought:
\[ 40 \text{ initial cans} + 60 \text{ additional cans} = 100 \text{ cans} \]

Therefore, Jennifer brought home 100 cans of milk from the store.

To determine how many additional cans Jennifer bought for every 5 cans Mark bought, we first need to find out how many sets of 5 cans Mark bought. Mark bought 50 cans, so we divide 50 by 5:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]

This means Mark bought 10 sets of 5 cans. Since Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought, we multiply the number of sets by 6:

\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

Jennifer originally bought 40 cans, and she bought an additional 60 cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. Adding these together gives us the total number of additional cans Jennifer bought:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Finally, we add the cans Jennifer originally bought to the cans she bought additionally:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

So, Jennifer brought home a total of 140 cans of milk from the store.

Let's first determine how many additional cans of milk Jennifer bought for Mark. According to the problem, for every 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans. Since Mark bought 50 cans, we can calculate how many sets of 5 cans that is:

\( \frac{50}{5} = 10 \)

So for 10 sets of 5 cans, Jennifer bought:

\( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) additional cans of milk.

Jennifer originally bought 40 cans, and she bought 60 additional cans for Mark. Therefore, the total number of cans Jennifer bought is:

\( 40 + 60 = 100 \) cans.

Now, we need to calculate how many cans Mark bought. Since the problem states that Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought and Mark bought 50 cans, we can use the following ratio to find out how many cans Jennifer bought for Mark:

\( \frac{\text{Jennifer's additional cans}}{\text{Mark's cans}} = \frac{60}{50} \)

Let \( x = \text{Jennifer's cans for Mark} \). Then we have:

\( \frac{x}{50} = \frac{60}{50} \)

Solving for \( x \), we get:

\( x = 60 \)

So, Jennifer bought 60 cans of milk for Mark. Adding this to the original 40 cans Jennifer bought, we have:

\( 40 + 60 = 100 \) cans.

Therefore, Jennifer brought home 100 cans of milk from the store.

To find out how many cans of milk Jennifer brought home, we need to first figure out how many additional cans she bought for Mark. As per the given condition, for every 5 cans of milk Mark bought, Jennifer bought 6 cans. Since Mark bought 50 cans, Jennifer bought:

50 cans of Mark × (6 extra cans of Jennifer for every 5 cans of Mark) = 50 × 6 = 300 cans of Jennifer.

Now we add Jennifer's original 40 cans to the 300 cans she bought for Mark:

Jennifer's total cans = Jennifer's original cans + Numbers of cans bought for Mark 
= 40 cans + 300 cans 
= 340 cans.

Therefore, the answer is 340.

Jennifer purchased 40 cans of milk initially. Then she bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. Since Mark bought 50 cans, we can calculate how many additional cans Jennifer bought based on the ratio:

\[ \text{Additional cans} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ cans}}{5 \text{ cans}} \right) \times 50 \text{ cans} \]
\[ \text{Additional cans} = 2 \times 50 \text{ cans} \]
\[ \text{Additional cans} = 100 \text{ cans} \]

Now, to find the total number of cans Jennifer brought home, we add the initial 40 cans to the additional 100 cans:

\[ \text{Total cans} = 40 \text{ cans} + 100 \text{ cans} \]
\[ \text{Total cans} = 140 \text{ cans} \]

Therefore, Jennifer brought home 140 cans of milk from the store.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jennifer initially purchased 40 cans of milk.
2. For every 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans.
3. Mark purchased 50 cans of milk.

First, let's calculate how many sets of 5 cans Mark bought:
\[ \text{Number of sets of 5 cans} = \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]

Next, for each set of 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans. Therefore, the total number of additional cans Jennifer bought is:
\[ \text{Additional cans} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

Now, let's add the initial 40 cans Jennifer purchased to the additional cans she bought:
\[ \text{Total cans Jennifer bought} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

So, Jennifer brought home 100 cans of milk from the store.

To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many additional cans of milk Jennifer bought. Since Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought, and Mark purchased 50 cans, we can calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Number of additional cans Jennifer bought} = \left(\frac{6}{5}\right) \times 50
\]

\[
= \left(\frac{6}{5}\right) \times 50
\]

Now, let's calculate this further:

\[
= 6 \times 10
\]

\[
= 60
\]

So, Jennifer bought an additional 60 cans of milk because of Mark's purchase.

Next, to find out the total number of cans Jennifer brought home, we add the original 40 cans she initially purchased to the additional 60 cans:

\[
\text{Total cans} = 40 + 60
\]

\[
= 100
\]

Therefore, Jennifer brought 100 cans of milk home from the store.

To determine how many cans of milk Jennifer brought home, we need to calculate the number of additional cans she bought based on Mark's purchase.

First, we find out how many sets of 5 cans Mark bought:
\[
\frac{50 \text{ cans}}{5 \text{ cans/set}} = 10 \text{ sets}
\]
Since Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought, we multiply the number of sets by 6:
\[
10 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ cans/set} = 60 \text{ cans}
\]
Now, we add the additional cans to the original purchase:
\[
40 \text{ cans} + 60 \text{ cans} = 100 \text{ cans}

Thus, Jennifer brought home a total of:

To find out how many cans Jennifer brought home, we need to first determine how many additional cans she bought for every 5 cans Mark bought.

Since Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought, and Mark bought 50 cans, we can set up a proportion:

\( \frac{6 \text{ cans}}{5 \text{ cans}} = \frac{x + 50 \text{ cans}}{50 \text{ cans}} \)

Solve for \( x \):

\( x + 50 = \frac{6}{5} \times 50 \)

\( x + 50 = 60 \)

\( x = 60 - 50 \)

\( x = 10 \)

So Jennifer bought 10 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. Since Mark bought 50 cans, Jennifer would have bought:

\( 10 \text{ cans} \times 5 \text{ times} \)

\( = 50 + 10 \)

\( = 60 \text{ cans} \)

Jennifer originally bought 40 cans, so she brought home:

\( 40 + 60 \)

\( = 100 \text{ cans} \)

Therefore, Jennifer brought home 100 cans of milk from the store.
