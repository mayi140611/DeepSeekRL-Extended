To determine the total cost Jerry needs to spend on cartridges, we first need to calculate the cost of the black-and-white cartridge and the three color cartridges individually, and then sum these costs.

1. Cost of the black-and-white cartridge:
   Price = $27

2. Cost of one color cartridge:
   Price = $32

3. Number of color cartridges:
   Number = 3

4. Total cost for all color cartridges:
   Total cost = Price per color cartridge × Number of color cartridges
               = $32 × 3
               = $96

5. Total cost for all cartridges:
   Total cost = Cost of black-and-white cartridge + Total cost for color cartridges
              = $27 + $96
              = $123

Therefore, the total amount Jerry will pay is $123.

To determine the total cost of the cartridges Jerry needs to add to his printer, we need to calculate the cost for the black-and-white cartridge and the three color cartridges separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, calculate the cost for the black-and-white cartridge:
- Cost per black-and-white cartridge = $27
- Jerry needs one black-and-white cartridge
- Therefore, the cost for the black-and-white cartridge is $27.

Next, calculate the cost for the three color cartridges:
- Cost per color cartridge = $32
- Jerry needs three color cartridges
- Therefore, the total cost for the color cartridges is \(32 \times 3 = 96\).

Now, sum the costs of the black-and-white and color cartridges to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of black-and-white cartridge + Cost of color cartridges
- Total cost = $27 + $96 = $123.

So, Jerry pays a total of $123 for the cartridges.

To find the total cost Jerry needs to pay for the printer cartridges, we first need to calculate the cost of the black-and-white cartridge and the total cost of the color cartridges. 

The cost of the black-and-white cartridge is $27. Each color cartridge costs $32, and Jerry needs three color cartridges, so the total cost for the color cartridges is \(3 \times 32 = $96\).

Now, we add the cost of the black-and-white cartridge and the total cost of the color cartridges to find the total cost Jerry needs to pay:
\[27 + 96 = 123\]

Therefore, Jerry pays a total of $123.

We start by calculating the cost of the color cartridges. Since each color cartridge costs $32 and Jerry needs three color cartridges, the total cost for the color cartridges is $32 \times 3 = $96.

Next, we calculate the cost of the black-and-white cartridge. Since each black-and-white cartridge costs $27, the cost for one black-and-white cartridge is $27.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the color cartridges and the black-and-white cartridge together: $96 + $27 = $123.

Therefore, Jerry pays a total of $123 to get the printer to work.

To calculate the total cost Jerry needs to add on the printer, we need to know how many of each type of cartridge he needs and their respective costs.

Each color cartridge costs $32, and Jerry needs three of them.
Each black-and-white cartridge costs $27, and Jerry needs one of them.

First, we calculate the total cost for the color cartridges:
\[ 3 \, \text{cartridges} \times \$32 \, \text{per cartridge} = \$96 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the black-and-white cartridge:
\[ 1 \, \text{cartridge} \times \$27 \, \text{per cartridge} = \$27 \]

Now, we add the cost of the color cartridges and the black-and-white cartridge to find the total amount Jerry will pay:
\[ \$96 + \$27 = \$123 \]

Therefore, Jerry will pay a total of $123 for the cartridges.

To determine the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the color cartridges and the black-and-white cartridge separately, and then add them together.

1. **Cost of color cartridges**: There are three color cartridges at $32 each.
   \[
   3 \times 32 = 96
   \]

2. **Cost of the black-and-white cartridge**: This is $27.

3. **Total cost**: We add the cost of the color cartridges to the cost of the black-and-white cartridge.
   \[
   96 + 27 = 123

To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the price of each type of cartridge by the number of cartridges Jerry needs to buy and then add the totals for each type of cartridge.

1. Black-and-white cartridge: $27
2. Color cartridges: $32 each, and Jerry needs 3 of them, so we calculate $32 * 3 = $96

Now, we sum the costs of the black-and-white cartridge and the color cartridges:

Total cost = Black-and-white cartridge cost + Color cartridge cost
Total cost = $27 + $96
Total cost = $123

Therefore, Jerry pays a total of $123.

To calculate the total cost Jerry needs to spend for the printer cartridges, we need to consider the costs of both the black-and-white cartridge and the three color cartridges.

First, we calculate the cost of the color cartridges. Since each color cartridge costs $32 and Jerry needs three, we multiply the cost of one color cartridge by three:
\[32 \times 3 = 96\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the black-and-white cartridge. Each black-and-white cartridge costs $27. So, for one black-and-white cartridge, the cost is:
\[27\]

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the color cartridges to the cost of the black-and-white cartridge:
\[96 + 27 = 123\]

Therefore, Jerry pays a total of $123 for the printer cartridges.

To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the three color cartridges and then add the cost of the black-and-white cartridge.

The cost of a color cartridge is $32.
Since there are three color cartridges, the total cost for the color cartridges is \(3 \times 32 = 96\) dollars.

The cost of a black-and-white cartridge is $27.

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total cost:
\[96 + 27 = 123\]

Therefore, Jerry pays $123 in total.
