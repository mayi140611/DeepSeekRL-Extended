system
To find the total number of bricks Libby used, we first need to determine how many rows are in the bottom half and in the top half. Since she uses a total of 10 rows, there are 5 rows in the bottom half and 5 rows in the top half.

For the bottom half:
- The number of bricks in each row is 12.
- Since the bottom half of the igloo has 5 rows, the total number of bricks in the bottom half is \(12 \times 5 = 60\).

For the top half:
- The number of bricks in each row is 8.
- Since the top half of the igloo also has 5 rows, the total number of bricks in the top half is \(8 \times 5 = 40\).

Now, to find the total number of bricks used, we sum the bricks from the bottom half and the top half:
\[60 + 40 = 100\]

Therefore, Libby used 100 bricks of snow for her igloo.

To find the total number of bricks Libby used, we need to consider the configuration of the igloo. There are 10 rows in total, which can be divided into 5 rows in the bottom half and 5 rows in the top half.

1. Calculate the total number of bricks in the bottom half:
   \[
   \text{Bottom half total} = 5 \times 12 = 60
   \]
   
2. Calculate the total number of bricks in the top half:
   \[
   \text{Top half total} = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

3. Add the totals from the bottom and top halves to find the overall total:
   \[
   \text{Total bricks} = \text{Bottom half total} + \text{Top half total} = 60 + 40 = 100

To find the total number of bricks Libby used for her igloo, we need to calculate the number of bricks in the bottom half and the number of bricks in the top half separately, and then add them together.

The bottom half of the igloo has 12 bricks in each row, and there are 5 rows in the bottom half (since \(10 / 2 = 5\)). So, the total number of bricks in the bottom half is:
\[12 \text{ bricks/row} \times 5 \text{ rows} = 60 \text{ bricks}\]

The top half of the igloo has 8 bricks in each row, and there are also 5 rows in the top half (since \(10 / 2 = 5\)). So, the total number of bricks in the top half is:
\[8 \text{ bricks/row} \times 5 \text{ rows} = 40 \text{ bricks}\]

The total number of bricks used for the entire igloo is the sum of the bricks from the bottom half and the top half:
\[60 \text{ bricks} + 40 \text{ bricks} = 100 \text{ bricks}\]

Therefore, Libby used 100 bricks of snow for her igloo.

To find out how many bricks Libby used, we need to break the igloo into its two halves and then add the number of bricks in each half.

The igloo has 10 rows divided into two halves: the bottom half and the top half. Since 10 is an even number, each half has 5 rows.

For the bottom half, the number of bricks per row is 12. Therefore, for 5 rows, the total number of bricks in the bottom half is \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \).

For the top half, the number of bricks per row is 8. Therefore, for 5 rows, the total number of bricks in the top half is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \).

Adding the bricks from both halves gives the total number of bricks:
\[ 60 \text{ (bottom half)} + 40 \text{ (top half)} = 100 \text{ bricks}. \]

Therefore, Libby used a total of 100 bricks of snow for her igloo.

To determine the total number of bricks Libby used for her igloo, we need to calculate the number of bricks in the bottom half and the top half separately, and then add them together.

1. **Calculate the number of bricks in the bottom half:**
   - The bottom half of the igloo has 10 rows since the total number of rows is 10.
   - Each row in the bottom half has 12 bricks of snow.
   \[
   \text{Number of bricks in the bottom half} = 10 \times 12 = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of bricks in the top half:**
   - The top half of the igloo also has 10 rows.
   - Each row in the top half has 8 bricks of snow.
   \[
   \text{Number of bricks in the top half} = 10 \times 8 = 80
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bricks used:**
   - Add the number of bricks in the bottom half to the number of bricks in the top half.
   \[
   \text{Total number of bricks} = 120 + 80 = 200
   \]

Thus, Libby used a total of 200 bricks of snow for her igloo.

To find the total number of bricks used, we can break down the problem into two parts: the bottom half of the igloo and the top half of the igloo.

1. **Bottom Half (First 5 rows)**:
   Each row has 12 bricks. Therefore, the total number of bricks in the bottom half is calculated as:
   \[
   12 \text{ bricks} \times 5 \text{ rows} = 60 \text{ bricks}
   \]

2. **Top Half (Next 5 rows)**:
   Each row has 8 bricks. Therefore, the total number of bricks in the top half is calculated as:
   \[
   8 \text{ bricks} \times 5 \text{ rows} = 40 \text{ bricks}
   \]

3. **Total Number of Bricks**:
   To find the total number of bricks used, we sum the bricks used in the bottom half and the top half:
   \[
   60 \text{ bricks} + 40 \text{ bricks} = 100 \text{ bricks}
   \]

So, Libby used \( 100 \) bricks of snow for her igloo.

To determine the total number of bricks Libby used, we first note that the igloo has 10 rows. The igloo is divided into two equal halves, with the bottom half having 12 bricks per row and the top half having 8 bricks per row.

First, we calculate the number of rows in each half:
\[
\text{Number of rows in the bottom half} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]
\[
\text{Number of rows in the top half} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

Next, we compute the total number of bricks in the bottom half:
\[
\text{Total bricks in the bottom half} = 5 \text{ rows} \times 12 \text{ bricks per row} = 60 \text{ bricks}
\]

Then, we compute the total number of bricks in the top half:
\[
\text{Total bricks in the top half} = 5 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ bricks per row} = 40 \text{ bricks}
\]

Finally, we sum the total number of bricks from both halves to get the overall total:
\[
\text{Total number of bricks} = 60 \text{ bricks} + 40 \text{ bricks} = 100 \text{ bricks}
\]

Therefore, Libby used 100 bricks of snow to build her igloo.

To determine the total number of bricks of snow Libby used for her igloo, we need to account for both the bottom half and the top half of the igloo.

First, let's calculate the number of bricks in the bottom half:
- The bottom half of the igloo has 12 bricks in each row.
- There are 5 rows in the bottom half (half of 10 rows).

So, the number of bricks in the bottom half is:
\[
12 \text{ bricks/row} \times 5 \text{ rows} = 60 \text{ bricks}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of bricks in the top half:
- The top half of the igloo also has 8 bricks in each row.
- There are 5 rows in the top half (half of 10 rows).

So, the number of bricks in the top half is:
\[
8 \text{ bricks/row} \times 5 \text{ rows} = 40 \text{ bricks}
\]

Finally, we add the number of bricks from the bottom half and the top half to find the total number of bricks used:
\[
60 \text{ bricks (bottom half)} + 40 \text{ bricks (top half)} = 100 \text{ bricks}
\]

Therefore, Libby used a total of 100 bricks of snow for her igloo.

To find out how many bricks of snow Libby used, we first need to break down the igloo into its top and bottom halves.

The bottom half of the igloo has 10 rows with 12 bricks of snow in each row. So, the number of bricks in the bottom half is calculated as 10 rows * 12 bricks/row = 120 bricks.

Since there are 10 rows in total, the top half will have the remaining rows, which is also 10 rows - 5 rows (since the bottom half is 10 rows) = 5 rows. In each of these rows, there are 8 bricks of snow.

So, the number of bricks in the top half is 5 rows * 8 bricks/row = 40 bricks.

Now, to find the total number of bricks used for the igloo, we add the bricks from the bottom half and the top half: 120 bricks + 40 bricks = 160 bricks.

Therefore, Libby used 160 bricks of snow for her igloo.

To determine the total number of bricks Libby used for her igloo, we need to calculate the number of bricks in the bottom half and the top half separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that the igloo has 10 rows in total. Since the top half of the igloo has 8 bricks in each row, the bottom half also has 8 bricks in each row. However, since the igloo is symmetrically split, the bottom half will be 5 rows high (half of 10 rows).

The number of bricks in the top half can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of bricks in the top half} = 5 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ bricks per row} = 40 \text{ bricks} \]

The number of bricks in the bottom half is the same as the top half:
\[ \text{Number of bricks in the bottom half} = 5 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ bricks per row} = 40 \text{ bricks} \]

Adding the bricks from the top half and the bottom half gives us the total number of bricks:
\[ \text{Total number of bricks} = 40 \text{ bricks (top half)} + 40 \text{ bricks (bottom half)} = 80 \text{ bricks} \]

So, Libby used 80 bricks of snow for her igloo.

To find out how many bricks of snow Libby used, we need to calculate the bricks used in both halves of the igloo and then sum them up.

1. The igloo has 10 rows in total. Since half of the rows are in the bottom half, we divide the number of rows in half: 10 / 2 = 5 rows for the bottom half.
2. The bottom half has 12 bricks in each row, so we multiply the number of rows by the number of bricks per row to get the total number of bricks in the bottom half: 5 rows * 12 bricks/row = 60 bricks.
3. The top half of the igloo is the remaining half of the rows, which also have 12 bricks in each row: 5 rows * 12 bricks/row = 60 bricks.
4. Adding both halves, we get the total number of bricks: 60 bricks (bottom half) + 60 bricks (top half) = 120 bricks.

To determine the total number of bricks Libby used for her igloo, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of rows in the top half of the igloo:**
   Since the igloo has a total of 10 rows, the bottom half also has 10 rows. This means the top half also has 10 rows because 10 is half of 20.
   
2. **Calculate the number of bricks in the bottom half:**
   Each row in the bottom half has 12 bricks. Therefore, the total number of bricks in the bottom half is:
   \[
   10 \text{ rows} \times 12 \text{ bricks/row} = 120 \text{ bricks}

3. **Calculate the number of bricks in the top half:**
   Each row in the top half has 8 bricks. Therefore, the total number of bricks in the top half is:
   \[
   10 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ bricks/row} = 80 \text{ bricks}
