To determine the number of emus in Farmer Brown's flock, we need to consider the characteristics of emus and the given data.

1. **Understanding the problem**: Emus are large birds that have two legs and one head. This means that each emu contributes 3 "units" (1 head + 2 legs) to the total head and leg count.

2. **Setting up the equation**: Let \( n \) be the number of emus in Farmer Brown's flock. Since each emu contributes 3 units, the total number of units (heads plus legs) in the flock is \( 3n \). We know from the problem statement that the total number of heads and legs is 60. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   3n = 60
   \]

3. **Solving the equation**: To find the value of \( n \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   n = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]

4. **Verification**: We can verify this by calculating the total number of units if there are 20 emus. If \( n = 20 \), then \( 3n = 3 \times 20 = 60 \), which matches the given total number of heads and legs.

Therefore, the number of emus in Farmer Brown's flock is 20.

To find out how many emus Farmer Brown has in his flock, we need to consider the given information: the total number of heads and legs.

Each emu has 1 head and 2 legs, and assuming all the heads and legs are from emus, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let \( E \) be the number of emus. Then the total number of heads is \( E \) and the total number of legs is \( 2E \).

The total number of heads and legs is given to be 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ E + 2E = 60 \]
\[ 3E = 60 \]
\[ E = \frac{60}{3} \]
\[ E = 20 \]

So, the answer is 20 emus.

Let's denote the number of emus by \( e \). Each emu has 1 head and 2 legs, so the total number of heads and legs is given by:

\[ e \times (1 + 2) = 3e \]

We know the total number of heads and legs is 60, so we have:

\[ 3e = 60 \]

To find the number of emus, we solve for \( e \):

\[ e = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, there are 20 emus in his flock.

Let's denote the number of emus as E. Each emu has 1 head and 2 legs, so each emu adds 1 (for the head) + 2 (for the legs) = 3 (total) heads and legs together. Therefore, the total number of heads and legs is equal to 3 times the number of emus. This can be represented by the equation:

\[3E = 60\]

To find the number of emus, we solve for E:

\[E = \frac{60}{3} = 20\]

So, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock.

Let's denote the number of emus as E and the number of legs for each emu as 2.

The total number of heads is equivalent to the total number of emus, so we have E heads.

The total number of legs is the sum of each emu's legs, which gives us 2E legs.

Given that the total number of heads and legs is 60, we can write the equation:
\[ E + 2E = 60 \]
\[ 3E = 60 \]
\[ E = 20 \]

So, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock.

system
To determine the number of emus in Farmer Brown's flock, we need to consider the number of heads and legs. 

1. Each emu has one head and one leg, so each emu contributes 2 heads and legs combined.
2. We know the total number of heads and legs is 60.
3. Let's denote the number of emus as \( x \).

Since each emu has 2 heads and legs, the total number of heads and legs can be expressed as \( 2x \). This equation represents the total combined head and leg count for all emus.

4. Given that the total number of heads and legs is 60, we set up the equation:
   \[
   2x = 60
   \]

5. Solving for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Therefore, there are 30 emus in Farmer Brown's flock.

To determine the number of emus in Farmer Brown's flock, we need to consider the following details:
- Each emu has 1 head and 2 legs.
- We are given that the total number of heads and legs is 60.

Let's denote:
- \( e \) as the number of emus.

From the information given:
- The total number of heads is \( e \) (since each emu has 1 head).
- The total number of legs is \( 2e \) (since each emu has 2 legs).

The equation representing the total number of heads and legs in the flock is:
\[ e + 2e = 60 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3e = 60 \]

To find the number of emus, we solve for \( e \):
\[ e = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock.

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of heads and legs. We know that emus have 1 head and 2 legs. Let's set up our equation:

1. Let the number of emus be \( x \).
2. Since each emu has 1 head, the total number of heads is \( x \).
3. Since each emu has 2 legs, the total number of legs is \( 2x \).
4. The total number of heads and legs is given as 60.

Setting up the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 60 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{60}{3} \]

\[ x = 20 \]

So, the total number of emus in Farmer Brown's flock is 20.

To determine the number of emus in Farmer Brown's flock, we need to consider the number of heads (which is the same as the number of emus) and the total number of heads and legs.

Each emu has one head and two legs. Therefore, for each emu, there are 3 "heads and legs" in total.

The total number of heads and legs for the entire flock is given as 60. Since each emu contributes 3 to this total, we can find the number of emus by dividing the total number of heads and legs by 3.

\[
\text{Number of emus} = \frac{\text{Total number of heads and legs}}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = 20
\]

So, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock.

To determine the number of emus in Farmer Brown's flock, we need to consider that each emu has 1 head and 2 legs. Thus, the total number of "head and leg units" can help us solve this:

1. Calculate the total number of head and legs given by the total number of heads and legs: Total = 60
2. Determine the contribution of each emu to the total: Emus contribute 1 head + 2 legs = 3 units.
3. Set up the equation where the total number of units equals the total number of emus: $3 \times \text{number of emus} = 60$

Given that 3 units correspond to 1 emu, we can set up a proportion:

\[3 \text{ units/emu} \times \text{number of emus} = 60 \text{ units}\]

From this, we can solve for the number of emus:

\[\text{number of emus} = \frac{60}{3} = 20\]

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation with variables representing the number of emus and their characteristics.

Let's define:
- \( E \) as the number of emus.

Each emu has one head and two legs. This means:

1. The total number of heads is equal to the number of emus \( E \).
2. Each emu has 2 legs, so the total number of legs is \( 2E \).

We know from the problem statement that the total number of heads and legs is 60. Therefore:

\[
E + 2E = 60
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
3E = 60
\]

Solving for \( E \):

\[
E = \frac{60}{3} = 20
\]

So, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock.
