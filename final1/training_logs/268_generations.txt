system
To find the average number of carnations in the bouquets, we first need to sum the total number of carnations and then divide by the number of bouquets.

The total number of carnations is calculated as follows:
9 (first bouquet) + 14 (second bouquet) + 13 (third bouquet) = 36 carnations.

The number of bouquets is 3.

So the average number of carnations in the bouquets is 36 / 3 = 12.

To find the average number of carnations in the bouquets, we first need to calculate the total number of carnations and then divide by the number of bouquets.

Total number of carnations = 9 + 14 + 13 = 36

Number of bouquets = 3

Average number of carnations = Total number of carnations / Number of bouquets

Average number of carnations = 36 / 3 = 12

To find the average number of carnations in the bouquets, we add the number of carnations in each bouquet and then divide by the number of bouquets.

The number of carnations in the first bouquet is 9.
The number of carnations in the second bouquet is 14.
The number of carnations in the third bouquet is 13.

Total number of carnations = 9 + 14 + 13 = 36
Number of bouquets = 3

Average number of carnations = Total number of carnations / Number of bouquets
Average number of carnations = 36 / 3
Average number of carnations = 12

To find the average number of carnations, we first need to add up the number of carnations in all the bouquets and then divide by the total number of bouquets.

The total number of carnations is:
9 (from the first bouquet) + 14 (from the second bouquet) + 13 (from the third bouquet) = 36

The total number of bouquets is:
1 (first bouquet) + 1 (second bouquet) + 1 (third bouquet) = 3

Now, we can find the average by dividing the total number of carnations by the total number of bouquets:

Average = 36 carnations / 3 bouquets = 12 carnations per bouquet
