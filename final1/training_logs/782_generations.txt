John writes 3 stories every week.  Each short story is 50 pages.  He also writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year.  Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages.  Over 12 weeks, how many reams of paper does he need to buy if a ream contains 500 sheets?

John writes 3 stories every week, each containing 50 pages. Over 12 weeks, the number of story pages is:
\[ 3 \text{ stories/week} \times 50 \text{ pages/story} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 1800 \text{ pages} \]

Additionally, he writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year. Over 12 weeks, that is \( \frac{1200 \text{ pages}}{12 \text{ weeks}} = 100 \text{ pages} \).

So, the total number of pages he writes over 12 weeks is:
\[ 1800 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 1900 \text{ pages} \]

Paper is sold by the ream, each ream containing 500 sheets. Each sheet holds 2 pages, so each ream contains:
\[ 500 \text{ sheets/ream} \times 2 \text{ pages/sheet} = 1000 \text{ pages} \]

To find the number of reams John needs over 12 weeks, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per ream:
\[ \frac{1900 \text{ pages}}{1000 \text{ pages/ream}} = 1.9 \text{ reams} \]

Since John cannot buy a fraction of a ream and needs to buy a full ream for the additional pages, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, John needs to buy 2 reams of paper.

John writes 3 stories every week, each 50 pages. Therefore, he writes \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) pages per week for the stories. Over 12 weeks, he writes \( 150 \times 12 = 1800 \) pages for the stories. Additionally, he writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year. So in 12 weeks, he writes \( 1200 \) pages for the novel. In total, he writes \( 1800 + 1200 = 3000 \) pages in 12 weeks.

Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages. Therefore, he will need \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \) sheets of paper.

Since a ream contains 500 sheets, he will need \( \frac{1500}{500} = 3 \) reams of paper.

<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the total number of pages John writes in a week for stories and the novel. John writes 3 stories, each 50 pages, so for stories, he writes \(3 \times 50 = 150\) pages per week.

Additionally, he writes a novel that is 1200 pages per year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, he writes \(1200 / 52 \approx 23.08\) pages per week from the novel.

So, over 12 weeks, he writes \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) pages from the stories, and \(23.08 \times 12 \approx 277\) pages from the novel. In total, he writes \(1800 + 277 = 2077\) pages in a month.

Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, so the total number of sheets required is \(2077 / 2 \approx 1038.5\) sheets. Since a ream contains 500 sheets, he needs \(\lceil 1038.5 / 500 \rceil = 2\) reams of paper.
</reasoning>

</answer>
The calculation shows that John needs 2 reams of paper to write for 12 weeks. Therefore, the answer is 2 reams of paper.

John writes 3 stories every week, each story is 50 pages, so the total number of pages for the stories in a week is 3 * 50 = 150 pages. In one year, there are 52 weeks, so the total number of pages for the stories in a year is 52 * 150 = 7800 pages.
He also writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year, so the total number of pages for the novel in a year is 1200 pages.
Therefore, the total number of pages he writes in a year is 7800 + 1200 = 9000 pages.
Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, so the total number of sheets he needs is 9000 / 2 = 4500 sheets.
A ream contains 500 sheets, so the number of reams he needs to buy is 4500 / 500 = 9 reams.

John writes 3 stories every week, each 50 pages, so he writes \(3 \times 50 = 150\) pages from stories each week. 

Additionally, he writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year. 

In 12 weeks, he would write \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) pages from stories. 

Adding the pages from the novel, \(1800 + 1200 = 3000\) pages in total.

Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, so he needs \(3000 / 2 = 1500\) sheets of paper.

Since each ream contains 500 sheets, he needs \(1500 / 500 = 3\) reams of paper.

Therefore, John needs to buy 3 reams of paper.

John writes 3 stories every week, and each story is 50 pages long. Therefore, he writes \(3 \times 50 = 150\) pages from short stories each week. Additionally, he writes a novel that is 1200 pages every year. Over 12 weeks, the number of pages from the short stories is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) pages, plus the 1200 pages for the novel.

Total pages written in 12 weeks = 1800 pages from short stories + 1200 pages from the novel = 3000 pages.

Since each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, the number of sheets needed is \(3000 / 2 = 1500\) sheets. 

Since a ream contains 500 sheets, the number of reams needed is \(1500 / 500 = 3\) reams.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pages John writes from his short stories. He writes 3 stories every week and each story is 50 pages, so in a week he writes \(3 \times 50 = 150\) pages. Over 12 weeks, he will write \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) pages from his short stories.

Next, we add the pages from his novel. Since he writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year and there are 12 weeks in a year, the novel he writes each year is \(1200 \times \frac{12}{52} = 285.71\) pages in 12 weeks (assuming 52 weeks in a year). Over 12 weeks, he writes \(285.71 \times \frac{12}{52} = 66.71\) new pages from his novel.

Adding these together, the total number of pages he writes in 12 weeks is \(1800 + 66.71 = 1866.71\) pages. Since each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, John needs \(\frac{1866.71}{2} = 933.355\) sheets of paper. Since he can't buy a fraction of a sheet, we round up to 934 sheets.

Each ream of paper contains 500 sheets, so if he needs 934 sheets, he needs \(\frac{934}{500} = 1.868\) reams of paper. Since John can't buy a fraction of a ream, he needs to buy 2 reams of paper.

Therefore, John needs to buy 2 reams of paper.

John writes 3 stories every week, and each short story is 50 pages. Over 12 weeks, he writes \( 3 \times 50 \times 12 = 1800 \) pages in short stories.

Additionally, he writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year. Over 12 weeks, he writes \( \frac{1200}{52} \approx 23 \) pages of the novel (assuming a year has 52 weeks). This does not contribute significantly to the total, so we can ignore it.

Now, we add the pages from the short stories and the novel: \( 1800 + 23 = 1823 \) pages.

Since each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, the total number of sheets needed is \( \frac{1823}{2} = 911.5 \) sheets. Since we can't have a fraction of a sheet, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 912 sheets.

Now, we need to determine how many reams of paper are needed. A ream contains 500 sheets. So, we divide the total number of sheets by 500 and round up to the nearest whole number.

$$ \frac{912}{500} \approx 1.824 $$

Rounding up, we need 2 reams of paper.

John writes 3 stories every week, and each story is 50 pages. Therefore, in one week, he writes $3 \times 50 = 150$ pages. Over 12 weeks, he will write $150 \times 12 = 1800$ pages.

Additionally, he writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year. In 12 weeks, he writes $1200/52 \approx 23.08$ novels, which we'll round up to 24 novels since partial novels don't count. So the total pages for the novels over 12 weeks is $24 \times 1200 = 28800$ pages.

This gives us a total of $1800 + 28800 = 30000$ pages over 12 weeks.

Each sheet can hold 2 pages, so the total number of sheets needed is $\frac{30000}{2} = 15000$ sheets.

Since each ream contains 500 sheets, the number of reams he needs to buy is $\frac{15000}{500} = 30$ reams.
