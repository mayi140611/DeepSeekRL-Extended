To calculate the total number of legs, we need to consider each item's number of legs separately and then sum them up.

1. For the 4 tables: each table has 4 legs, so 4 tables × 4 legs/table = 16 legs.
2. For the 1 sofa: a sofa has 4 legs, so 1 sofa × 4 legs/sofa = 4 legs.
3. For the 2 chairs: each chair has 4 legs, so 2 chairs × 4 legs/chair = 8 legs.
4. For the 3 tables that have 3 legs each: 3 tables × 3 legs/table = 9 legs.
5. For the 1 table that has 1 leg: 1 table × 1 leg/table = 1 leg.
6. For the 1 rocking chair with 2 legs: 1 rocking chair × 2 legs/rocking chair = 2 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
16 (from 4 tables) + 4 (from 1 sofa) + 8 (from 2 chairs) + 9 (from 3 tables with 3 legs each) + 1 (from 1 table with 1 leg) + 2 (from 1 rocking chair) = 36 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs in the room is 36.

To determine the total number of legs in the room, we'll calculate the legs contributed by each type of furniture.

First, let's consider the table:
- There are 4 tables with 4 legs each.
- There is 1 table with 3 legs.
- There is 1 table with 1 leg.

Total legs from tables = (4 tables * 4 legs) + (1 table * 3 legs) + (1 table * 1 leg) = 16 + 3 + 1 = 18 legs.

Next, let's consider the sofa:
- Assuming a sofa typically has 4 legs, we'll assume the information about 4 legs per table applies to sofas as well.
- So, the sofa contributes 4 legs.

Now, let's consider the chairs:
- There are 2 chairs with 4 legs each.
- Total legs from chairs = (2 chairs * 4 legs) = 8 legs.

Finally, let's consider the rocking chair and tables with 1 leg:
- The rocking chair has 2 legs.
- There is 1 table with 1 leg.

Total legs from rocking chairs and tables with 1 leg = (2 legs) + (1 table * 1 leg) = 2 + 1 = 3 legs.

Summing all the legs together:
- Legs from tables: 18
- Legs from sofa: 4
- Legs from chairs: 8
- Legs from rocking chair: 2
- Legs from tables with 1 leg: 1

Total legs in the room = 18 + 4 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 33 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs in the room is 33.

The large room has the following furniture with the number of legs they each have:
- 4 tables with 4 legs: \(4 \times 4 = 16\) legs
- 1 sofa, which has unknown number of legs, so we'll call it \(x\)
- 2 chairs with 4 legs each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) legs
- 3 tables with 3 legs each: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) legs
- 1 table with 1 leg: \(1 \times 1 = 1\) leg
- 1 rocking chair with 2 legs: \(1 \times 2 = 2\) legs

Let's sum up all these legs:

16 (from tables with 4 legs) + \(x\) (unknown legs of the sofa) + 8 (from chairs with 4 legs) + 9 (from tables with 3 legs) + 1 (from the table with 1 leg) + 2 (from the rocking chair) = Total number of legs

\[
16 + x + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 = \text{Total number of legs}
\]

To find out \(x\), we need to consider the total number of legs in the room. We can calculate this by adding up all the known legs and then solving for \(x\).

\[
Total \, legs = (4 \times 4) + (1 \times 4) + (2 \times 4) + (3 \times 3) + (1) + (2)
\] 
\[
Total \, legs = 16 + 1 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 45 \, \text{legs}
\]

Since we know the total number of legs is 45, we can solve for \(x\):

\[
16 + x + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 45
\]

\[
45 - (16 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2) = x
\]

\[
45 - 44 = x
\]

\[
x = 1
\]

So, the sofa has 1 leg.

Now let's sum up all the legs again with the corrected sofa:

16 (from tables with 4 legs) + 1 (from sofa) + 8 (from chairs with 4 legs) + 9 (from tables with 3 legs) + 1 (from the table with 1 leg) + 2 (from the rocking chair) = 45 legs

Therefore, the answer is 45 legs.

To find the total number of legs in the room, we'll first calculate the number of legs from each item:

- For the 4 tables, each table has 4 legs.
  4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs

- For the 1 sofa and 2 chairs, each has 4 legs.
  1 sofa * 4 legs/sofa + 2 chairs * 4 legs/chair = 4 legs + 8 legs = 12 legs

- For the 3 tables with 3 legs each, each has 3 legs.
  3 tables * 3 legs/table = 9 legs

- For the 1 table with 1 leg, it has 1 leg.

- For the 1 rocking chair with 2 legs, it has 2 legs.

Now, we'll add up all these legs:
  16 legs (from the tables) + 12 legs (from the sofa and chairs) + 9 legs (from the tables with 3 legs) + 1 leg (from the table with 1 leg) + 2 legs (from the rocking chair) 

  Total legs = 16 + 12 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 40 legs.

The number of legs in the room is 40.

The first part of the room has 4 tables with 4 legs each, so that's 4 tables * 4 legs = 16 legs. 

The 1 sofa has 4 legs and the 2 chairs each have 4 legs as well, so that's 1 sofa * 4 legs + 2 chairs * 4 legs = 16 legs.

The second part of the room has 3 tables with 3 legs each, so that's 3 tables * 3 legs = 9 legs. 

The table with 1 leg contributes 1 leg to the total, and the rocking chair with 2 legs contributes 2 legs, so that's 1 leg + 2 legs = 3 legs. 

So, the total number of legs in the room is  16 + 16 + 9 + 3 = 44 legs.
