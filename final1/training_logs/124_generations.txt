###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Joy is winding balls of yarn for her cat to play with. The first ball is half the size of the second ball. The third ball is three times as large as the first ball. She used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. How many feet of yarn did she use for the second ball?

Let's denote the size of the first ball as \( x \). According to the problem:
1. The first ball is half the size of the second ball, so the second ball is \( 2x \) feet.
2. The third ball is three times the size of the first ball, so the third ball is \( 3x \) feet.
Given that the third ball used 27 feet of yarn, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 27 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{27}{3} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now that we have \( x = 9 \), we can find the size of the second ball:
\[ \text{Second ball size} = 2x = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the second ball used 18 feet of yarn.

system
Let the amount of yarn used for the first ball be \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the second ball is twice the size of the first ball, so it uses \( 2x \) feet of yarn. The third ball is three times as large as the first ball, so it uses \( 3x \) feet of yarn.

We know that the amount of yarn used for the third ball is 27 feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3x = 27 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]

So, the first ball used \( 9 \) feet of yarn. The second ball used \( 2x \) feet of yarn, which is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, the second ball used 18 feet of yarn.

Let's denote the amount of yarn used for the first ball as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the first ball is half the size of the second ball. Therefore, the second ball uses \( 2x \) feet of yarn. The third ball uses three times as much yarn as the first ball, so it uses \( 3x \) feet of yarn.

We know from the problem that Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 27 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]

So, the first ball uses 9 feet of yarn. Since the second ball uses \( 2x \) feet of yarn, we calculate:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, the amount of yarn used for the second ball is \(\boxed{18}\) feet.

Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. We know Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball.
2. The third ball is three times as large as the first ball. So, the first ball uses 27 feet / 3 = 9 feet of yarn.
3. The first ball is half the size of the second ball. So, the second ball uses twice as many feet as the first ball.
4. Therefore, the second ball uses 9 feet * 2 = 18 feet of yarn.

Now, let's move on to answering the question:

system
Let's denote the amount of yarn used for the first ball as \( y_1 \), for the second ball as \( y_2 \), and for the third ball as \( y_3 \).

From the problem, we know:
- The third ball is three times as large as the first ball: \( y_3 = 3 \cdot y_1 \).
- The first ball is half the size of the second ball: \( y_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot y_2 \).

We also know that she used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball: \( y_3 = 27 \) feet.

Using the relationship \( y_3 = 3 \cdot y_1 \), we can find \( y_1 \):
\[ 27 = 3 \cdot y_1 \]
\[ y_1 = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, using the relationship \( y_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot y_2 \), we can find \( y_2 \):
\[ 9 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot y_2 \]
\[ y_2 = 9 \cdot 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the number of feet of yarn she used for the second ball is 18.

Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. The first ball is half the size of the second ball, and the third ball is three times as large as the first ball. 

Let's denote the amount of yarn used for the first ball as \( F \) and the amount for the second ball as \( S \). According to the problem, \( F = \frac{1}{2}S \) and \( 3F = 27 \).

From \( 3F = 27 \), we can find \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the first ball uses 9 feet of yarn. Since \( F = \frac{1}{2}S \), we can find \( S \) as follows:
\[ 9 = \frac{1}{2}S \]
\[ S = 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

There's no need to show the reasoning in this problem, since the solution is straightforward and follows the given conditions.

Let's denote the size of the first ball as \( F \), the size of the second ball as \( S \), and the size of the third ball as \( Th \).

From the problem statement, we know:
1. The first ball is half the size of the second ball:
   \[
   F = \frac{1}{2} S
   \]

2. The third ball is three times as large as the first ball:
   \[
   Th = 3F
   \]

3. Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball:
   \[
   Th = 27 \text{ feet}
   \]

Since \( Th \) is given as 27 feet, we can substitute it into the third condition:
\[
3F = 27
\]

Solving for \( F \):
\[
F = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, using \( F = 9 \text{ feet} \) in the first condition:
\[
F = \frac{1}{2} S \implies 9 = \frac{1}{2} S \implies S = 18 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Joy used 18 feet of yarn for the second ball.

Let's denote the size of the second ball as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, the first ball is half the size of the second ball, so its size is \( \frac{S}{2} \) feet.

The third ball is three times as large as the first ball, so its size is \( 3 \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{3S}{2} \) feet.

We are given that she used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{3S}{2} = 27 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the third ball uses 27 feet of yarn.
2. The third ball is three times as large as the first ball.
3. Therefore, the first ball uses 27 / 3 = 9 feet of yarn.

Now, this is the relationship between the sizes of the balls.

To determine the amount of yarn used for the second ball, we need to take into consideration that the second ball is twice the size of the first ball. So, the second ball uses:

9 (size of first ball) * 2 = 18 feet

So, the answer is 18 feet.
