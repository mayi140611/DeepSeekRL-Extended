###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Marla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?

#### ANS ####

66
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
The total number of squares in the grid is \(10 \times 15 = 150\). 

Marla colors 4 rows with red, and each row has 6 squares, so the total number of squares colored red is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

Marla colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Each of these rows has 15 squares, so the total number of squares colored blue is \(2 \times 15 + 2 \times 15 = 60\).

The rest of the grid is colored green. The number of squares colored green is the total number of squares minus the number of squares colored red and blue. 

So, the number of squares colored green is \(150 - 24 - 60 = 66\).

First, calculate the total number of squares in the grid. The grid has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row, so the total number of squares is \(10 \times 15 = 150\).

Next, determine the number of squares colored red. Marla colors 4 rows with 6 squares each, so the total number of red squares is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

Then, calculate the number of blue squares. Marla colors all squares in the first 2 rows and all squares in the last 2 rows. The first 2 rows contain \(2 \times 15 = 30\) squares, and the last 2 rows also contain \(2 \times 15 = 30\) squares. So, the total number of blue squares is \(30 + 30 = 60\).

Now, find the number of green squares by subtracting the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares in the grid. The total number of green squares is \(150 - 24 - 60 = 66\).

To determine how many squares Marla colors green, we need to calculate the total number of colored squares in the grid and then subtract the number of squares colored red and blue from the total.

1. **Calculate the total number of squares in the grid:**
   \[
   10 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 150 \text{ squares}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of squares colored red:**
   Marla colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red.
   \[
   4 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ squares per row} = 24 \text{ squares}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of squares colored blue:**
   Marla colors all squares in the first 2 rows and the last 2 rows with blue.
   - First 2 rows: \(2 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 30 \text{ squares}\)
   - Last 2 rows: \(2 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 30 \text{ squares}\)
   \[
   30 \text{ squares} + 30 \text{ squares} = 60 \text{ squares}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of squares colored red and blue:**
   \[
   24 \text{ squares (red)} + 60 \text{ squares (blue)} = 84 \text{ squares}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of squares colored green:**
   Subtract the number of squares colored red and blue from the total number of squares.
   \[
   150 \text{ squares} - 84 \text{ squares} = 66 \text{ squares}
   \]

Therefore, Marla colors 66 squares green.

To find the total number of squares colored green, we can break down the problem:

1. **Total Squares in the Grid**:
   \[
   \text{Total Squares} = 10 \, \text{rows} \times 15 \, \text{squares/row} = 150 \, \text{squares}
   \]

2. **Red Squares**:
   Marla colors 4 rows from the middle of the grid (rows 4 to 7):
   \[
   \text{Red Squares} = 4 \, \text{rows} \times 6 \, \text{squares/row} = 24 \, \text{squares}
   \]

3. **Blue Squares**:
   She colors all the squares in the first 2 rows and the last 2 rows with blue:
   \[
   \text{Blue Squares} = (2 \, \text{rows} + 2 \, \text{rows}) \times 15 \, \text{squares/row} = 4 \times 15 = 60 \, \text{squares}
   \]

4. **Green Squares**:
   The rest of the squares are green. We can find the number of green squares by subtracting the red and blue squares from the total squares.
   \[
   \text{Green Squares} = \text{Total Squares} - \text{Red Squares} - \text{Blue Squares}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Green Squares} = 150 - 24 - 60 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of green squares Marla colors is 66.

The grid has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. 

1. Marla colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. This means 4 rows * 6 squares/row = 24 red squares.
2. She then colors the squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. There are 2 rows * 15 squares/row = 30 blue squares.
3. Now we have to find out how many squares are left to be colored green. The total number of squares is 10 rows * 15 squares/row = 150 squares.
4. The total number of squares colored in red and blue is 24 red squares + 30 blue squares = 54 squares.
5. To find out how many squares are colored green, we need to subtract the total number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares. Therefore, 150 squares - 54 squares = 96 squares colored green.

To determine how many squares Marla colors green, we first calculate the total number of squares in the grid. The grid has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row, so the total number of squares is \(10 \times 15 = 150\).

Next, we calculate the number of squares colored red. Marla colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. The middle rows are rows 4 through 9, so she colors \(4 \times 6 = 24\) squares red.

Then, we calculate the number of squares colored blue. Marla colors the squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. The first 2 rows are rows 1 and 2, and the last 2 rows are rows 8 and 9. Since only rows 6 through 9 fit within this range, she colors \(6 \times 15 = 90\) squares blue, but we must subtract the overlap with the red squares.

The squares that are both red (in the middle) and blue (on the ends) are the squares in rows 5 and 6, which are \(5 \times 6 = 30\) squares. Therefore, the number of squares colored blue is \(90 - 30 = 60\).

Now, we can find the number of squares colored green by subtracting the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares. The number of green squares is \(150 - 24 - 60 = 66\).

Thus, the number of squares Marla colors green is \(\boxed{66}\).

1. **Total number of squares in the grid:**
   The grid has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. Therefore, the total number of squares is:
   \[
   10 \times 15 = 150
   \]

2. **Squares colored red:**
   Marla colors 4 rows with red, and each of these rows has 6 squares. To find the total number of red squares:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

3. **Squares colored blue:**
   Marla colors the squares on the first 2 rows and the last 2 rows with blue. First, calculate the total number of rows, which is 10. Then subtract the first and last 2 rows to find the number of rows for blue coloring:

To find the number of green squares, we first need to calculate the total number of squares in the grid and then subtract the number of squares that are colored red and blue.

There are 10 rows and 15 squares in each row, so the total number of squares in the grid is:
\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 150 \text{ squares} \]

Next, we calculate the number of squares colored red. Marla colors 4 rows with red, and each row has 6 squares, so the total number of red squares is:
\[ 4 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ squares per row} = 24 \text{ red squares} \]

Now, we calculate the number of squares colored blue. Marla colors the first 2 rows and the last 2 rows with blue. The first 2 rows contain:
\[ 2 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 30 \text{ squares} \]
The last 2 rows contain:
\[ 2 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 30 \text{ squares} \]
So, the total number of blue squares is:
\[ 30 \text{ (first 2 rows)} + 30 \text{ (last 2 rows)} = 60 \text{ blue squares} \]

The number of green squares is the total number of squares minus the number of red squares minus the number of blue squares:
\[ 150 \text{ total squares} - 24 \text{ red squares} - 60 \text{ blue squares} = 66 \text{ green squares} \]

Therefore, Marla colors 66 squares green.

To find out how many squares Marla colors green, we need to apply the given rules to the grid. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total squares in the grid**: The grid has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row, so there are \(10 \times 15 = 150\) squares in total.

2. **Squares colored red**: Marla colors 4 rows with the red color. Each of these rows has 6 squares. So, the number of red squares is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

3. **Squares colored blue**: Marla colors all squares in the first 2 rows and the last 2 rows with the blue color. The first 2 rows contain \(2 \times 15 = 30\) squares, and the last 2 rows also contain \(2 \times 15 = 30\) squares. Therefore, the total number of blue squares is \(30 + 30 = 60\).

4. **Squares colored green**: To find out how many squares are left for the green color, we subtract the red and blue squares from the total number of squares.

- Squares remaining after red coloring: \(150 - 24 = 126\)
- Squares remaining after blue coloring: \(126 - 60 = 66\)

So, the total number of squares Marla colors green is \(66\).

To find the total number of squares that Marla colors with green, we first need to determine the total number of squares in the grid and then calculate how many squares are colored red and blue.

The grid is 10 rows by 15 columns, so there are a total of \(10 \times 15 = 150\) squares.

Marla colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle with red, so the red squares amount to \(4 \times 6 = 24\) squares.

She also colors the squares in the first and last 2 rows blue, which means \(2 \times 15 = 30\) blue squares.

The green squares would be the total squares in the grid minus the red and blue squares. To find the total number of squares colored green, we subtract the red and blue squares from the total number of squares.

\[
\text{Green squares} = 150 - (\text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares})\\
\text{Green squares} = 150 - (24 + 30)\\
\text{Green squares} = 150 - 54\\
\text{Green squares} = 96

To determine the number of squares Marla colors green, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the total number of squares in the grid:
\[
10 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 150 \text{ squares}
\]

Next, identify the number of squares colored with each color:
1. Marla colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red:
\[
4 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ squares per row} = 24 \text{ red squares}
\]

2. Marla colors all squares in the first 2 rows and the last 2 rows with blue:
\[
2 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} + 2 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ blue squares}
\]

3. The rest of the squares are colored green. To find the number of green squares, subtract the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares:
\[
150 \text{ total squares} - 24 \text{ red squares} - 60 \text{ blue squares} = 66 \text{ green squares}
\]

So, Marla colors \boxed{66} squares green.
