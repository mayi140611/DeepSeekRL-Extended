<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the cost of the drinks for James and his 5 friends. Since each drink costs $6, the total cost for drinks for James and his friends is:
\[ 6 \times 6 \times 5 + 6 \times 1 = 180 + 6 = 186 \]
Next, we calculate the cost of the fried chicken:
\[ 14 \]
James also buys drinks that total $6 each, so the cost for drinks and fried chicken is:
\[ 6 \times 1 + 6 \times 6 \times 2 + 14 = 6 + 72 + 14 = 92 \]
Finally, we need to calculate the tip on both the drinks and fried chicken:
\[ 0.30 \times 92 = 27.6 \]
So the total cost is:
\[ 186 + 92 + 27.6 = 305.6 \]

Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Entry fee**: $20
2. **Drinks for friends**: 2 rounds * 5 friends = 10 drinks, and each drink costs $6, so 10 * $6 = $60
3. **Drinks for himself**: 6 drinks, each costing $6, so 6 * $6 = $36
4. **Food**: $14
5. **Total before tip**: $20 + $60 + $36 + $14 = $120
6. **Tip**: 30% of the total before tip = 0.30 * $120 = $36
7. **Total after tip**: $120 + $36 = $156

Therefore, the total amount he spent for the night is $156.

1. **Cost of entrance**: The club charges $20 to enter. So, James spends $20 on the entrance fee.
2. **Cost of drinks**: James buys 5 friends and 1 friend's round, so he buys 6 rounds. Each round costs $6. Therefore, the cost of the drinks is \(6 \times 6 = \$36\).
3. **Cost of food**: James orders fried chicken for $14 and leaves a tip on everything.
4. **Cost of tip**: James leaves a 30% tip on the total cost of the drinks and the food.
    - Total cost of drinks and food before tip: \(36 + 14 = \$50\).
    - Tip amount: \(30\% \times 50 = 0.3 \times 50 = \$15\).
    - Total expenses for food and drinks including tip: \(50 + 15 = \$65\).
5. **Total expenses**: Add the entrance fee and the total cost of food and drinks including tip.
    - Total cost: \(20 + 65 = \$85\).

So, James spends a total of $85 for the night.

To determine the total amount James spent for the night, we need to break down the costs step-by-step:

1. **Entry Fee**: The club charges $20 to enter. 
2. **Drinks**: James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends, which means 6 rounds in total (2 rounds per friend * 5 friends). Each round costs $6. 
   - Cost of drinks: \(6 \text{ rounds} \times \$6/\text{round} = \$36\).
3. **Fried Chicken**: James orders $14 worth of fried chicken.
4. **Tips**: James leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders. Let's calculate the total amount before the tip:
   - Total cost: \(\$20 + \$36 + \$14 = \$70\).
   - Tip percentage: 30% of $70 = \(0.30 \times \$70 = \$21\).
5. **Final Total**: Adding the tip to the total cost:
   - Total spent: \(\$70 + \$21 = \$91\).

Therefore, James spent $91 for the night.

To determine the total amount James spent for the night, we need to calculate the costs of each item he bought and then sum them up. 

1. **Cost of entering the club**: 
   \[
   \text{Cost} = \$20
   \]

2. **Cost of drinks for friends**: 
   James buys 2 rounds of drinks for his 5 friends. Each friend gets 2 drinks, so:
   \[
   \text{Total drinks for friends} = 5 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ drinks per friend} = 10 \text{ drinks}
   \]
   Each drink costs $6, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of drinks for friends} = 10 \text{ drinks} \times \$6 \text{ per drink} = \$60
   \]

3. **Cost of drinks for himself**:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 6 \text{ drinks} \times \$6 \text{ per drink} = \$36
   \]

4. **Cost of fried chicken**:
   \[
   \text{Cost of fried chicken} = \$14
   \]

5. **Tip**:
   James leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders. The total cost of everything ordered without the tip is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without tip} = \$20 + \$60 + \$36 + \$14 = \$130
   \]
   The tip amount is 30% of the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 0.30 \times \$130 = \$39
   \]

6. **Total cost**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost without tip} + \text{Tip} = \$130 + \$39 = \$169
   \]

Therefore, James spent a total of $169 for the night.

To determine how much James spent for the night, we need to calculate the total cost of each item he purchased and then apply the tip.

1. **Cost of entry:**
   James pays $20 to enter the club.

2. **Cost of drinks for friends:**
   Each of James's 5 friends buys 2 rounds, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) drinks. Each drink costs $6, so the total cost for the friends' drinks is \(10 \times 6 = \$60\).

3. **Cost of drinks for James:**
   James buys 6 drinks, so the total cost for his drinks is \(6 \times 6 = \$36\).

4. **Cost of food:**
   James orders fried chicken for $14.

5. **Total cost before tip:**
   Adding up all these expenses, the total cost before tip is \(20 + 60 + 36 + 14 = \$130\).

6. **Tip calculation:**
   James leaves a 30% tip on everything he ordered, so the tip amount is \(130 \times 0.30 = \$39\).

7. **Total cost including tip:**
   Adding the tip to the total cost before tip, the amount James spent for the night is \(130 + 39 = \$169\).

Therefore, James spent $169 for the night.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- Entry fee: $20
- Cost of drinks for James's 5 friends: 5 friends * $6 / friend = $30
- Cost of drinks for James himself: 6 drinks * $6/drink = $36  
- Cost of fried chicken: $14

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the tip:

\[ \text{Total cost before tip} = \text{Entry fee} + \text{Cost of drinks for friends} + \text{Cost of drink for James} + \text{Cost of fried chicken} \]
\[ \text{Total cost before tip} = $20 + $30 + $36 + $14 \]
\[ \text{Total cost before tip} = $100 \]

Now, calculate the tip:

\[ \text{Tip} = \text{Tip percentage} \times \text{Total cost before tip} \]
\[ \text{Tip} = 0.30 \times $100 \]
\[ \text{Tip} = $30 \]

Finally, calculate the total amount spent by adding the total cost before tip and the tip:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost before tip} + \text{Tip} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = $100 + $30 \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = $130 \]

So, the total amount James spent for the night is $130.

First, let's calculate the cost of the drinks for James. Since he buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends, that's \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rounds for his friends. Since each round costs $6, the total cost of the drinks for his friends is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.
Then, he buys 6 drinks for himself, so the cost for those is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.
So far, the cost for drinks is \(36 + 36 = 72\) dollars.
He also orders fried chicken which costs $14.
Before we calculate the tip, we need to add the cost of the drinks plus the chicken, which is \(72 + 14 = 86\) dollars.
James leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders, so the tip is \(86 \times 0.30 = 25.8\) dollars.
Adding the tip to the cost of the drinks and chicken gives us the total cost of $86 + $25.8 = $111.80.

He spent $111.80 for the night.

To determine how much James spent for the night, we need to calculate the cost of each item he purchased and then sum it up with the tip.

1. **Entry fee**: The club charges $20 to enter.
2. **Drinks for his 5 friends**: Since he bought 2 rounds (which means 4 drinks in total), and each drink costs $6, the cost is \(4 \times 6 = 24\) dollars.
3. **Drinks for himself**: He bought 6 drinks, so the cost is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.
4. **Fried chicken**: He ordered fried chicken for $14.
5. **Tip calculation**: James leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders. Let's calculate the total cost before the tip: \(20 + 24 + 36 + 14 = 94\) dollars. The tip is \(0.30 \times 94 = 28.20\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of everything to the tip:
\(94 + 28.20 = 122.20\) dollars

So, the total amount spent is $122.20.

To determine the total amount James spent for the night, we need to calculate the cost of his entrance fee, drinks, food, and tip.

1. **Cost of Entrance Fee:**
   - The entrance fee is $20.

2. **Cost of Drinks:**
   - James buys 2 rounds of drinks for his 5 friends, which means a total of 2 * 5 = 10 drinks.
   - Each drink costs $6, so the total cost for drinks is 10 * $6 = $60.
   - He also buys 6 drinks for himself, which cost 6 * $6 = $36.
   - Therefore, the total cost for drinks is $60 + $36 = $96.

3. **Cost of Food:**
   - James orders fried chicken for $14.
   - Therefore, the total cost for food is $14.

4. **Cost of Tip:**
   - He leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders.
   - The total cost without the tip is $20 + $96 + $14 = $130.
   - The tip amount is 30% of $130 = 0.30 * $130 = $39.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the entrance fee, the cost of drinks, the cost of food, and the tip together, we get $20 + $96 + $14 + $39 = $169.

Therefore, the total amount James spent for the night is $169.

2. **Drinks for Friends**:  
   James buys 2 rounds of drinks for his 5 friends.  
   Cost of drinks for each round (5 friends):

   \[ 2 \text{ rounds} \times \$30/\text{round} = \$60 \]

3. **Drinks for Himself**:
