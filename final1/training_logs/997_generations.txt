<reasoning>
Let's denote Jethro's amount of money as \( x \). According to the problem:

1. Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has, which means Carmen's current amount of money is \( 2x - 7 \).
2. Patricia has $60, which is 3 times as much as Jethro, so we can write \( 3x = 60 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \).

Now, substituting \( x = 20 \) into Carmen's amount, we get:
\[ \text{Carmen's money} = 2 \times 20 - 7 = 40 - 7 = 33 \]

So, we have:
- Jethro has \( x = 20 \) dollars.
- Carmen has $33.
- Patricia has $60.

The total sum of all their money is \( 20 + 33 + 60 = 113 \).

Let's denote the amount of money Jethro has as \( J \). According to the problem, Patricia has $60, and that amount is 3 times the amount that Jethro has. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 60 = 3J \]
From this equation, we can solve for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]
So, Jethro has $20.

Next, let's find out how much money Carmen has. The problem states that Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has. This means that if Carmen has \( C \) dollars, then:
\[ C + 7 = 2 \times 20 \]
Since \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ C + 7 = 40 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 40 - 7 = 33 \]
So, Carmen has $33.

Now, to find the total sum of all their money, we add the amounts for Jethro, Patricia, and Carmen:
\[ Jethro's \, money + Patricia's \, money + Carmen's \, money = 20 + 60 + 33 = 113 \]
Therefore, the total sum of their money is $113.

Let's denote the amount of money Jethro has as J.

According to the problem statement:
- Patricia has $60 and this amount is 3 times as much as Jethro. This gives us the equation: 
\[ 60 = 3J \]
From this, we can solve for J:
\[ J = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]
So, Jethro has $20.

Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J + 7 = \text{Carmen's amount} \]
Since Carmen needs $7 more to have twice Jethro's amount, let's denote Carmen's amount as C, then:
\[ C = 2J + 7 = 40 + 7 = 47 \]

The total amount of money that Carmen, Jethro, and Patricia have combined is:
\[ Jethro's amount + Carmen's amount + Patricia's amount = 20 + 47 + 60 = 127 \]

So, the sum of all their money is $127.

To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables for the amount of money each person has:

- Let \( C \) be the amount of money Carmen has.
- Let \( J \) be the amount of money Jethro has.
- Let \( P \) be the amount of money Patricia has.

From the problem statement, we know:
1. Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has, so \( C + 7 = 2J \).
2. Patricia has $60, which is 3 times as much as Jethro, so \( P = 60 \) and \( P = 3J \).

First, since \( P = 60 \), we can substitute \( P \) with 60 in the second equation:
\[ 60 = 3J \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Now that we know Jethro has $20, we can substitute \( J = 20 \) into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 7 = 2(20) \]
\[ C + 7 = 40 \]
\[ C = 40 - 7 \]
\[ C = 33 \]

So, Carmen has $33, Jethro has $20, and Patricia has $60.

The total sum of their money is:
\[ C + J + P \]
\[ = 33 + 20 + 60 \]
\[ = 113 \]

Therefore, the sum of all their money is $113.

Let's denote the amount of money Jethro has as \( J \).

According to the problem, Patricia has $60, which is 3 times as much as Jethro. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3J = 60 \]

Solving for \( J \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ J = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, Jethro has $20.

Next, we know that Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has. Let's denote the amount of money Carmen has as \( C \). According to the problem:
\[ C + 7 = 2J \]

Since we already know \( J = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ C + 7 = 2 \times 20 \]
\[ C + 7 = 40 \]

Solving for \( C \), we subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ C = 40 - 7 = 33 \]

So, Carmen has $33.

Finally, we need to find the sum of all their money:
\[ J + C + P = 20 + 33 + 60 = 113 \]

Therefore, the sum of all their money is $113.

1. Let's start by breaking down the information provided:
   - Jethro has \( x \) dollars.
   - Patricia has \( 60 \) dollars.
   - Patricia's amount ($60) is 3 times Jethro's amount, so we can write \( 3x = 60 \).

2. Solving for \( x \) (Jethro's amount):
   \[
   x = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]

3. Now that we know Jethro has $20, we can find out how much money Carmen needs to have twice Jethro's amount:
   - Twice Jethro's amount is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.
   - Carmen needs $7 more than this to reach the amount:
     \[
     40 + 7 = 47
     \]

4. Summing up all the amounts:
   - Carmen's money: \( 47 \) dollars.
   - Jethro's money: \( 20 \) dollars.
   - Patricia's money: \( 60 \) dollars.

5. Adding up all these values gives us the total sum:
   \[
   47 + 20 + 60 = 127
   \]

Therefore, the total sum of their money is $127.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Patricia has $60.
2. Patricia has 3 times as much money as Jethro. Therefore, Jethro has $60 / 3 = $20.
3. Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount Jethro has. This means if Carmen has C dollars, she needs C + $7 to have $2 * 20 = $40.
4. The equation representing this situation is \( C + 7 = 40 \).

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 40 - 7 = 33 \]

So, Carmen has $33.

Now, let's find the total amount of money all three have together:

Jethro has $20.
Patricia has $60.
Carmen has $33.

The sum of their money is \( 20 + 60 + 33 = 113 \).

Therefore, the sum of all their money is $113.

Let's denote the amount of money Carmen has as \( C \), the amount Jethro has as \( J \), and the amount Patricia has as \( P \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has. This can be written as:
\[ C + 7 = 2J \]

2. Patricia has $60, which is 3 times as much as Jethro. This can be written as:
\[ P = 60 \]
\[ P = 3J \]
From this, we find:
\[ 60 = 3J \]
\[ J = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Now we substitute \( J = 20 \) into the first equation:
\[ C + 7 = 2 \times 20 \]
\[ C + 7 = 40 \]
\[ C = 40 - 7 \]
\[ C = 33 \]

So, Carmen has $33, Jethro has $20, and Patricia has $60.

To find the sum of all their money, we add them together:
\[ C + J + P = 33 + 20 + 60 \]

Now let's calculate the sum:
\[ 33 + 20 = 53 \]
\[ 53 + 60 = 113 \]

Therefore, the sum of all their money is $113.
