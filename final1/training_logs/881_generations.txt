Bobby needs to buy a new pair of fancy shoes.  He decides to go to a cobbler and get them handmade.  The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold.  He then charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes.  The cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes, since it is his first pair of shoes.

To determine how much Bobby paid for the handmade shoes, we need to calculate the cost of the mold and the cost of the work for the shoes, taking into account the 80% discount on the work.

1. The cost of making the mold is $250.
2. The daily rate to make the shoes is $75 per hour, and it takes 8 hours to make the shoes. So the cost for making the shoes is $75 * 8 = $600.
3. The cobbler will charge 80% of the cost of making the shoes, so the discounted cost for the work is $600 * 80% = $600 * 0.8 = $480.
4. Adding the cost of the mold and the discounted cost of the work gives the total amount Bobby paid: $250 + $480 = $730.

Therefore, Bobby paid $730 for the handmade shoes.

The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold.
The cobbler charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes, which is a total of $75 x 8 = $600.
The cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes, so the cost for the shoes is $75 x 8 x 0.8 = $540.
Therefore, Bobby paid a total of $250 + $540 = $790.

The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold. The cobbler charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes, so the total cost for the work is $75/hour * 8 hours = $600. The cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes, so the cobbler will charge 80% * $600 = $480 for the work. Therefore, the total cost for Bobby is $250 (mold) + $480 (work) = $730.

The cobbler charges a mold-making fee of $250. He charges $75 per hour for 8 hours, which equals a total of $75 x 8 = $600. However, the cobbler only agrees to charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes, so Bobby needs to pay 80% of $600, which is $600 x 0.8 = $480. Adding the mold-making fee, Bobby pays a total of $250 + $480 = $730.

To determine how much Bobby pays for the handmade shoes, we need to calculate the cost of the mold and the work to make the shoes, and then apply the discount for the first pair.

1. The cost of the mold is $250.
2. The cobbler charges $75 per hour for 8 hours to make the shoes, so the base cost for the work is $75 * 8 = $600.
3. However, the cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for the work, so we calculate 80% of $600, which is $600 * 0.8 = $480.
4. The total cost before the discount is $250 (mold) + $480 (work) = $730.
5. Since it is Bobby's first pair of shoes, he is only charged 80% of the total cost, so the final amount Bobby pays is $730 * 0.8 = $584.

The cobbler's total charge is $250 + $480 = $730, and since it's Bobby's first pair, he receives 80% of this, resulting in a final payment of $1460.

To determine how much Bobby paid, we need to calculate the costs involved:

1. The cost to make the mold: $250
2. The cost to make the shoes, which is $75 per hour for 8 hours. Therefore, the total cost for making the shoes is $75 * 8 = $600.
3. Since the cobbler charges 80% of the cost for work, we calculate 80% of $600, which is $600 * 0.8 = $480.

Next, we add the cost to make the mold and the 80% of the cost for making the shoes:

Total cost = Cost to make the mold + 80% of the cost for making the shoes
Total cost = $250 + $480
Total cost = $730

Therefore, Bobby paid $730.

First, let's calculate the cost of making the shoes. The cobbler charges $75 per hour for 8 hours, so the total cost for making the shoes is $75 * 8 = $600.

Next, the cobbler agrees to charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes. So, the cost for the work is 80% of $600, which is 0.80 * $600 = $480.

Now, the total cost for Bobby is the mold cost plus the cost for the work, which is $250 + $480 = $730.

The answer is $730.

First, we calculate the cost of the mold. The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold, not 80% of that cost. Therefore, the mold cost remains $250. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the work to make the shoes. The cobbler charges $75 per hour for 8 hours, but only to work 80% of that cost, so the hourly rate after the discount is $75 * 0.8 = $60 per hour. Therefore, the cost of the work to make the shoes is 60 * 8 = $480.

Finally, we add the cost of the mold and the cost of the work to get the total cost Bobby paid: $250 + $480 = $730.

First, we calculate the total cost of the work required to make the shoes. The cobbler charges $75 per hour for 8 hours, so the total labor cost is $75 * 8 = $600. 

Next, the cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for the work, so the labor cost with the discount is $600 * 0.8 = $480.

The cobbler also charges a one-time cost of $250 to make the mold. Adding the mold cost to the discounted labor cost gives us the total cost. So, $480 + $250 = $730.

Therefore, Bobby paid $730 in total.

To determine how much Bobby paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the first pair of shoes and then apply the 80% discount to the cobbler's charge.

1. **Cost of making the mold**: $250.
2. **Cost of making the shoes**: 
   - The cobbler charges $75 an hour for 8 hours.
   - Therefore, the total cost for making the shoes is \( 75 \times 8 = 600 \) dollars.
3. **Discount on the shoes cost**: 
   - The cobbler agrees to charge only 80% of the cost of making the shoes.
   - So, the discounted cost for the shoes is \( 600 \times 0.8 = 480 \) dollars.
4. **Total cost including mold**: 
   - Adding the cost of the mold and the discounted cost of the shoes.
   - Total cost = \( 250 + 480 = 730 \) dollars.

Therefore, Bobby paid a total of $730.

To determine the total cost Bobby paid, we need to calculate the cost of making the mold and the cost of making the shoes, then apply the 80% discount for the work done on Bobby's first pair of shoes.

1. **Cost of making the mold:** 
   The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold.

2. **Cost of making the shoes:**
   - The cobbler charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for shoes} = 75 \times 8 = 600
   \]

3. **Total cost of making the shoes before discount:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$250 + \$600 = \$850
   \]

4. **Applying the 80% discount:**
   Since the cobbler agreed to only charge 80% of the cost for work on Bobby's first pair of shoes, we need to calculate the discounted cost:
   \[
   \text{Discounted cost} = 0.80 \times 850 = 680

5. **Total amount Bobby paid:**
   Bobby paid the discounted cost for the shoes.

To determine how much Bobby paid for the handmade shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the project, taking into account the mold cost and the hourly rate for the work. 

1. The mold cost is $250.
2. The hourly rate for making shoes is $75 per hour, and the cobbler worked for 8 hours, so the cost for the work is $75/hour * 8 hours = $600.
3. The cobbler agreed to charge only 80% of the total cost for the work, so the cobbler's charge is 80% of the total cost of the work, which is 0.80 * $600 = $480.

Now, we add the mold cost and the cobbler's charge to get the total cost Bobby paid:
Mold cost + 80% of work cost = $250 + $480 = $730

Therefore, Bobby paid a total of $730 for the handmade shoes.

To determine how much Bobby paid for the handmade shoes, we need to calculate the total cost components and apply the discount.

1. **Cost of the Mold:** The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold.
   \[
   \text{Mold cost} = \$250

2. **Cost of Work:** The cobbler charges $75 an hour for 8 hours of work. We need to find out the total cost of the work before applying the discount.
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \$75 \text{ per hour}

   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 8 \text{ hours}

3. **Discount:** The cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for the work.
