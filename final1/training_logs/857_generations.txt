To determine the total number of toothbrushes given away in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of patients seen in a single 8-hour day.
2. Calculate the number of toothbrushes given away per patient.
3. Multiply the number of patients seen in one day by the number of toothbrushes given per patient to find the number given away in one day.
4. Finally, multiply the daily number of toothbrushes by the number of days in a work week to get the total for the week.

First, we calculate the number of patients seen in a single 8-hour day:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \div 0.5 \text{ hours/visit} = 16 \text{ patients/day} \]

Each patient receives 2 toothbrushes, so:
\[ 16 \text{ patients/day} \times 2 \text{ toothbrushes/patient} = 32 \text{ toothbrushes/day} \]

Since the office is open for 5 days in a week, the total number of toothbrushes given away in a week is:
\[ 32 \text{ toothbrushes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 160 \text{ toothbrushes/week} \]

To determine how many toothbrushes the dental office gives away in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of patients the dentist sees in one day.
2. Determine how many toothbrushes are given to these patients in one day.
3. Multiply the daily output by the number of days in the work week.

First, the dentist sees 8 hours of work divided by the average time spent on each visit, which is 0.5 hours per visit. So, the number of patients seen in one day is:
\[ \text{Number of patients per day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/visit}} = 16 \text{ patients} \]

Each patient receives 2 toothbrushes, so in one day the dentist gives away:
\[ \text{Toothbrushes per day} = 16 \text{ patients} \times 2 \text{ toothbrushes/patient} = 32 \text{ toothbrushes} \]

Since the dentist works 5 days a week, the total number of toothbrushes given away in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \text{Total toothbrushes per week} = 32 \text{ toothbrushes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 160 \text{ toothbrushes} \]

The dental office gives away 2 toothbrushes per patient visit, and each visit takes 0.5 hours. In an 8-hour workday, the office can provide 8/0.5 = 16 visits. Since each visit results in the giving away 2 toothbrushes, the total number of toothbrushes given out in a workday is 16 * 2 = 32 toothbrushes.

Since the dentist works 5 days a week, the total number of toothbrushes given out in a 5-day work week is 32 * 5 = 160 toothbrushes.

First, we'll calculate how many 5-hour blocks are in an 8-hour day. We have:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \div 5 \text{ hours/block} = 1.6 \text{ blocks/day} \]

Since each visit takes 0.5 hours, we can determine the number of patients served per day by dividing the number of blocks by the visit duration:

\[ 1.6 \text{ blocks/day} \div 0.5 \text{ hours/visit} = 3.2 \text{ visits/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many toothbrushes are given to all the patients in a 5-day week. Since 2 toothbrushes are given to each patient, we multiply the number of visits by the number of toothbrushes:

\[ 3.2 \text{ visits/day} \times 2 \text{ toothbrushes/visit} = 6.4 \text{ toothbrushes/day} \]

Finally, to find the total number of toothbrushes given in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of toothbrushes given in a day by the number of days in the week:

\[ 6.4 \text{ toothbrushes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 32 \text{ toothbrushes/week} \]

First, we need to determine how many patients visit the dental office in a 5-day work week. Each visit takes 0.5 hours, so in one 8-hour day, the dental office can see:

\[ \text{Number of patients per day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/visit}} = 16 \text{ patients/day} \]

Since the dentist works 5 days a week, the total number of patients he sees in a week is:

\[ \text{Total patients per week} = 16 \text{ patients/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 80 \text{ patients/week} \]

Since the dentist gives away 2 toothbrushes to each patient, the total number of toothbrushes given in a week is:

\[ \text{Total toothbrushes per week} = 80 \text{ patients/week} \times 2 \text{ toothbrushes/patient} = 160 \text{ toothbrushes/week} \]

Therefore, the dental office gives away 160 toothbrushes in a 5-day work week.

To determine the number of toothbrushes the dental office gives away in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of patients that visit in a 5-day work week.

1. First, calculate the number of patients that visit in one shift:
   \[
   \text{Number of patients per shift} = \frac{\text{Total hours per shift}}{\text{Visit duration}} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/visit}} = 16 \text{ patients}
   \]

2. Since the office works 8 hours a day and each visit takes 0.5 hours, the number of patients visiting per day is:
   \[
   \text{Number of patients per day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours/shift}}{0.5 \text{ hours/visit}} = 16 \text{ patients/day}
   \]

3. Now, calculate the number of patients visiting in a 5-day work week:
   \[
   \text{Number of patients per week} = 16 \text{ patients/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 80 \text{ patients/week}
   \]

4. Since the dental office gives away 2 toothbrushes to each patient, the total number of toothbrushes given out in a week is:
   \[
   \text{Total toothbrushes per week} = 80 \text{ patients/week} \times 2 \text{ toothbrushes/patient} = 160 \text{ toothbrushes/week}

\[ \text{patients per day} = \frac{8}{0.5} = 16 \]

Next, to find out how many toothbrushes he gives away in a given week, we multiply the number of patients per day by 2 (since he gives 2 toothbrushes to each patient) and then by 5 (since there are 5 days in a week):
\[ \text{toothbrushes per day} = 16 \times 2 = 32 \]
\[ \text{toothbrushes per week} = 32 \times 5 = 160 \]

So, the dental office gives away 160 toothbrushes in a 5-day work week.

To find out how many toothbrushes the dental office gives away in a 5-day work week, we need to first calculate the number of visits the dental office receives in one day and then multiply it by the number of toothbrushes given per visit.

The dental office has 8 hours of work per day, and each visit takes 0.5 hours. So, the number of visits per day is:
\[ \text{Visits per day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours per visit}} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of toothbrushes given away in one day and then multiply it by 5 (5 days):

\[ \text{Toothbrushes per 5-day week} = \left(\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours per visit}}\right) \times 2 \times 5 \]

Now, let's perform the calculations:

\[ \text{Visits per day} = \frac{8}{0.5} = 16 \]
\[ \text{Toothbrushes per day} = 16 \times 2 = 32 \]
\[ \text{Toothbrushes per 5-day week} = 32 \times 5 = 160 \]

Therefore, the dental office gives away 160 toothbrushes in a 5-day work week.

To determine the number of toothbrushes given in a 5-day work week, we need to first figure out how many patients the dentist sees in a day and then multiply that by the number of toothbrushes given to each patient. Finally, we multiply the daily toothbrush count by the number of work days in a week.

1. Calculate the number of patients seen in one day:
   - Each visit takes 0.5 hours.
   - There are 8 hours in a work day.
   - Number of patients in a day = Total hours in a work day / Hourly visits per patient = 8 / 0.5 = 16 patients.

2. Calculate the number of toothbrushes given in one day:
   - Each patient receives 2 toothbrushes.
   - Number of toothbrushes per day = Number of patients / Number of toothbrushes per patient = 16 * 2 = 32 toothbrushes.

3. Calculate the total number of toothbrushes given in a 5-day work week:
   - Total toothbrushes = Toothbrushes per day * Number of work days = 32 * 5 = 160 toothbrushes.

Therefore, the dentist gives away 160 toothbrushes in a 5-day work week.

Let's break down the information given:
- The dentist gives away 2 toothbrushes to every patient who visits.
- Each patient visit takes 0.5 hours.
- The dentist works 8 hours a day.
- The dentist works 5 days a week.

First, we need to calculate the number of patient visits the dentist can have in a day:
\[
\text{Number of visits per day} = \frac{\text{Total working hours per day}}{\text{Time per visit}} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/visit}} = 16 \text{ visits}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of patient visits in a week:
\[
\text{Number of visits per week} = \text{Number of visits per day} \times \text{Number of days per week} = 16 \text{ visits/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 80 \text{ visits}
\]

Since the dentist gives away 2 toothbrushes per patient visit, we can now calculate the total number of toothbrushes given away in a week:
\[
\text{Total toothbrushes per week} = \text{Number of visits per week} \times 2 = 80 \text{ visits} \times 2 \text{ toothbrushes/visit} = 160 \text{ toothbrushes}
\]

So, in a 5 day work week, the dentist gives away 160 toothbrushes.
