To determine the total number of visitors to the library for the entire week, we need to consider the number of visitors on each day.

1. On Monday, the library received 50 visitors.
2. On Tuesday, the library received twice the number of visitors from Monday, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) visitors.
3. For the remaining days of the week (Wednesday to Sunday), an average of 20 visitors went to the library each day. Therefore, the total number of visitors from Wednesday to Sunday is \(5 \times 20 = 100\) visitors.

Now, we sum up the visitors for the entire week:
- Monday: 50 visitors
- Tuesday: 100 visitors
- Wednesday to Sunday: 100 visitors

Total visitors = \(50 + 100 + 100 = 250\)

On Monday, the library received 50 visitors.
On Tuesday, the number of visitors was twice that of Monday, which is 2 * 50 = 100 visitors.
For the remaining five days of the week, an average of 20 visitors went to the library each day.
On Monday, the library received a total of 50 visitors.
On Tuesday, the library received a total of 100 visitors.
The total number of visitors for the remaining five days is 5 * 20 = 100.
To get the total number of visitors for the entire week, we sum up all the visitors for each day: 50 + 100 + 100 = 250.

Therefore, the total number of visitors who went to the library that week is 250.

To find the total number of visitors to the library over the week, we need to break down the information given:

1. On Monday, the library received 50 visitors.
2. On Tuesday, the library received twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) visitors.
3. For the remaining days (Wednesday to Sunday), an average of 20 visitors went to the library each day.

Let's first calculate the total number of visitors for the remaining 5 days:
\[ \text{Visitors per day} = 20 \]
\[ \text{Number of days} = 5 \]
\[ \text{Total for remaining days} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \]

Now, let's sum up the visitors from each day of the week:
\[ \text{Monday} = 50 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 100 \]
\[ \text{Remaining days} = 100 \]

So, the total number of visitors for the whole week is:
\[ \text{Total visitors} = 50 + 100 + 100 = 250 \]

Let's calculate the number of visitors for each day of the week:

- On Monday, the library received 50 visitors.
- On Tuesday, the number of visitors is twice that of Monday, so the library received \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) visitors.
- The remaining days (Wednesday to Sunday) each have an average of 20 visitors per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of visitors for Wednesday to Sunday:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ visitors} \]

Now, we'll sum up all the visitors:
- Monday: 50 visitors
- Tuesday: 100 visitors
- Wednesday to Sunday: 60 visitors

Total visitors: \( 50 + 100 + 60 \)

Let's add these together:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \]
\[ 150 + 60 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of visitors who went to the library that week is 210.

First, we need to determine the number of visitors on Tuesday. The library received twice the number of visitors on Tuesday compared to Monday. So, on Tuesday, the library received \(2 \times 50 = 100\) visitors. 

Next, we know the average number of visitors on the remaining days of the week, excluding Monday and Tuesday, is 20. Assuming there are 5 remaining days in the week, the total number of visitors for these days would be \(20 \times 5 = 100\).

Now, we can calculate the total number of visitors for the entire week by summing the visitors from Monday, Tuesday, and the remaining days: \(50 + 100 + 100 = 250\).

So, the total number of visitors who went to the library that week is 250.

To find the total number of visitors to the library that week, we can break the problem down as follows:

1. **Visitors on Monday**: The library received 50 visitors.

2. **Visitors on Tuesday**: The library received twice the number of visitors on Tuesday compared to Monday. Therefore, the number of visitors on Tuesday is \(2 \times 50 = 100\).

3. **Remaining days of the week (Wednesday to Sunday)**: The average number of visitors on these days is 20. Since there are 5 days from Wednesday to Sunday, the total number of visitors over these days is \(5 \times 20 = 100\).

4. **Total visitors for the week**: Adding the visitors from Monday, Tuesday, and the remaining days gives \(50 + 100 + 100 = 250\).

Therefore, the total number of visitors who went to the library that week is 250.

2. On Tuesday, the library received twice that number, which means \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) visitors.
3. On the remaining days (Wednesday through Sunday), the library averaged 20 visitors each day.

Adding these together:

Total visitors = 50 + 100 + 100 = 250

On Monday, the library received 50 visitors. On Tuesday, the library received twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) visitors. On the remaining days of the week, an average of 20 visitors went to the library each day. There are 4 remaining days in the week (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday). Therefore, the total number of visitors for these 4 days is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) visitors.

To find the total number of visitors for the entire week, we add the visitors from each day:
- Monday: 50 visitors
- Tuesday: 100 visitors
- Wednesday through Saturday: 80 visitors each day

Total visitors = 50 + 100 + 80 + 80 + 80

Let's break down the number of visitors for each day:

- Monday: 50 visitors

- Tuesday: Twice the number of Monday
  \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) visitors

- Remaining days: 5 days

For the remaining 5 days, an average of 20 visitors went to the library each day. So for 5 days, it would be:
\( 5 \times 20 = 100 \) visitors

Now we can sum up the total number of visitors:

\( 50 \text{ (Monday)} + 100 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 100 \text{ (remaining days)} = 250 \) visitors

Therefore, the total number of visitors who went to the library that week is 250.
