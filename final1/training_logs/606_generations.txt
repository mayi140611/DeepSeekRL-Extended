system
Sandy has 1,000,000 tokens in total. She wants to keep half of them for herself, which is \( \frac{1,000,000}{2} = 500,000 \) tokens. The remaining tokens to be divided among her 4 siblings are \( 1,000,000 - 500,000 = 500,000 \) tokens.

There are 4 siblings, so each of them will receive \( \frac{500,000}{4} = 125,000 \) tokens.

Sandy has 500,000 tokens, and each sibling has 125,000 tokens. To find out how many more tokens Sandy has than any of her siblings, we calculate \( 500,000 - 125,000 = 375,000 \).

Therefore, Sandy will have 375,000 more tokens than any of her siblings.

system
Sandy has 1 million Safe Moon tokens. She wants to keep half of them to herself, so she retains \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1,000,000 = 500,000 \) tokens. This leaves her with \( 1,000,000 - 500,000 = 500,000 \) tokens to divide equally among her 4 siblings.

Each sibling gets \( \frac{500,000}{4} = 125,000 \) tokens. Sandy originally had 500,000 tokens, while each sibling ends up with 125,000 tokens. Therefore, Sandy has \( 500,000 - 125,000 \times 4 = 500,000 - 500,000 = 0 \) more tokens than any of her siblings.

Sandy bought 1 million tokens, which is 1,000,000 tokens. She wants to keep half of them to herself, so she keeps:

\[ \frac{1,000,000}{2} = 500,000 \text{ tokens} \]

The remaining tokens after she keeps half are:

\[ 1,000,000 - 500,000 = 500,000 \text{ tokens} \]

She intends to divide these remaining tokens equally among her 4 siblings. So, each sibling will receive:

\[ \frac{500,000}{4} = 125,000 \text{ tokens} \]

Now, we need to compare how many tokens Sandy has with how many each sibling gets. Sandy has 500,000 tokens, and each sibling has 125,000 tokens.

Difference in tokens, since Sandy has more:
\[ 500,000 - 125,000 = 375,000 \]

So, Sandy will have 375,000 more tokens than any of her siblings.

Sandy initially has 1 million tokens. She wants to keep half of them for herself, which means she keeps 1/2 * 1,000,000 = 500,000 tokens. 

This leaves 1,000,000 - 500,000 = 500,000 tokens to be divided among her 4 siblings. Each sibling will receive 500,000 / 4 = 125,000 tokens.

Sandy originally had 500,000 tokens, and after keeping half for herself and dividing the rest, she has 500,000 - 500,000 + 125,000 * 4. 

Therefore, Sandy will have 125,000 + 125,000 = 250,000 more tokens than any of her siblings.

Sandy wants to keep half of the 1 million tokens, which is 500,000 tokens for herself. This leaves her with 500,000 tokens to divide among her 4 siblings.

So, to divide the 500,000 tokens among 4 people, each will get:
\[ \frac{500,000}{4} = 125,000 \text{ tokens } \]

Sandy still has:
\[ 500,000 \text{ tokens } - 4 \times 125,000 = 500,000 - 500,000 = 0 \text{ tokens left} \]

This means Sandy doesn't have any tokens left after dividing them evenly among her siblings. 

So, Sandy will have the same number of tokens as any of her siblings - 0 tokens.

Sandy starts with 1,000,000 tokens. She wants to keep half of them, which is 1,000,000 / 2 = 500,000 tokens. This leaves her with 1,000,000 - 500,000 = 500,000 tokens to divide among her 4 siblings.

She will distribute the remaining tokens equally among her 4 siblings, so each sibling will receive 500,000 / 4 = 125,000 tokens.

To find out how many more tokens Sandy will have than any of her siblings, we subtract the number of tokens each sibling gets from the number Sandy keeps:
500,000 - 125,000 = 375,000 tokens.

Therefore, Sandy will have 375,000 more tokens than any of her siblings.

To determine how many more tokens Sandy will have than any of her siblings, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of tokens:**
   Sandy bought 1 million Safe Moon tokens.

2. **Split the tokens between Sandy and her siblings:**
   Sandy wants to keep half of the tokens. So, she keeps:
   \[
   \frac{1,000,000}{2} = 500,000 \text{ tokens}
   \]
   The remaining tokens are split among her 4 siblings:
   \[
   \frac{1,000,000}{2} = 500,000 \text{ tokens}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tokens each sibling receives:**
   Since the remaining 500,000 tokens are divided equally among her 4 siblings:
   \[
   \frac{500,000}{4} = 125,000 \text{ tokens per sibling}
   \]

4. **Calculate the difference in tokens between Sandy and any sibling:**
   Sandy keeps 500,000 tokens, and each sibling receives 125,000 tokens. The difference is:
   \[
   500,000 - 125,000 = 375,000 \text{ tokens}
   \]

So, Sandy will have 375,000 more tokens than any of her siblings.

Sandy bought 1 million Safe Moon tokens. She wants to keep half of them for herself, so she keeps:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ million}}{2} = 500,000 \text{ tokens} \]

This means she has 500,000 tokens left to divide among her 4 siblings. Each sibling will receive:

\[ \frac{500,000 \text{ tokens}}{4} = 125,000 \text{ tokens} \]

Sandy now has 500,000 tokens, and each sibling has 125,000 tokens. The difference between the number of tokens Sandy has and the number her siblings have is:

\[ 500,000 - 125,000 = 375,000 \text{ tokens} \]

To determine how many more tokens Sandy will have than any of her siblings, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total tokens Sandy bought:**
   \[
   1,000,000 \text{ tokens}
   \]

2. **Tokens Sandy wants to keep to herself:**
   \[
   \frac{1,000,000}{2} = 500,000 \text{ tokens}
   \]

3. **Tokens to be divided among her 4 siblings:**
   \[
   \text{Total tokens} - \text{tokens Sandy keeps} = 1,000,000 - 500,000 = 500,000 \text{ tokens}
   \]

4. **Tokens to be distributed among 4 siblings:**
   \[
   \frac{500,000}{4} = 125,000 \text{ tokens per sibling}
   \]

5. **Difference in tokens between Sandy and any sibling:**
   \[
   500,000 - 125,000 = 375,000 \text{ tokens}
   \]

Therefore, Sandy will have 375,000 more tokens than any of her siblings.

Sandy bought 1 million Safe Moon tokens. She wants to keep half of them to herself, which is:

\[ \frac{1,000,000}{2} = 500,000 \text{ tokens} \text{ for herself.} \]

The remaining tokens to be divided among her 4 siblings is:

So, each sibling will get:

Sandy will have 500,000 tokens and each sibling will have 125,000 tokens. To find out how many more tokens Sandy will have than any of her siblings, we subtract the number of tokens each sibling has from the number of tokens Sandy has:

Sandy has 1 million + 4 = 100004 coins.
She kept 100004 / 2 = 50002 coins for herself.
She had 100004 - 50002 = 50002 coins left.
She divided the 50002 coins among 4 siblings.
So, each sibling got 50002 / 4 = 12500.5 coins.
Thus, Sandy has more coins by 50002 - 12500.5 * 4 = 50002 - 50001 = 1 coin.

Reasoning:
Sandy bought 1 million Safe Moon tokens. She wants to keep half of them to herself, which means she will keep \( \frac{1,000,000}{2} = 500,000 \) tokens. The remaining tokens that she needs to divide among her 4 siblings are also 1 million tokens. When she divides these tokens equally among her siblings, each sibling will receive \( \frac{1,000,000}{4} = 250,000 \) tokens. To find out how many more tokens Sandy will have than any of her siblings, we subtract the tokens each sibling has from the tokens Sandy has, which gives us \( 500,000 - 250,000 = 250,000 \).

Therefore, Sandy will have 250,000 more tokens than any of her siblings.

Sandy has 1 million Safe Moon tokens and wants to keep half, which is 500,000 tokens for herself, leaving 500,000 tokens to be divided among her 4 siblings.

After dividing the remaining tokens, each sibling will get:

\[500,000 \div 4 = 125,000\]

Sandy originally had 500,000 tokens. So she will have:

\[500,000 + 125,000 = 625,000\]

Sandy has 625,000 tokens, and each sibling will have 125,000 tokens. To find how many more tokens Sandy has than any sibling:

\[625,000 - 125,000 = 500,000\]
