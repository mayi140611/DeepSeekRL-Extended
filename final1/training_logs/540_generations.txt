To determine how many lego sets Tonya buys for her older sister, we need to ensure that she spends the exact same amount on each sister. 

1. First, calculate the total amount Tonya spent on her younger sister's gifts:
   - She bought 4 dolls.
   - Each doll costs $15.
   - Total cost for dolls for the younger sister = \( 4 \times 15 = 60 \) dollars.

2. Since Tonya wants to spend the same amount on her older sister, she needs to spend $60 on lego sets for the older sister.

3. Each lego set costs $20.

4. To find out how many lego sets her older sister receives, divide the total amount by the cost per lego set:
   \[
   \frac{60}{20} = 3
   \]

Therefore, Tonya buys 3 lego sets for her older sister.

The younger sister's gift costs 4 dolls * $15/doll = $60.
She buys each of her sisters the same amount, so each sister's gift costs 60/2 = $30.
The older sister's Lego sets cost $20 each, so she buys 30/20 = 1.5 Lego sets.
Since she cannot buy half Lego sets, she buys 1 Lego set for the older sister.

Tonya has 2 sisters and wants to spend the exact same amount on each. She spends $15 x 4 dolls = $60 on the dolls for her younger sister.

Since she wants to spend the exact same amount on each sister, she can spend the remaining amount on the lego sets.

So, she spends $60 - $60 = $0 left on lego sets.

Since each lego set costs $20, she can buy $0 ÷ $20 = 0 lego sets.

To determine how many Lego sets Tonya buys for her older sister, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Tonya spends on the dolls.
2. Determine the amount of money she plans to spend on each sister.
3. Calculate the total cost of Lego sets needed for the older sister.
4. Determine how many Lego sets she can buy with the planned amount of money.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on dolls.
Tonya buys 4 dolls, each costing $15.
\[ \text{Total cost of dolls} = 4 \times 15 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine the amount of money spent on each sister.
Since Tonya wants to spend the exact same amount on each sister, she will spend:
\[ \text{Amount per sister} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of Lego sets for the older sister.
Let \( x \) be the number of Lego sets she buys for the older sister.
\[ \text{Total cost of Lego sets} = 20x \text{ dollars} \]
Since this cost is the same as what she spent on dolls for her younger sister:
\[ 20x = 60 \]

Step 4: Determine how many Lego sets she can buy.
Divide the total amount spent on dolls by the cost per Lego set.
\[ x = \frac{60}{20} = 3 \]

Therefore, Tonya buys 3 Lego sets for her older sister.

First, we calculate the total cost of the dolls Tonya bought for her younger sister. Since each doll costs $15 and she bought 4 dolls, the total cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ dolls} \times \$15 \text{ per doll} = \$60 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Tonya has left after buying the dolls. Since she is spending the exact same amount on each sister, and each sister gets $60, she has:
\[ 2 \times \$60 = \$120 \]

Now, we need to determine how many lego sets she can buy with the remaining $120. Each lego set costs $20, so the number of lego sets she can buy is:
\[ \frac{\$120}{\$20 \text{ per lego set}} = 6 \text{ lego sets} \]

Therefore, Tonya buys 6 lego sets for her older sister.

To determine how many Lego sets Tonya buys, we need to first calculate the total amount she spends on the dolls for her younger sister. Since she has 2 dolls and each doll costs $15, we multiply:

\[ 2 \text{ dolls} \times 15 \text{ dollars per doll} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Tonya wants to spend the same amount on each sister, so she will also spend $30 on Lego sets for her older sister. Since each Lego set costs $20, we divide the total amount she wants to spend on Lego sets by the cost of each set:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \div 20 \text{ dollars per set} = 1.5 \text{ sets} \]

Since Tonya can't buy half a Lego set, she will round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Tonya buys 1 Lego set for her older sister.

Tonya spends the exact same amount on each sister, so she spends $15 \times 2 = $30 on her younger sister's dolls.

She plans to buy lego sets for her older sister, which cost $20 each. To spend the same amount, she buys lego sets for her older sister, thus:

$30 = $20 \times \text{number of lego sets}

Then:

\# Lego Sets = $30 \div $20 = 1

Thus, she buys 1 lego set for her older sister.

To determine how many Lego sets Tonya buys for her older sister, we first need to calculate the total amount Tonya spends on her younger sister's dolls.

The cost of one doll is $15, and she buys 4 dolls, so:
\[
15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Tonya wants to spend the exact same amount on each of her sisters, the total amount she spends on both sisters is:
\[
60 + 60 = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Each Lego set costs $20. To find out how many Lego sets she can buy, we divide the total amount by the cost of one Lego set:
\[
\frac{120}{20} = 6

Therefore, Tonya buys 6 Lego sets for her older sister.
