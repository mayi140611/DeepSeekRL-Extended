system
To determine how many more tickets Jeanne needs, we first calculate the total number of tickets required for all the rides she wants to go on.

1. Ferris wheel: 5 tickets
2. Roller coaster: 4 tickets
3. Bumper cars: 4 tickets

Total tickets needed = 5 + 4 + 4 = 13 tickets

Jeanne currently has 5 tickets. To find out how many more tickets she needs, we subtract the number of tickets she has from the total number of tickets required:

Additional tickets needed = Total tickets required - Tickets Jeanne has
Additional tickets needed = 13 - 5 = 8 tickets

Therefore, Jeanne should buy 8 more tickets.

Jeanne wants to ride three attractions: the Ferris wheel, the roller coaster, and the bumper cars. 

- The Ferris wheel costs 5 tickets.
- The roller coaster costs 4 tickets.
- The bumper cars also cost 4 tickets.

So, in total, Jeanne needs:
5 tickets (Ferris wheel) + 4 tickets (roller coaster) + 4 tickets (bumper cars) = 13 tickets.

Jeanne currently has 5 tickets. To find out how many more tickets Jeanne needs to buy, we subtract the tickets she already has from the total tickets needed:

13 tickets (total needed) - 5 tickets (already has) = 8 tickets (more tickets needed).

Therefore, Jeanne should buy 8 more tickets.
