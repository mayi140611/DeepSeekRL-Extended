###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Every day, Sara bakes 10 cakes and puts them in his refrigerator. He does this for 5 days. Carol then comes over and eats 12 of his cakes. If it takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake, how many cans of frosting does Bob need to frost the remaining cakes?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Sara bakes 10 cakes every day for 5 days, so the total number of cakes baked is:
\[ 10 \, \text{cakes/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 50 \, \text{cakes} \]

Carol eats 12 of these cakes, so the number of cakes remaining is:
\[ 50 \, \text{cakes} - 12 \, \text{cakes} = 38 \, \text{cakes} \]

It takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake, so the total number of cans of frosting needed for the remaining 38 cakes is:
\[ 38 \, \text{cakes} \times 2 \, \text{cans/cake} = 76 \, \text{cans} \]

First, we calculate the total number of cakes Sara bakes over the 5 days:

\[ 10 \text{ cakes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ cakes} \]

Next, we account for the 12 cakes that Carol eats:

\[ 50 \text{ cakes} - 12 \text{ cakes} = 38 \text{ cakes} \]

Now, if it takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake, we calculate the total number of cans needed for the remaining 38 cakes:

\[ 38 \text{ cakes} \times 2 \text{ cans/cake} = 76 \text{ cans} \]

So, Bob needs 76 cans of frosting to frost the remaining cakes.

First, let's calculate the total number of cakes Sara bakes:

Then, Carol eats 12 of these cakes:

\[ 50 \, \text{cakes} - 12 \, \text{cakes} = 38 \, \text{cakes} \]

Since it takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake, the total number of cans needed to frost the remaining cakes is:

To find out how many cans of frosting Bob needs to frost the remaining cakes, first, we need to calculate the total number of cakes baked by Sara. Since he bakes 10 cakes each day for 5 days, the total number of cakes is:

\[ 10 \text{ cakes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ cakes} \]

Next, Carol eats 12 cakes, so the number of cakes left is:

\[ 50 \text{ cakes} - 12 \text{ cakes} = 38 \text{ cakes} \]

Since each cake requires 2 cans of frosting, the total number of cans needed to frost the remaining cakes is:

\[ 38 \text{ cakes} \times 2 \text{ cans/cake} = 76 \text{ cans} \]

So, Bob needs 76 cans of frosting to frost the remaining cakes.

First, we need to determine the total number of cakes Sara baked. Since Sara bakes 10 cakes every day for 5 days, the total number of cakes is:
\[ 10 \text{ cakes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ cakes} \]

When Carol comes over and eats 12 cakes, the number of remaining cakes is:
\[ 50 \text{ cakes} - 12 \text{ cakes eaten} = 38 \text{ cakes} \]

Since it takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake, the total number of cans of frosting needed to frost the remaining cakes is:

To find out how many cakes Sara has baked over 5 days, we multiply the number of cakes he bakes each day by the number of days: 10 cakes/day * 5 days = 50 cakes.

Carol eats 12 cakes, so the number of remaining cakes is 50 - 12 = 38 cakes.

To find out how many cans of frosting are needed to frost the remaining cakes, we multiply the number of remaining cakes by the number of cans needed per cake: 38 cakes * 2 cans/cake = 76 cans.

To determine how many cans of frosting Bob needs, we'll start by calculating the total number of cakes Sara bakes.

Sara bakes 10 cakes each day for 5 days, so:
\[ 10 \text{ cakes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ cakes} \]

After 5 days, Carol eats 12 of these cakes, so:
\[ 50 \text{ cakes} - 12 \text{ cakes} = 38 \text{ cakes} \]

Since it takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake, we need to calculate the total cans of frosting required to frost these remaining 38 cakes.
\[ 38 \text{ cakes} \times 2 \text{ cans/cake} = 76 \text{ cans} \]

Therefore, Bob needs 76 cans of frosting to frost the remaining cakes.

To determine how many cans of frosting Bob needs, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cakes Sara bakes.
2. Determine the number of cakes left after Carol eats some.
3. Find out how many cakes need to be frosted.
4. Calculate the total number of cans of frosting needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cakes Sara bakes.
Sara bakes 10 cakes every day for 5 days.
\[ 10 \text{ cakes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ cakes} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of cakes left after Carol eats some.
Carol eats 12 cakes.
\[ 50 \text{ cakes} - 12 \text{ cakes} = 38 \text{ cakes} \]

Step 3: Find out how many cakes need to be frosted.
Since Bob needs to frost all the remaining cakes, he needs to frost 38 cakes.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cans of frosting needed.
Each cake requires 2 cans of frosting.
\[ 38 \text{ cakes} \times 2 \text{ cans/cake} = 76 \text{ cans} \]

Therefore, Bob needs 76 cans of frosting to frost the remaining cakes.
