1. First, we determine how many strawberries Matthew picked. Since Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, and Betty picked 16 strawberries, Matthew picked \(16 + 20 = 36\) strawberries.
2. Matthew also picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. Thus, if Natalie picked \(n\) strawberries, then Matthew picked \(2n\) strawberries. Since Matthew picked 36 strawberries, we have \(2n = 36\), which implies \(n = 18\). So, Natalie picked 18 strawberries.
3. Now, we find the total number of strawberries picked by Betty, Matthew, and Natalie: \(16 + 36 + 18 = 70\) strawberries.
4. Next, we calculate the number of jars of jam they can make. Since one jar of jam uses 7 strawberries, the number of jars they can make is \(70 \div 7 = 10\) jars.
5. Finally, they sold each jar at $4. Thus, the total money made from the jars of jam is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

First, we need to determine the number of strawberries each person picked. 

Betty picked 16 strawberries.
Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, which is \(16 + 20 = 36\) strawberries.
Matthew also picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie, so Natalie picked \(36 / 2 = 18\) strawberries.

Next, we calculate the total number of strawberries picked:
- Betty: 16 strawberries
- Matthew: 36 strawberries
- Natalie: 18 strawberries

The total number of strawberries is \(16 + 36 + 18 = 70\) strawberries.

Each jar of jam uses 7 strawberries, so the number of jars of jam they can make is \(70 / 7 = 10\) jars.

Since they sold each jar at $4, the total money made from selling the jars is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, they were able to make $40 from the strawberries they picked.

First, let's determine how many strawberries Matthew picked. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty. Since Betty picked 16 strawberries, Matthew picked \(16 + 20 = 36\) strawberries.

Next, we need to find out how many strawberries Natalie picked. Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. So Natalie picked \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) strawberries.

Now, let's sum up the total number of strawberries picked by Betty, Matthew, and Natalie. Betty picked 16 strawberries, Matthew picked 36 strawberries, and Natalie picked 18 strawberries. Adding these together gives a total of \(16 + 36 + 18 = 70\) strawberries.

One jar of jam uses 7 strawberries. Therefore, the number of jars they can make is \( \frac{70}{7} = 10 \) jars.

Each jar of jam is sold at $4. So the total money made from the strawberries they picked is \( 10 \times 4 = 40 \) dollars.

1. Betty picked 16 strawberries.

2. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, so:
   \( 16 + 20 = 36 \) strawberries.

3. Matthew also picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie, so:
   \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \) strawberries.

4. In total, they picked:
   \( 16 + 36 + 32 = 84 \) strawberries.

5. To find out how many jars of jam they can make, divide the total number of strawberries by 7:
   \( 84 \div 7 = 12 \) jars.

6. Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so:
   \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) dollars.

Therefore, they were able to make $48 from the strawberries they picked.

Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Betty picked 16 strawberries.
2. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty:
   Matthew picked = Betty's strawberries + 20
   Matthew picked = 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries
3. Matthew also picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. To find out the number of strawberries Natalie picked:
   Natalie's strawberries = Matthew's strawberries / 2
   Natalie's strawberries = 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries

Now, let's add up the total number of strawberries picked:
Total strawberries = Betty's strawberries + Matthew's strawberries + Natalie's strawberries
Total strawberries = 16 + 36 + 18 = 60 strawberries

One jar of jam uses 7 strawberries. To find out how many jars they made:
Number of jars = Total strawberries / Strawberries per jar
Number of jars = 60 / 7 = 8.57 jars (since they can't sell a fraction of a jar, they would only have enough to make 8 jars)

Each jar is sold at $4. To find out how much money they made:
Total money made = Number of jars × Price per jar
Total money made = 8 × 4 = $32

So, they were able to make $32 from the strawberries they picked.

First, let's determine how many strawberries Matthew picked. Since Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, and Betty picked 16 strawberries, Matthew picked \(16 + 20 = 36\) strawberries.

Next, we know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. Therefore, Natalie picked \(36 / 2 = 18\) strawberries.

Now we know all three have picked different amounts of strawberries: Betty with 16 strawberries, Matthew with 36 strawberries, and Natalie with 18 strawberries. 

Together, they picked \(16 + 36 + 18 = 70\) strawberries. 

One jar of jam used 7 strawberries. So, they could make \(70 / 7 = 10\) jars of jam.

Each jar was sold at $4, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars was \(10 \times 4 = \$40\).

Thus, they were able to make \$40 from the strawberries they picked.

1. First, determine how many strawberries Matthew picked. Given that Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie, we can calculate this as follows:
   - Natalie picked \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) strawberries.
   - Matthew picked \( 16 + 20 = 36 \) strawberries.

2. Calculate the total number of strawberries picked by Betty, Matthew, and Natalie:
   - Betty picked 16 strawberries,
   - Matthew picked 36 strawberries,
   - Natalie picked 8 strawberries.

   Therefore, the total number of strawberries is:
   \[
   16 + 36 + 8 = 60 \text{ strawberries}
   \]

3. Determine how many jars of jam they can make, with each jar using 7 strawberries:
   \[
   \frac{60}{7} = 8.57 \text{ (which needs to be rounded down to 8 jars)}
   \]

4. Calculate the total revenue from selling these jars of jam:
   - Each jar is sold for $4, 
   - Therefore, the total revenue is:
   \[
   8 \text{ jars} \times 4 \text{ dollars/jar} = 32 \text{ dollars}

First, we need to determine how many strawberries Matthew picked. Since Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie, we can start by calculating Natalie's strawberries. Let's denote the number of strawberries Natalie picked as \( N \). Matthew picked \( 2N \) strawberries, and Betty picked 16 strawberries. According to the problem:
\[ 2N = 16 + 20 \]
\[ 2N = 36 \]
\[ N = 18 \]
So, Natalie picked 18 strawberries.

Next, we find out how many strawberries Matthew picked:
\[ 2N = 2 \times 18 = 36 \]
So, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.

To find out how many strawberries were used to make jam, we sum up the strawberries picked by Betty, Matthew, and Natalie:
\[ 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 \]
Therefore, they used 70 strawberries to make jam.

Since each jar of jam used 7 strawberries, we can calculate the number of jars they made:
\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]
So, they made 10 jars of jam.

Lastly, they sold each jar of jam at $4, so we calculate their total revenue:
\[ 10 \times 4 = \$40 \]

Therefore, they were able to make $40 from the strawberries they picked.
