###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?

system
The 20 minutes Janice typed 20 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 120 sentences.
She typed an additional 15 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 90 sentences.
Janice typed a total of 210 sentences so far, minus the 40 she had to erase, leaving 210 - 40 = 170 sentences.
Janice typed an additional 18 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 108 sentences.
So in total, she typed 170 + 108 = 278 sentences today.
By the end of today, Janice had 536 sentences already, so the paper started with 536 - 278 = 258 sentences.

Let's calculate the total number of sentences Janice typed today:
1. She typed 20 minutes at a rate of 6 sentences per minute: 
   20 * 6 = 120 sentences
2. She then typed for an additional 15 minutes:
   15 * 6 = 90 sentences
3. She had to erase 40 sentences, so we subtract them:
   Total sentences typed: 120 + 90 - 40 = 170 sentences
4. After the meeting, she typed for 18 more minutes:
   18 * 6 = 108 sentences
5. Adding all the sentences together:
   Total sentences = 170 + 108 = 278 sentences

Now, let's find out how many sentences she started with:
Given that the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today, we subtract the total sentences she typed today from the final count:
Starting sentences = 536 - 278 = 258 sentences

Therefore, she started with 258 sentences today.

Janice typed for 20 minutes initially, which is \( 20 \times 6 = 120 \) sentences.

She then typed for 15 minutes longer, which is an additional \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) sentences. So, the total from typing without breaks is \( 120 + 90 = 300 \) sentences.

After erasing 40 sentences, she had 300 - 40 = 260 sentences left.

She then typed for 18 more minutes, adding \( 18 \times 6 = 108 \) sentences. So the total from typing without breaks plus the last typing session is \( 260 + 108 = 368 \) sentences.

By the end of today, Janice had 536 sentences, which means she started with \( 536 - 368 = 168 \) sentences today.

To determine how many sentences Janice started with today, we need to calculate the total number of sentences she typed today and then subtract this from the total number of sentences in the paper to find the starting number.

First, calculate the total time Janice typed today:
- She typed for 20 minutes initially,
- Then she typed for 15 minutes more,
- Then she typed for 18 minutes after a meeting.

Total typing time = 20 + 15 + 18 = 53 minutes.

Next, calculate the total number of sentences she typed today:
- She types at a rate of 6 sentences per minute,
- So, the total number of sentences typed today is 53 minutes * 6 sentences per minute = 318 sentences.

Now, subtract the number of sentences erased from the total number of sentences typed:
- She erased 40 sentences,
- So, the number of sentences remaining after erasing is 318 - 40 = 278 sentences.

Finally, subtract the number of sentences remaining after erasing from the total number of sentences in the paper to find the starting number:
- The paper had 536 sentences at the end of today,
- So, the starting number of sentences is 536 - 278 = 258 sentences.

Therefore, Janice started with 258 sentences today.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Janice spent typing today:

She typed for 20 minutes initially.
Then she typed for 15 minutes.
She typed for an additional 18 minutes after a meeting.

Total typing time = 20 + 15 + 18 = 53 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total number of sentences she typed during these 53 minutes:

Since she can type 6 sentences per minute, the total number of sentences she typed today is:

Total sentences typed = 53 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 318 sentences.

She had to erase 40 sentences, which means she actually added those back, so:

Actual sentences added during typing = 318 sentences (typed today) - 40 sentences (erased incorrectly) = 318 - 40 = 278 sentences.

Now, to find out how many sentences she started with today, we subtract the number of sentences she erased:

Sentences started with = Actual sentences added + Sentences erased - Sentences erased (since she added those back)

However, since the 40 sentences she erased are subtracted already in the "sentences erased" total, which is the ones that she actually lost due to erasing:

Therefore, if we were to directly find out how many sentences she started with, it would be the total number of sentences at the end (536 sentences) minus the sentences she typed but later erased (40 sentences):

Sentences started with today = 536 sentences (total) - 40 sentences (erased) = 496 sentences.

So, Janice started with 496 sentences today.

The total time Janice spent typing today, subtracting the break and meeting times, is 20 + 15 + 18 = 53 minutes. She typed 6*53 = 318 sentences before erasing 40 sentences. Therefore, she started with 318 + 40 = 358 sentences.

<answer>
358
</answer>
<br> 

I believe this is a straightforward arithmetic problem that can be solved step-by-step:

1. First, we calculate the total time Janice spent typing today. She spent:
   - 20 minutes typing
   - After a break, another 15 minutes
   - Then after an additional meeting, an additional 18 minutes

2. Adding these times together, we get:
   20 + 15 + 18 = 53 minutes

3. She typed at a rate of 6 sentences per minute, so over the 53 minutes, she typed:
   6 sentences/minute * 53 minutes = 318 sentences

4. After erasing 40 sentences, the number of sentences left is:
   318 sentences - 40 sentences = 278 sentences

5. Adding the 40 sentences lost due to erasing, the total number of sentences she started with today is:
   278 sentences + 40 sentences = 358 sentences

Therefore, Janice started with 358 sentences today.

To determine how many sentences Janice started with today, we need to calculate the total number of sentences she typed today and then account for the sentences she erased.

First, let's calculate the total number of sentences Janice typed today.

1. She typed for 20 minutes at a rate of 6 sentences per minute.
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 120 \text{ sentences}
   \]

2. She took a break and typed 15 minutes more. Since the problem does not specify a rate for these minutes, we assume she typed at the same rate of 6 sentences per minute for the 15 minutes.
   \[
   15 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 90 \text{ sentences}
   \]

3. After a meeting, she typed for an additional 18 minutes. Again, assuming she typed at the same rate of 6 sentences per minute for the 18 minutes.
   \[
   18 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 108 \text{ sentences}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the sentences she typed today:
\[
120 \text{ sentences} + 90 \text{ sentences} + 108 \text{ sentences} = 318 \text{ sentences}
\]

Now, we need to account for the sentences she erased. She erased 40 sentences from the total she would have if she had not erased any.

\[
318 \text{ sentences} - 40 \text{ sentences} = 278 \text{ sentences}
\]

Since this is the number of sentences she would have had without erasing any, and the final total number of sentences is 536, we can find out how many sentences she started with today by subtracting this number from the final total:
\[
536 \text{ sentences} - 278 \text{ sentences} = 258 \text{ sentences}
\]

Thus, Janice started with \boxed{258} sentences today.

Let's break down the information given:
- Janice can type 6 sentences per minute.
- She typed for 20 minutes initially.
- She then typed for 15 minutes longer, which is a total of 35 minutes.
- She had to erase 40 sentences.
- After all her typing, she had 536 sentences by the end of the day.

Calculating the total sentences she typed:
- For an initial 20 minutes: 20 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 120 sentences.
- For a second 35 minutes: 35 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 210 sentences.
- After erasing 40 sentences: 210 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences.

Adding these totals gives us the difference:
120 sentences + 210 sentences = 330 sentences.

Since the final count was 536 sentences, subtract this difference to find how many sentences she started with:
536 sentences - 330 sentences = 206 sentences.

So, she started with 206 sentences today.

To determine how many sentences Janice started with today, let's calculate the total number of sentences she typed during the day, considering she had to erase some.

1. **Typing period without breaks and meetings:**
   - Janice typed for 20 minutes at 6 sentences per minute.
   - Total sentences without breaks = \( 20 \times 6 = 120 \).

   - She then typed for 15 more minutes.
   - Total sentences without breaks + meetings = \( 120 + (15 \times 6) = 120 + 90 = 210 \).

2. **Erase incorrect sentences:**
   - She erased 40 sentences.
   - Remaining sentences = \( 210 - 40 = 170 \).

3. **Additional typing period:**
   - Janice then typed for 18 more minutes.
   - Total sentences after meetings and additional typing = \( 170 + (18 \times 6) = 170 + 108 = 278 \).

Janice typed a total of 278 sentences. However, the question states that the paper "had 536 sentences by the end of today." This indicates that there might be a discrepancy between the problem's context and the provided information. Since the problem explicitly states the total number of sentences at the end, we should use that number to find out how many sentences she started with today.

To find the number of sentences she started with today, subtract the total sentences typed today from the final number of sentences.

1. Sentences typed today = 278.
2. Final number of sentences = 536.

Number of sentences she started with today = Final number of sentences - Sentences typed today = \( 536 - 278 = 258 \).

Therefore, Janice started with 258 sentences today.

To find out how many sentences Janice started with today, let's calculate the total number of sentences she typed throughout the day and then subtract the number of sentences she erased.

First, calculate the sentences typed in the initial 20 minutes of work:
\[20 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences per minute} = 120 \text{ sentences}\]

Then, add the 15 minutes of additional typing:
\[120 \text{ sentences} + (15 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences per minute}) = 120 \text{ sentences} + 90 \text{ sentences} = 210 \text{ sentences}\]

Next, add the sentences typed after the meeting:
\[210 \text{ sentences} + (18 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences per minute}) = 210 \text{ sentences} + 108 \text{ sentences} = 318 \text{ sentences}\]

Janice then erased 40 sentences, so subtract these from the total:
\[318 \text{ sentences} - 40 \text{ sentences} = 278 \text{ sentences}\]

By the end of the day, the paper had 536 sentences. To find out how many sentences Janice started with, subtract the total number of sentences typed from the end of the day:
\[536 \text{ sentences} - 278 \text{ sentences} = 258 \text{ sentences}\]

Therefore, Janice started with 258 sentences today.

First, we need to calculate how many sentences Janice typed in total today. She typed for 20 minutes, then continued for another 15 minutes, and finally for 18 more minutes. This totals to 20 + 15 + 18 = 53 minutes. Since she types 6 sentences per minute, the total number of sentences she typed today is 53 * 6 = 318 sentences.

Next, we need to recalculate the number of sentences she typed after the additional time she spent erasing. Since she erased 40 sentences, we subtract this from the total she typed today: 318 - 40 = 278 sentences.

Finally, we need to find out how many sentences were in the paper at the beginning of today. We know that by the end of today, the paper had 536 sentences. If we subtract the number of sentences she typed today (after the 40 sentences were erased), we get the number of sentences she started with: 536 - 278 = 258 sentences.

Let's calculate the total sentences Janice typed in today:

1. First, calculate the time she spent typing: 20 minutes + 15 minutes = 35 minutes.
2. At 6 sentences per minute, she typed 35 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 210 sentences.
3. After typing, she had to erase 40 sentences, so she effectively typed 210 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences today.

Now, let's set up an equation to find out how many sentences she started with today:

Final sentences (536) = Sentences typed today (170) + Sentences she started with (X)

So, 536 = 170 + X

Now, let's solve for X:

536 - 170 = X

1. Janice types at a rate of 6 sentences per minute.
2. She typed for 20 minutes initially.
3. She took a break and typed for an additional 15 minutes.
4. She then erased 40 sentences.
5. After that, she typed for 18 more minutes.

Let's calculate the total number of sentences she typed throughout the day:

- Initial typing: \(20 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 120 \text{ sentences}\)
- Follow-up typing: \(15 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 90 \text{ sentences}\)
- After meeting, typing: \(18 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 108 \text{ sentences}\)

Subtract the 40 sentences she had to erase:
\[120 + 90 + 108 - 40 = 278 \text{ sentences}\]

Now, let's determine how many sentences she started with:

Total sentences at the end of the day: 536 sentences
Sentences typed today: 278 sentences

To determine how many sentences Janice started with today, we need to calculate the total number of sentences she typed today and then subtract the sentences she had to erase.

First, we calculate the number of sentences she typed in the first period:
\[ 6 \text{ sentences/minute} \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ sentences} \]

Next, we calculate the number of sentences she typed in the second period:
\[ 6 \text{ sentences/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ sentences} \]

Then, we calculate the number of sentences she typed in the third period:
\[ 6 \text{ sentences/minute} \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ sentences} \]

Now, we sum the sentences she typed in all three periods:
\[ 120 \text{ sentences} + 90 \text{ sentences} + 108 \text{ sentences} = 318 \text{ sentences} \]

Since she had to erase 40 sentences, we subtract these from the total number of sentences she typed:
\[ 318 \text{ sentences} - 40 \text{ sentences} = 278 \text{ sentences} \]

Therefore, Janice started with today's paper with 278 sentences.

- After her break, she continued typing for 18 minutes: \(18 \times 6 = 108\) sentences.

Let's sum these sentences up to get the total number of sentences she typed today before erasing any sentences.

Total sentences typed today = \(120 + 90 + 108 = 318\) sentences.

She then erased 40 sentences, so we subtract that from the total to find out how many she started with today:
