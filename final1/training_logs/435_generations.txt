system
Given that Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens, and that she originally had 60 pens, she also had 60 pencils. She then gave 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her seven friends. Let's calculate the total number of pens and pencils given to her friends.

Total pens given = \(8 \times 7 = 56\)
Total pencils given = \(6 \times 7 = 42\)

Now, let's subtract the pens and pencils given to her friends from the original amounts:

Pens left = \(60 - 56 = 4\)
Pencils left = \(60 - 42 = 18\)

Total number of pens and pencils left = \(4 + 18 = 22\)

Initially, Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens. Since she had 60 pens, she also had 60 pencils.

She gave 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends. The total number of pens given away is \(8 \times 7 = 56\), and the total number of pencils given away is \(6 \times 7 = 42\).

After giving away the pens and pencils, the number of pens left is \(60 - 56 = 4\), and the number of pencils left is \(60 - 42 = 18\).

The total number of pens and pencils left is \(4 + 18 = 22\).

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the number of pencils and pens Catherine had initially as \( P \). Since she had an equal number of pencils and pens, we have \( P = 60 \).

Next, Catherine gave eight pens and six pencils to each of her seven friends. The number of pens given away is \( 8 \times 7 = 56 \), and the number of pencils given away is \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \).

Therefore, the number of pens left with Catherine is \( 60 - 56 = 4 \), and the number of pencils left with her is \( 60 - 42 = 18 \).

Adding the remaining pens and pencils together, we get \( 4 + 18 = 22 \).

So, Catherine has 22 pens and pencils left.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's start by determining the initial number of pencils and pens Catherine had. Since she had an equal number of pencils and pens, and she had 60 pens, she also had 60 pencils.

Next, we'll calculate how many pens and pencils she gave to her friends. She gave 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends. So, the total number of pens given away is:
\[ 8 \times 7 = 56 \text{ pens} \]
The total number of pencils given away is:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ pencils} \]

To find out how many pens and pencils she had left after giving some to her friends, we subtract the number of pens given away from the initial number of pens:
\[ 60 - 56 = 4 \text{ pens} \]
Similarly, we subtract the number of pencils given away from the initial number of pencils:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ pencils} \]

Adding the pens and pencils she kept, we get:
\[ 4 \text{ pens} + 18 \text{ pencils} = 22 \text{ items} \]

So, the total number of pens and pencils Catherine had left is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]

Therefore, the number of pens left is \(60 - 56 = 4\) and the number of pencils left is \(60 - 42 = 18\).

Therefore, she had \(60 - 56 = 4\) pens left. Similarly, she had \(98 - 42 = 56\) pencils left. Adding the pens and pencils left, she had \(56 + 4 = 60\) items left.

Catherine originally had an equal number of pencils and pens. Since she had 60 pens and she was giving away 8 pens to each of her 7 friends, she gave away \(8 \times 7 = 56\) pens. Therefore, she had \(60 - 56 = 4\) pens left.

Catherine initially had an equal number of pencils and pens, so she also had 56 pencils. She gave away 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends, which totals to \(6 \times 7 = 42\) pencils. Therefore, she had \(56 - 42 = 14\) pencils left.

Adding the pens and pencils she had left, Catherine originally had \(4 + 56 = 60\) pens and pencils.

system
Let's start by determining the total number of pens Catherine had initially. She had 60 pens.

Now, let's calculate how many pens and pencils she gave away. She gave 8 pens to each of her friends, and she has 7 friends. Therefore, the total number of pens given away is:
\[ 8 \text{ pens/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 56 \text{ pens} \]

Similarly, she gave 6 pencils to each of her friends. With 7 friends, the total number of pencils given away is:
\[ 6 \text{ pencils/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 42 \text{ pencils} \]

Initially, Catherine had 60 pens and 60 pencils. After giving away 56 pens and 42 pencils, we can calculate the remaining number of pens and pencils:
\[ \text{Remaining pens} = 60 - 56 = 4 \]
\[ \text{Remaining pencils} = 60 - 42 = 18 \]

The total number of pens and pencils she has left is:
\[ 4 \text{ pens} + 18 \text{ pencils} = 22 \]

So, Catherine has 22 pens and pencils left.

Initially, Catherine had 60 pens and an equal number of pencils, which means she had 60 pencils as well. Therefore, she had a total of \(60 + 60 = 120\) items (pens and pencils combined).

After giving away \(8 \text{ pens} + 6 \text{ pencils} = 14 \text{ items}\) to each of her seven friends, she gave away a total of \(14 \times 7 = 98\) items.

The number of pens left with her is \(60 - 8 = 52\) and the number of pencils left is \(60 - 6 = 54\).

Therefore, she had \(52 + 54 = 106\) items left after giving some away.

#### GENERATION 10 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's first identify the total number of pens and pencils Catherine had initially. Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens, so for both pens and pencils, the total number is:

\[ 60 \, \text{pens} + 60 \, \text{pencils} = 120 \]

Next, we calculate the number of pens and pencils given to her friends. Given that she gave 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends, the total number of pens given away is:

\[ 8 \, \text{pens/friend} \times 7 \, \text{friends} = 56 \, \text{pens} \]

Similarly, the total number of pencils given away is:

\[ 6 \, \text{pencils/friend} \times 7 \, \text{friends} = 42 \, \text{pencils} \]

Now we subtract the number of pens and pencils given away from the total numbers of pens and pencils to find out how many left:

Pens left = \( 60 \, \text{initial pens} - 56 \, \text{given pens} = 4 \, \text{pens} \)
Pencils left = \( 60 \, \text{initial pencils} - 42 \, \text{given pencils} = 18 \, \text{pencils} \)

Finally, we add the pens and pencils left together to get the total:

\[ 4 \, \text{pens} + 18 \, \text{pencils} = 22 \, \text{items} \]

Before giving any pens or pencils to her friends, Catherine had 60 pens + 60 pencils = 120 items.

After giving away 8 pens for each friend, she gave away 8 x 7 = 56 pens.

She was able to give away 6 pencils for each friend, thus giving away 6 x 7 = 42 pencils.

Catherine then has 120 items - 56 pens - 42 pencils = 22 items left.

As Catherine has an equal number of pens as pencils, she had 22 items / 2 = 11 pens and 11 pencils left.

Therefore, the answer is 11 pens and 11 pencils.
