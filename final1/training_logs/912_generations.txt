1. Let Asaf's age be \( A = 50 \) years.
2. Let Alexander's age be \( a \) years.
3. According to the problem, \( A + a = 140 \). Therefore, \( a = 140 - 50 = 90 \) years.
4. The difference of their ages is \( A - a = 50 - 90 = -40 \) years. This value should be half the total number of pencils Asaf has. However, considering the age difference is positive, it's clear there's an error since age difference can't be negative. So, let's revise understanding to mean the age difference between them, not Asaf and Alexander:
5. Let the number of pencils Asaf has be \( p_A \).
6. According to the problem, \( 50 - 90 = -40 = \frac{p_A}{2} \). Therefore, \( p_A = 80 \) pencils.
7. Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, so the number of pencils Alexander has, \( p_A = 80 \) pencils, is indeed \( 80 + 60 = 140 \) pencils.
8. The total number of pencils they have together is \( p_A + p_A = 80 + 140 = 220 \) pencils.

Let's denote Asaf's age as \( A \) and Alexander's age as \( S \). According to the problem, Asaf is 50 years old, so \( A = 50 \). The sum of their ages is 140, so \( A + S = 140 \). Substituting \( A = 50 \) into the equation gives us \( 50 + S = 140 \). Solving for \( S \) yields \( S = 90 \).

The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is \( 90 - 50 = 40 \). According to the problem, this age difference is half the number of pencils Asaf has. Let \( P_A \) be the number of pencils Asaf has. Then, \( 40 = \frac{1}{2}P_A \), from which we find \( P_A = 80 \).

Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, so \( P_S = P_A + 60 = 80 + 60 = 140 \).

The total number of pencils they have together is \( P_A + P_S = 80 + 140 = 220 \).

Asaf's age is given as 50 years. The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. Let's call the number of pencils Asaf has \( A \), and the number of pencils Alexander has \( B \). So, the age difference is \( \frac{A}{2} \).

The sum of their ages is 140, so we have:
\[ 50 + Alexander\, age = 140 \]
\[ Alexander\, age = 140 - 50 = 90 \]

Now, we know Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, so:
\[ B = A + 60 \]

Since the age difference is \( \frac{A}{2} \) and it's half the total pencils, we have:
\[ \frac{A}{2} = \frac{A + 60}{2} \]

From the equation \( \frac{A}{2} + \frac{A}{2} = \frac{A + 60}{2} \), we can conclude:
\[ A = \frac{A + 60}{2} \]
\[ 2A = A + 60 \]
\[ A = 60 \]

So, Asaf has 60 pencils, and Alexander has:
\[ B = 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Adding the pencils together, we get:
\[ A + B = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

The total number of pencils they have together is 180.

1. Given that Asaf is 50 years old and the sum of their ages is 140, we can determine Alexander's age as follows:
   - Sum of their ages: \(50 + \text{Alexander's age} = 140\)
   - Therefore, Alexander's age = \(140 - 50 = 90\) years.

2. Asaf's age difference to Alexander's age is \(90 - 50 = 40\) years.

3. According to the problem, Asaf's age difference to Alexander's age is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. So, this age difference is equal to half the number of pencils:
   - Asaf's age difference = \(0.5 \times (\text{number of pencils Asaf has})\)
   - Thus, the total number of pencils Asaf has is \(40 \times 2 = 80\).

4. Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, so the number of pencils Alexander has is:
   - \(80 + 60 = 140\).

5. The total number of pencils Asaf and Alexander have together is the sum of their individual pencils:
   - \(80 + 140 = 220\).

Therefore, the total number of pencils asaf and Alexander have together is \(220\).

1. Let's denote Asaf's age by \(A\) and Alexander's age by \(X\). We know from the problem that \(A = 50\).

2. The sum of their ages is given as 140:
   \[
   A + X = 140

   Substituting \(A = 50\):
   \[
   50 + X = 140 \implies X = 90

   So, Alexander is 90 years old.

3. The problem states that the age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the total number of pencils Asaf has:
   \[
   |50 - 90| = 40

   This means:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \text{(number of pencils Asaf has)} = 40

Let's denote Asaf's age by \( A \) and Alexander's age by \( B \). According to the problem, Asaf is 50 years old, so \( A = 50 \).

The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. Thus, if \( P_A \) is the number of pencils Asaf has, then:
\[ B - A = \frac{P_A}{2} \]
\[ B - 50 = \frac{P_A}{2} \]
\[ B = 50 + \frac{P_A}{2} \]

We are also given that the sum of their ages is 140:
\[ A + B = 140 \]
\[ 50 + B = 140 \]
\[ B = 90 \]

Using \( B = 90 \) in the equation above, we get:
\[ 90 = 50 + \frac{P_A}{2} \]
\[ 90 - 50 = \frac{P_A}{2} \]
\[ 40 = \frac{P_A}{2} \]
\[ P_A = 80 \]

So, Asaf has 80 pencils. Since Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf:
\[ P_B = P_A + 60 \]
\[ P_B = 80 + 60 \]
\[ P_B = 140 \]

The total number of pencils they have together is:

Let's denote Asaf's age as \( A = 50 \) years. Let Alexander's age be \( a \) years. The total number of years between Asaf and Alexander is \( a - A = a - 50 \). According to the problem, this age difference is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. Let's denote the number of pencils Asaf has as \( P_A \). So, we have:
\[ a - 50 = \frac{1}{2} P_A \]
\[ P_A = 2(a - 50) \]

The sum of their ages is given as:
\[ A + a = 140 \]
\[ 50 + a = 140 \]
\[ a = 90 \]

So, Alexander's age \( a \) is 90 years. Substituting \( a = 90 \) into the equation for the number of pencils Asaf has:
\[ P_A = 2(a - 50) = 2(90 - 50) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Now, let's denote the number of pencils Alexander has as \( P_A \). According to the problem, Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf:
\[ P_A = 80 + 60 = 140 \]

So, the total number of pencils they have together is:

Let's denote Asaf's age as \( A = 50 \). Let Alexander's age be \( E \). According to the problem, the age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. Let the number of pencils Asaf has be \( P_A \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ E - A = \frac{P_A}{2} \]
Since \( A = 50 \), we have:
\[ E - 50 = \frac{P_A}{2} \]
\[ E = \frac{P_A}{2} + 50 \]

We also know that the sum of their ages is 140:

\[ 50 + E = 140 \]
\[ E = 90 \]

Now we substitute \( E = 90 \) into the first equation:
\[ 90 - 50 = \frac{P_A}{2} \]
\[ 40 = \frac{P_A}{2} \]
\[ P_A = 80 \]

Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, so the number of pencils Alexander has is:

Let's denote Asaf's age as \( A = 50 \) years. Let the age difference between Asaf and Alexander be \( D \). According to the problem, \( D = \frac{1}{2} \times 140 \), which gives us \( D = 70 \) years. Therefore, Alexander's age is \( 50 + 70 = 120 \) years. Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, so if Asaf has \( P \) pencils, Alexander has \( P + 60 \) pencils. However, we are not given the number of pencils Alexander has directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of their ages is 140.

Let Alexander's age be \( A' \). We have two equations based on the given information:
\[ A + A' = 140 \]
\[ 50 + 120 = 170 \neq 140 \]

This seems incorrect because no \( A' \) exists such that both equations hold simultaneously. Hence, we need to find the number of pencils they have together without directly using Alexander's age. We'll do this step by step.

The sum of their ages is 140, and we know Asaf is 50 years old, so Alexander must be \( 140 - 50 = 90 \) years old. Since there's no direct information about the number of pencils Alexander has, we'll calculate the number of pencils Asaf has. Asaf has \( P \) pencils. If Alexander has \( P + 60 \) pencils, and the sum of Asaf and Alexander's ages is 140, this means:

\[ P + (P + 60) = 140 \]
\[ 2P + 60 = 140 \]
\[ 2P = 80 \]
\[ P = 40 \]

So, Asaf has 40 pencils, and Alexander has \( 40 + 60 = 100 \) pencils. The total number of pencils they have together is \( 40 + 100 = 140 \).

\[A + E = 140.\]
Since \(A = 50\), we can substitute it into the equation:

So, Alexander is 90 years old.

The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is:

According to the problem, this age difference is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. Let's denote the number of pencils Asaf has by \(P_A\). Hence:

We know that Asaf is 50 years old and that the total age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the number of pencils Asaf has. This means that Alexander is 10 years younger than Asaf (since 50 / 2 = 25, but Asaf is 50, which means Alexander is 25 years younger, or 10 years younger since Asaf is the older one). Therefore, Alexander is 40 years old (50 - 10).

Now, the sum of their ages is 140. So, we can write this as:
\[ Asaf's \ age + Alexander's \ age = 140 \]
\[ 50 + 40 = 90 \]

However, this seems incorrect because the sum should be 140. Let's correct the calculation of Alexander's age by setting up the correct equation based on the problem statement:
\[ Asaf's \ age + Alexander's \ age = 140 \]
\[ Asaf's \ age + (Asaf's \ age - 10) = 140 \]
\[ 2 \times Asaf's \ age - 10 = 140 \]
\[ 2 \times Asaf's \ age = 150 \]
\[ Asaf's \ age = 75 \]

So, Alexander is:
\[ 140 - 75 = 65 \]

Now, they have 60 more pencils than Asaf. Since Asaf has 75 pencils:
\[ Asaf's \ pencils = 75 \]
\[ Alexander's \ pencils = 75 + 60 = 135 \]

The total number of pencils they have together is:
\[ 75 + 135 = 210 \]

Let's denote Asaf's age by \( A \) and Alexander's age by \( A_2 \).

From the given information, we know:
1. Asaf's age \( A = 50 \).
2. The sum of their ages is 140: \( A + A_2 = 140 \).
3. Asaf's age difference from Alexander is half the number of pencils Asaf has: \( |A - A_2| = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \) (since Asaf has 60 more pencils than Alexander).

First, we can find Alexander's age by substituting \( A \) into the sum equation:
\[ 50 + A_2 = 140 \]
\[ A_2 = 140 - 50 = 90 \]

Now that we have Alexander's age, we can calculate the difference in their ages:
\[ |50 - 90| = 40 \]

Since Asaf's age difference from Alexander is half of the pencils Asaf has:
\[ 40 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{number of pencils Asaf has} \]
\[ \text{number of pencils Asaf has} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, so:
\[ \text{number of pencils Alexander has} = 80 + 60 = 140 \]

The total number of pencils they have together:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 80 + 140 = 220 \]

Let's verify with the final calculation:
\[ A_A + A_{A_2} = 50 + 90 = 140 \]
\[ 50 - 90 = 40 = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 \]

So, the total number of pencils is 220.
