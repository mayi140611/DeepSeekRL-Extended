###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Rosie runs 6 miles per hour. She runs for 1 hour on Monday, 30 minutes on Tuesday, 1 hour on Wednesday, and 20 minutes on Thursday. If she wants to run 20 miles for the week, how many minutes should she run on Friday?

#### ANS ####

30
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
The total minutes Rosie runs from Monday to Thursday is 60 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 170 minutes. She wants to run for a total of 20 miles in the week, and since she runs 6 miles per hour, she will need to run for 20/6 = 3 and 2/3 hours. Since the total time from Monday to Thursday is 170 minutes, she needs to run for a further 3 and 2/3 hours - 170 minutes = 130 minutes on Friday.

Rosie runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

On Monday, she runs for 1 hour, which is 2 miles (since 6 miles per hour * 1 hour = 6 miles).
On Tuesday, she runs for 30 minutes, which is 1 mile (since 0.5 hours * 6 miles per hour = 3 miles for 30 minutes).
On Wednesday, she runs for 1 hour, which is 6 miles.
From Monday to Thursday, she runs a total of 2 + 1 + 6 = 9 miles.

To run 20 miles in the week, she needs to run 20 - 9 = 11 miles on Friday.

Since she runs at 6 miles per hour, she needs to run for 11 / 6 = 1.83 hours on Friday.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she needs to run for 1.83 * 60 = 110 minutes on Friday.

Rosie runs a total of 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 20/60 = 2.6666667 miles between Monday and Thursday. To reach 20 miles, she should run 20 - 2.6666667 = 17.3333333 miles on Friday.

17.3333333 miles at 6 miles per hour requires 17.3333333/6 = 2.8888889 hour.

Therefore, Rosie needs to run 2.8888889 x 60 = 173.3333333 minutes on Friday.

system
Rosie runs a total of:
1 hour * 6 miles/hour = 6 miles on Monday;
30 minutes * (6 miles/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 3 miles on Tuesday;
1 hour * 6 miles/hour = 6 miles on Wednesday;
20 minutes * (6 miles/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2 miles on Thursday.

20 miles - 6 miles (Mon) - 3 miles (Tue) - 6 miles (Wed) - 2 miles (Thu) = 1 mile left to run this week.

6 miles/hour = $\frac{6}{60}$hour = 0.1 hours;

0.1 * 60 minutes/hour = 6 minutes.

Therefore, Rosie needs to run for 6 minutes on Friday.

Rosie runs at a rate of 6 miles per hour. On Monday, she runs for 1 hour, covering a distance of 6 miles/hour * 1 hour = 6 miles. On Tuesday, she runs for 30 minutes, which is 30 minutes/60 minutes = 0.5 hours, covering a distance of 6 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 3 miles.

On Wednesday, she runs for 1 hour. This means she has already covered 6 miles + 3 miles = 9 miles by Wednesday. Rosie aims to run a total of 20 miles for the week. She has already covered 9 miles, meaning she needs to run an additional 20 miles - 9 miles = 11 miles on Friday.

To find out how many minutes Rosie needs to run on Friday, we set up a ratio of her running rate to the total distance she needs to cover. Her rate is 6 miles per hour, and she needs to run 11 miles on Friday.

First, convert the total miles to hours to use the rate: 11 miles is the same as 11/6 hours.

Then, set up the ratio: (11/6 hours) / 6 miles per hour = (11/6) / 6 which equals (11/36) hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 minutes/hour = (11/36) * 60 = 110/3 = 36.67 minutes.

Rosie runs 6 miles per hour, so in 1 hour she runs 6 miles.

On Monday: 1 hour * 6 miles/hour = 6 miles
On Tuesday: 0.5 hour * 6 miles/hour = 3 miles
On Wednesday: 1 hour * 6 miles/hour = 6 miles
On Thursday: 0.333 hour * 6 miles/hour = 2 miles

In total, she has run so far: 6 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 17 miles.

She wants to run 20 miles for the week, so she needs to run 20 - 17 = 3 miles on Friday.

Since she runs at 6 miles per hour, it will take her 3 miles / 6 miles/hour = 0.5 hour to run the remaining 3 miles.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 0.5 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.

Therefore, Rosie should run for 30 minutes on Friday.

Rosie runs 6 miles per hour for different durations on different days. 

On Monday, she runs for 1 hour, so she runs 6 miles/1 hour = 6 miles.
On Tuesday, she runs 30 minutes, which is 30/60 = 0.5 hours, and she runs 6 miles/0.5 hour = 12 miles.
On Wednesday, she runs for 1 hour, so she runs 6 miles/hour = 6 miles.
On Thursday, she runs 20 minutes, which is 20/60 = 1/3 hour, and she runs 6 miles/1/3 hour = 18 miles.

In total, she runs 6 + 12 + 6 + 18 = 32 miles if she runs for the same duration every day.

To run 20 miles for the week, she needs to run a total of 20 miles - 32 miles = -12 miles, which means she needs to run backwards for 12 miles.

If she runs backwards, she would need to run 12/6 = 2 hours to run -12 miles backward.

Since she already runs for 1 hour on Monday, 30 minutes on Tuesday, and 1 hour on Wednesday, she cannot run backwards for 2 hours on Friday.

Therefore, she needs to double her speed to run backwards faster. Since she runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour, she needs to run backwards at a speed of 6 miles/2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

To run 12 miles at a speed of 3 miles per hour, she needs to run for 12 miles/3 miles/hour = 4 hours.

Since she already runs for 1 hour on Monday, 30 minutes on Tuesday, and 1 hour on Wednesday, she needs to run for 4 hours - 1 hour - 30 minutes = 1 hour on Friday.

To convert hours to minutes, she needs to run 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes on Friday.

Rosie runs 6 miles per hour. On Monday, she runs for 1 hour, so she runs \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}\). On Tuesday, she runs for 30 minutes, which is \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ miles}\). On Wednesday, she runs for 1 hour, so she runs \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance she has run up to Thursday is \(6 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 17 \text{ miles}\). To reach 20 miles for the week, she needs to run \(20 - 17 = 3 \text{ miles}\) on Friday. Since she runs 6 miles per hour, the time she needs to run on Friday is \(3 \text{ miles} \div 6 \text{ miles/hour} = 0.5 \text{ hour}\). Converting 0.5 hour to minutes, she needs to run \(0.5 \text{ hour} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}\) on Friday.

First, calculate the total distance Rosie has already run from Monday to Thursday:
- Distance on Monday: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 6 \text{ miles/hour} = 6 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance on Tuesday: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ miles/hour} = 3 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance on Wednesday: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 6 \text{ miles/hour} = 6 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance on Thursday: \(0.333 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ miles/hour} = 2 \text{ miles}\)

Total distance run from Monday to Thursday: \(6 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 17 \text{ miles}\)

Rosie wants to run a total of 20 miles for the week. Therefore, the distance she needs to run on Friday is:
\(20 \text{ miles} - 17 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles}\)

Now, figure out how many minutes it will take her to run 3 miles at 6 miles per hour:
- Time on Friday: \(3 \text{ miles} \div 6 \text{ miles/hour} = 0.5 \text{ hours}\)
- Convert this to minutes: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}\)

Rosie runs at a rate of 6 miles per hour. On Monday, she runs for 1 hour, on Tuesday for 30 minutes, on Wednesday for 1 hour, and on Thursday for 20 minutes.

Her distances run in time units are: Monday(6 miles), Tuesday(1 mile), Wednesday(6 miles), and Thursday(1 mile).

So the total distance she runs on the four days is 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 14 miles.

She wants to run 20 miles for the week, so she must run an extra 20 - 14 = 6 miles on Friday.

Her speed is 6 miles per hour, so it takes her 6 miles / 6 mph = 1 hour.

Since she runs 1 hour on Friday, she will run 1 hour x 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes on Friday.
