Since Ariella has $200 more in her son's savings account than Daniella does, we need to find out her total savings. Daniella has $400 and Ariella has $400 + $200 = $600 in her son's savings account. 

Ariella's account earns simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The amount of interest she will earn in the first year is calculated as follows: $600 \times 10\% = $60. 

In the second year, her interest also earns 10% of her total amount, which means it multiplies her amount by 1.10 for each year. After two years, the total amount of money in her account is: $600 + ($600 + $60) \times 1.10 = $600 + ($660) \times 1.1 = $600 + $726 = $1326.

Let's start by determining how much money Ariella has in her son's savings account. Since Ariella has $200 more than Daniella, and Daniella has $400, we can calculate Ariella's balance as follows:

\[
\text{Ariella's amount} = \text{Daniella's amount} + \$200 = \$400 + \$200 = \$600
\]

Next, we need to calculate the interest Ariella's account earns over two years. Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Substituting the given values:

\[
P = \$600, \quad r = 0.10, \quad t = 2
\]

The simple interest Ariella earns over two years is:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \$600 \times 0.10 \times 2 = \$600 \times 0.2 = \$120
\]

To find the total amount of money in Ariella's account after two years, we add the simple interest to the principal amount:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = \$600 + \$120 = \$720
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Ariella will have after two years is:

\[
\boxed{720}
\]

Let's calculate this step by step:

1) First, we need to determine how much money Ariella has: $200 more than Daniella means $400 + $200 = $600.

2) Ariella's account earns 10% simple interest per annum, which means the interest rate is 10/100 = 0.1 as a decimal.

3) The interest per year is $600 * 0.1 = $60.

4) After two years, the total interest will be $60 * 2 = $120. 

5) To find the total amount after two years, we add the interest to the initial amount: $600 + $120 = $720.

Let's denote the amount of money Ariella has as \(A\) and the amount Daniella has as \(D\). According to the problem, Ariella has $200 more than Daniella, so we can express this as:
\[ A = D + 200 \]
Given that Daniella has $400, we can substitute \(D\) with 400:
\[ A = 400 + 200 = 600 \]
Now, we need to calculate the interest Ariella's account will earn over two years. The interest rate is 10% per annum, so the interest per year for Ariella is:
\[ \text{Annual interest} = A \times \frac{10}{100} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
Since the interest is simple interest, the total interest earned over two years is:
\[ \text{Total interest over 2 years} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]
Therefore, the total amount of money Ariella will have after two years is:
\[ \text{Total amount} = A + 120 = 600 + 120 = 720 \]
So, Ariella will have \(\boxed{720}\) dollars after two years.

Let's denote the amount of money Daniella has as \( D \) and the amount of money Ariella has as \( A \). According to the problem, \( D = $400 \).

The problem states that Ariella has $200 more in her account than Daniella. Hence, we can express the amount Ariella has as:
\[ A = D + 200 \]
\[ A = 400 + 200 \]
\[ A = 600 \]

Now we know that Ariella's account earns simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum. Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment or loan amount), \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal), and \( t \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

So, for Ariella:
\[ P = 600 \] (the amount in her account)
\[ r = 0.10 \] (the interest rate in decimal)
\[ t = 2 \] (since we need the interest after 2 years)

The simple interest earned by Ariella after 2 years will be:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 600 \times 0.10 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 600 \times 0.20 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = $120 \]

To find the total amount Ariella will have after 2 years, we add the simple interest to the principal amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 600 + 120 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = $720 \]

Therefore, after two years, Ariella will have $720 in her son's saving account.

Given:
- Ariella has $200 more in her son's savings account than Daniella.
- Daniella has $400 in her son's savings account.
- Ariella's account earns simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum.

First, calculate the amount of money Ariella has initially:
\[

Let's calculate the initial amount in Ariella's account. Since Ariella has $200 more than Daniella and Daniella has $400, Ariella initially has $400 + $200 = $600 in her account.

Next, we will calculate the interest rate and the time period. Ariella's account earns 10% interest annually, and Daniella's account earns 10% interest annually for the same period of two years.

Interest formula for simple interest is:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

where \( I \) is the interest earned, \( P \) is the principal (initial amount), \( r \) is the rate of interest, and \( t \) is the time.

For Ariella's account, \( P = 600 \), \( r = 0.10 \) (10% in decimal form), and \( t \) is 2 years. The total amount after 2 years can be calculated as:

\[ A = P + I \]

Substitute the values:

\[ I_{Ariella} = 600 \times 0.10 \times 2 \]

\[ I_{Ariella} = 60 \]

Now, add the total interest to the principal:

\[ A_{Ariella} = 600 + 60 \]

\[ A_{Ariella} = 660 \]

So, after two years, Ariella will have $660 in her account.

Let's calculate the amount in Ariella's account after interest.

Initially, Ariella has $400 (since Ariella has $200 more than Daniella).

The formula for simple interest is: 

    Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

The principal (P) is the amount she initially has, which is $400. The rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 2 years.

Interest = $400 × 0.10 × 2

Interest = $400 × 0.20
Interest = $80

Total after 2 years = Initial amount + Interest

Total = $400 + $80

Total = $480

So Ariella will have $480 in her son's savings account after two years.

Now, substituting the value of \( D \) into the equation for \( A \):

So, Ariella has $600 initially.

Ariella's account earns simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum. 
- Simple Interest formula is: \( \text{Interest (SI)} = P \times R \times T \),

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. First, we know that Ariella has $200 more in her son's saving account than Daniella. Since Daniella has $400, we can calculate the amount Ariella has:
   Ariella's account amount = Daniella's account amount + $200
   Ariella's account amount = $400 + $200 = $600

2. Ariella's account earns simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The formula for calculating simple interest is:
   Simple Interest (SI) = Principal × Rate × Time
   where Principal is the initial amount, Rate is the interest rate per annum, and Time is the time in years.

3. To find the amount of money Ariella will have after two years, we need to calculate the interest earned over that period and add it to the principal amount.
   Simple Interest = $600 × 10% × 2
   Simple Interest = $600 × 0.1 × 2
   Simplifying this, we get:
   Simple Interest = $120 × 2 = $240

4. Now, we add the interest earned to the principal amount to find the total amount after two years:
   Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest
   Total Amount = $600 + $240 = $840

5. Therefore, after two years, Ariella will have $840 in her son's saving account.
