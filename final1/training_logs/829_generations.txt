Let's denote the distance Hannah walked as \( h \) kilometers. According to the problem, Nadia walked 18 kilometers, which is twice as far as Hannah walked. This relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 18 = 2h \]

To find the distance Hannah walked, we solve for \( h \):
\[ h = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]
So, Hannah walked 9 kilometers.

The total distance walked by both Nadia and Hannah is the sum of the distances each walked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 18 + 9 = 27 \]

Therefore, the total distance the two girls walked is 27 kilometers.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the distance Hannah walked as \( H \) kilometers. According to the problem, Nadia walked 18 kilometers, and this distance was twice as far as Hannah walked. Thus, we have the equation:
\[
2H = 18
\]
To find \( H \), we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
H = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total distance walked by both Nadia and Hannah. The total distance is the sum of Nadia's distance and Hannah's distance:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Nadia's distance} + \text{Hannah's distance} = 18 + 9 = 27 \text{ kilometers}
\]

So, the two girls walked a total of 27 kilometers.

Let's denote the distance Hannah walked as \( h \) kilometers. According to the problem, Nadia walked twice as far as Hannah, so we have \( 18 = 2h \). Solving for \( h \), we get \( h = 9 \) kilometers. Therefore, Hannah walked 9 kilometers.

To find the total distance walked by both Nadia and Hannah, we add Nadia's distance to Hannah's distance:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 18 + 9 = 27 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now, let's verify:
Nadia's distance is twice Hannah's distance: \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \) kilometers, confirming the given information.

So, the total distance walked by Nadia and Hannah is \( 27 \) kilometers.

Let's denote the distance Hannah walked as \( x \) kilometers. According to the problem, Nadia walked twice as far as Hannah, so Nadia walked \( 2x \) kilometers. We know Nadia walked 18 kilometers, so we can set up the equation \( 2x = 18 \).

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ x = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Hannah walked 9 kilometers. To find the total distance the two girls walked, we add Nadia's distance and Hannah's distance together:
\[ 18 + 9 = 27 \]

Therefore, the two girls walked a total of 27 kilometers.

#### GENERATION 12 RESPONSE ####

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how far Hannah walked. Since Nadia walked 18 kilometers, which was twice as far as Hannah walked, we can set up the equation:
\[
N = 2H
\]
where \(N\) is Nadia's distance and \(H\) is Hannah's distance.

Substitute the distance Nadia walked into the equation:
\[
18 = 2H
\]
To solve for \(H\), divide both sides by 2:
\[
H = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]
So, Hannah walked 9 kilometers.

Now, to find the total distance walked by both Nadia and Hannah, we add their distances together:
\[
\text{Total distance} = N + H = 18 + 9 = 27
\]

Therefore, the total distance the two girls walked is 27 kilometers.
