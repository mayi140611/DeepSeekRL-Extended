To find out how much money the pie shop will earn, we first need to calculate the total number of slices they can make from 6 whole custard pies.

Each whole pie is cut into 10 slices, so 6 whole pies will contain:
\[6 \times 10 = 60 \, \text{slices}\]

The pie shop charges $3 per slice, so the total earnings from 60 slices will be:
\[60 \times 3 = 180 \, \text{dollars}\]

system
To determine how much money the pie shop will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of slices from one whole pie.
2. Determine the total number of slices from 6 whole pies.
3. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total number of slices by the price per slice.

Step 1: Each whole pie is cut into 10 slices.
\[ \text{Number of slices per whole pie} = 10 \]

Step 2: The pie shop makes 6 whole pies.
\[ \text{Total number of slices} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \]

Step 3: The pie shop charges $3 per slice.
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

Therefore, the pie shop will earn $180.

To determine how much money the pie shop will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices from 6 whole pies.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.**

Each whole pie is cut into 10 slices. Therefore, 6 whole pies will have:
\[ 6 \text{ pies} \times 10 \text{ slices per pie} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue.**

The pie shop charges $3 per slice. Therefore, for 60 slices, the total revenue will be:
\[ 60 \text{ slices} \times 3 \text{ dollars per slice} = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the pie shop will earn \(\boxed{180}\) dollars.

To calculate the total earnings, we first find out the earnings from one whole pie and then multiply it by the number of pies made. 

The earnings from one whole pie are:
\[ 10 \text{ slices/pie} \times \$3/\text{slice} = \$30 \text{/pie} \]

Since they make 6 whole pies:
\[ \$30/\text{pie} \times 6 \text{ pies} = \$180 \]

Therefore, the total earnings from 6 pies is:

To determine how much money the pie shop will earn, we need to calculate the total number of pie slices and then multiply by the price per slice.

First, we calculate the total number of slices from all the pies:
\[ 6 \text{ pies} \times 10 \text{ slices per pie} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of slices by the price per slice:
\[ 60 \text{ slices} \times \$3 \text{ per slice} = \$180 \]

Therefore, the pie shop will earn \(\$180\).

2. Multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to find the total earnings.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices**

Each whole pie is cut into 10 slices, and there are 6 whole pies. So, the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ slices/pie} \times 6 \text{ pies} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings**

The shop charges $3 per slice. So, the total earnings from 60 slices is:

To determine how much money the pie shop will earn, we need to calculate the revenue from selling all the slices of pie.

First, we find out the total number of slices from all 6 whole pies. Since each pie is cut into 10 slices, we multiply the number of pies by the number of slices per pie:

\[
6 \text{ pies} \times 10 \text{ slices per pie} = 60 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total number of slices by the charge per slice:

\[
60 \text{ slices} \times 3 \text{ dollars per slice} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the pie shop will earn \(\boxed{180}\) dollars.

The pie shop charges $3 per slice of custard pie, and there are 10 slices in each whole pie. Therefore, the price per slice is $3 / 10 = $0.30.

If the pie shop makes 6 whole custard pies, then the total number of slices is 6 * 10 = 60 slices.

The total earnings from the 60 slices at $0.30 per slice is 60 * $0.30 = $18.
