###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Bucky earns money each weekend catching and selling fish. He wants to save up for a new video game, which costs $60. Last weekend he earned $35. He can earn $5 from trout and $4 from blue-gill. He caught five fish this Sunday. If 60% were trout, and the rest were blue-gill, how much more does he need to save before he can buy the game?

To determine how much more Bucky needs to save before he can buy the video game, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of trout and blue-gill Bucky caught this Sunday.
2. Calculate the earnings from the trout and blue-gill.
3. Add the earnings from last weekend to the earnings from this Sunday to find the total savings.
4. Subtract the total savings from the cost of the video game to find out how much more he needs to save.

Step 1: Calculate the number of trout and blue-gill Bucky caught this Sunday.
- Total fish caught = 5
- Percentage of trout = 60%
- Number of trout = 60% of 5 = 0.60 * 5 = 3
- Number of blue-gill = Total fish caught - Number of trout = 5 - 3 = 2

Step 2: Calculate the earnings from the trout and blue-gill.
- Earnings from trout = Number of trout * Earnings per trout = 3 * $5 = $15
- Earnings from blue-gill = Number of blue-gill * Earnings per blue-gill = 2 * $4 = $8

Step 3: Add the earnings from last weekend to the earnings from this Sunday to find the total savings.
- Total savings = Earnings from last weekend + Earnings from this Sunday = $35 + ($15 + $8) = $35 + $23 = $58

Step 4: Subtract the total savings from the cost of the video game to find out how much more he needs to save.
- Cost of the video game = $60
- Amount saved = $58
- Amount needed = Cost of the video game - Amount saved = $60 - $58 = $2

Therefore, Bucky needs to save an additional $2 before he can buy the video game.

To determine how much more Bucky needs to save before he can buy the video game, we first need to calculate the total amount he has already saved and the total amount he will save this Sunday from his fish.

1. **Initial Savings**:
   Bucky has already saved $35 from last weekend.

2. **Amount from Last Sunday**:
   Bucky can earn $5 from trout and $4 from blue-gill. The fish he caught this Sunday are a mix of trout and blue-gill. We know that 60% of the fish he caught were trout. Therefore, 40% were blue-gill.

3. **Amount from This Sunday**:
   - Trout: \(0.6 \times 5 = 3\) dollars
   - Blue-gill: \(0.4 \times 5 = 2\) dollars

4. **Total Amount This Sunday**:
   \(3 + 2 = 5\) dollars

5. **Total Savings**:
   - Initial savings: $35
   - Total this Sunday: $5
   - Total savings: \(35 + 5 = 40\) dollars

6. **Cost of the Video Game**:
   The video game costs $60.

7. **Amount Needed to Save**:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Bucky needs to save $20 more before he can buy the video game.

Let's calculate how many trout and blue-gill Bucky caught this Sunday:

- Bucky caught a total of 5 fish.
- 60% of the fish were trout, so 0.6 * 5 = 3 trout were caught.
- The rest of the fish were blue-gill, so 5 - 3 = 2 blue-gill were caught.

Now we know Bucky can earn $5 from each trout and $4 from each blue-gill.

- Earnings from trout: 3 trout * $5/trout = $15
- Earnings from blue-gill: 2 blue-gill * $4/blue-gill = $8

Total earnings this Sunday: $15 (from trout) + $8 (from blue-gill) = $23

Bucky earned $23 this Sunday, plus his previous earnings of $35, so he has:

- $35 (previous earnings) + $23 (Sunday earnings) = $58

He needs $60 to buy the video game, so he needs $60 - $58 = $2 more to buy the game.

First, we need to determine the number of trout and blue-gill Bucky caught this Sunday. We know that 60% of the five fish were trout, so we calculate the number of trout as follows:

\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ trout} \]

The rest of the fish were blue-gill, so we calculate the number of blue-gill as follows:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ blue-gill} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Bucky earned from trout. Since he earns $5 for each trout, he earned:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars from trout} \]

Then, we calculate how much money Bucky earned from blue-gill. Since he earns $4 for each blue-gill, he earned:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars from blue-gill} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money Bucky earned this Sunday:

\[ 15 + 8 = 23 \text{ dollars} \]

We know that last weekend Bucky earned $35. Adding this to the amount he earned this Sunday gives:

\[ 35 + 23 = 58 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Bucky has a total of $58 saved. He needs $60 to buy the video game. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the game:

\[ 60 - 58 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Bucky needs to save 2 more dollars before he can buy the game.

First, let's calculate how many fish Bucky caught and how many of them were trout. Bucky caught five fish in total, and 60% of them were trout.

The number of trout is:
\(5 \times 0.60 = 3\) trout

The rest were blue-gill, so:
\(5 - 3 = 2\) blue-gill

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the trout.
\(3 \text{ trout} \times \$5/\text{trout} = \$15\)

And the earnings from the blue-gill.
\(2 \text{ blue-gill} \times \$4/\text{blue-gill} = \$8\)

Now we'll add up the earnings from both types of fish:
\[ \$15 (\text{from trout}) + \$8 (\text{from blue-gill}) = \$23\]

Bucky earned $23 from catching fish this Sunday. Adding that to the $35 he earned from last weekend:
\[ \$23 (\text{Sunday earnings}) + \$35 (\text{from last weekend}) = \$58\]

Bucky wants to buy a $60 video game, so we need to calculate how much more he needs to save:
\[ \$60 (\text{cost of the game}) - \$58 (\text{saved so far}) = \$2\]

Therefore, Bucky still needs to save $2 more before he can buy the game.

To determine how much more Bucky needs to save, we first calculate his earnings from the fish he caught this Sunday.

Bucky caught a total of five fish. If 60% were trout, then:

This leaves 5 - 3 = 2 blue-gill.

From trout, Bucky earned:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}\]
From blue-gill, Bucky earned:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}\]

Adding these amounts together gives Bucky's total earnings for Sunday:

To determine how much more Bucky needs to save, we first need to calculate how much money he has earned in total from both weekends.

Last weekend, Bucky earned $35.
This Sunday, he caught five fish, with 60% being trout, so:
- He caught \( 5 \times 0.6 = 3 \) trout.
- He caught \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) blue-gill.

From the trout, he earns \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.
From the blue-gill, he earns \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

So, this Sunday he earned \( 15 + 8 = 23 \) dollars.

In total, Bucky has earned \( 35 + 23 = 58 \) dollars over the two weekends.

To determine how much more Bucky needs to save before he can buy the video game, we need to calculate his total earnings for this weekend and compare it to the cost of the game.

First, we know that Bucky caught five fish this Sunday. According to the problem, 60% of the fish were trout and the rest were blue-gill.

Calculation of the number of trout:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ trout} \]

Calculation of the number of blue-gill:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ blue-gill} \]

Next, we calculate Bucky's earnings from each type of fish:
- Earnings from trout:

- Earnings from blue-gill:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both types of fish:
\[ 15 + 8 = 23 \text{ dollars} \]

Bucky earned $23 this weekend. Adding this to his previous earnings:
\[ 35 + 23 = 58 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the video game is $60. Therefore, the amount of money Bucky still needs to save is:
\[ 60 - 58 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

First, we need to find out how many trout and blue-gill Bucky caught this Sunday. Since 60% were trout, that means 60% of 5 fish are trout, and the rest are blue-gill. 

- Percentage of trout = 60%
- Number of trout = 60% of 5 = 0.60 * 5 = 3 trout
- Number of blue-gill = 5 - 3 = 2 blue-gill

Next, we calculate the money Bucky earns from the trout and blue-gill:

- Money from trout = 3 trout * $5/trout = $15
- Money from blue-gill = 2 blue-gill * $4/blue-gill = $8

So, the total money Bucky earned this Sunday = $15 + $8 = $23

Adding this to what he earned last weekend gives the total savings:

- Total savings = Last weekend's earnings + Sunday's earnings = $35 + $23 = $58

To find out how much more Bucky needs to save to buy the $60 video game:

First, we need to determine how many trout and blue-gill fish Bucky caught this Sunday. Given that 60% of the 5 fish were trout, Bucky caught \(5 \times 0.60 = 3\) trout. The rest were blue-gill, so Bucky caught \(5 - 3 = 2\) blue-gill fish.

Next, we calculate how much money Bucky earned from the trout and blue-gill. He earns $5 for each trout and $4 for each blue-gill fish. Thus, from the 3 trout, he earned \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars, and from the 2 blue-gill fish, he earned \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars. In total, Bucky earned \(15 + 8 = 23\) dollars this Sunday.

Finally, to find out how much more Bucky needs to save before he can buy the video game, we subtract the money he already has from the total cost of the game. He has $35 from last weekend and $23 this Sunday, so he has \(35 + 23 = 58\) dollars in total. The video game costs $60, so he needs \(60 - 58 = 2\) more dollars.
