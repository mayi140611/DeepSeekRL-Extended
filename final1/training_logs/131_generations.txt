###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Studying for her test, Mitchell had read ten chapters of a book before 4 o'clock. When it clocked 4, Mitchell had read 20 pages of the 11th chapter of the book she was studying from. After 4 o'clock, she didn't read the remaining pages of chapter eleven but proceeded and read 2 more chapters of the book. If each chapter in the book had 40 pages, calculate the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether?

system
Before 4 o'clock, Mitchell had read 10 chapters of the book. Each chapter has 40 pages, so the total pages she read before 4 o'clock is 10 * 40 = 400 pages.

When it clocked 4, Mitchell had read the first 20 pages of the 11th chapter. Now she read 2 more chapters after 4 o'clock. Each chapter has 40 pages, so these 2 chapters contain 2 * 40 = 80 pages.

Mitchell didn't read the remaining pages of the 11th chapter but did read the remaining pages of the other chapters.

At 4 o'clock, there were 100 pages left in the 11th chapter, and she didn't read them, so there were 0 pages left for Mitchell to read from the 11th chapter after 4 o'clock.

The total number of pages Mitchell read = 400 + 80 = 480 pages.

The total number of pages in the first 11 chapters is (11 * 40) = 440 pages. Mitchell read the remaining pages of the 11th chapter, which is 40 - 20 = 20 pages. She then read 2 more chapters of the book, which means she read an additional 2 * 40 = 80 pages. Adding all the pages together will give the total number of pages read, which is 440 + 20 + 80 = 540 pages.

There are 11 chapters in the book each having 40 pages.
After 4 o'clock, Mitchell had 20 pages of the 11th chapter of the book.
Therefore, before 4 o'clock, Mitchell had 10 * 40 = 400 pages.
Thereafter, Mitchell read 20 + 20 = 40 pages.
Hence, the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether is 400 + 40 = 440.

Mitchell read ten full chapters, which equate to \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \) pages. In total she had read 20 pages of the eleventh chapter, bringing the total to \( 400 + 20 = 420 \) pages. She then proceeded to read two more chapters. Each chapter has 40 pages, so in two chapters she read \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) pages. Altogether, she had read \( 420 + 80 = 500 \) pages.

Each chapter in the book had 40 pages, and Mitchell had read ten chapters before 4 o'clock, which means she had read 10 * 40 = 400 pages. She also read the entire 11th chapter after 4 o'clock, which means she read an additional 40 * 2 = 80 pages. She didn't read the remaining pages of chapter eleven, so we don't count them towards her total. She also proceeded to read two more chapters of the book, which means she read (2 * 40) = 80 additional pages. 

Mitchell had read 400 pages before 4 o'clock, 80 pages from the 11th chapter, and 80 pages from the additional two chapters. Therefore, the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether is 400 + 80 + 80 = 560 pages.

Mitchell read ten chapters of ten chapters before 4 o'clock, so that's 100 pages. 20 pages in the 11th chapter. 40 pages in each chapter, so she read 40*2 = 80 more pages from the 2 chapters after 4. So she read 100+80 = 180 pages before proceeding to read another chapter. After reading two more chapters, she read an additional 40*2 = 80 pages. So in total, she read 180+80 = 260 pages altogether.

To calculate the total number of pages Mitchell read, we need to consider the pages she had read before 4 o'clock and the pages she read after 4 o'clock.

Before 4 o'clock:
- Read 10 chapters * 40 pages/chapter = 400 pages
- Additionally, read 20 pages of the 11th chapter = 20 pages

After 4 o'clock:
- Read 2 more chapters * 40 pages/chapter = 80 pages

Total pages read:
- Pages before 4 o'clock: 400 + 20 = 420 pages
- Pages after 4 o'clock: 80 pages
- Total: 420 pages + 80 pages = 500 pages

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Pages read before 4 o'clock:**
   - Mitchell read 10 complete chapters.
   - Each chapter has 40 pages.
   - Total pages read before 4 o'clock = \(10 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages/chapter}\) = 400 pages.

2. **Pages read from the 11th chapter after 4 o'clock:**
   - Mitchell read 20 pages of the 11th chapter.
   - Total pages read after 4 o'clock = 20 pages.

3. **Chapters read after 4 o'clock:**
   - Mitchell read 2 more chapters.
   - Since she has already read 10 full chapters, the next two chapters will be the 12th and 13th chapters.
   - Total pages read from the 12th to the 13th chapters = \(2 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages/chapter}\) = 80 pages.

Now, let's sum up all the pages read:

- Total pages read before 4 o'clock: 400 pages
- Pages read from the 11th chapter: 20 pages
- Pages read from the 12th to the 13th chapters: 80 pages

Total pages read altogether = \(400 + 20 + 80 = 500\) pages.

To calculate the total number of pages Mitchell read, we need to consider the chapters she has already read and the chapters she read after 4 o'clock.

1. She read 10 chapters before 4 o'clock. Since each chapter has 40 pages, we calculate the total for the first 10 chapters:
\[ 10 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages/chapter} = 400 \text{ pages} \]

2. By 4 o'clock, she had completed part of the 11th chapter. She read 20 pages of the 11th chapter:
\[ 20 \text{ pages} \]

3. After 4 o'clock, she read 2 more chapters. The number of pages in these two chapters is:
\[ 2 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages/chapter} = 80 \text{ pages} \]

To find the total number of pages she has read altogether, we sum up all the pages:
\[ 400 \text{ pages (first 10 chapters)} + 20 \text{ pages (first part of the 11th chapter)} + 80 \text{ pages (next 2 chapters)} = 400 + 20 + 80 = 500 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether is 500 pages.

The 11th chapter had 40 pages and Mitchell read 20 out of those pages, therefore 40 - 20 = 20 pages remained unread.
Mitchell read 10 chapters before 4 o'clock and each chapter had 40 pages, 10 x 40 = 400 pages had Mitchell read.
The remaining pages read by Mitchell is 20 + 2 = 22 pages.
Mitchell read 10 + 2 = 12 chapters of the book in total.
The 12th and 13th chapters of the book had 40 x 2 = 80 pages together.

Therefore, the answer is 400 + 22 + 80 = 502.

Initially, Mitchell had read 10 chapters of the book, each having 40 pages. So, she had read:

\[10 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages/chapter} = 400 \text{ pages}\]

After 4 o'clock, she read 20 pages of the 11th chapter. So, the total number of pages read by this point is:

\[400 \text{ pages} + 20 \text{ pages} = 420 \text{ pages}\]

Then she proceeded to read 2 more chapters, each of 40 pages. So, the number of pages she read in these 2 chapters is:

\[2 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages/chapter} = 80 \text{ pages}\]

Adding these to the pages already read:

\[420 \text{ pages} + 80 \text{ pages} = 500 \text{ pages}\]

Therefore, the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether is:

\[500\]
