Let's calculate the number of buyers each day in sequence.

The day before yesterday, there were 50 buyers.

Yesterday, there were half the number of buyers as the day before, so:
Yesterday = 50 buyers / 2 = 25 buyers

Today, there are 40 more buyers than yesterday, so:
Today, there are 25 buyers + 40 buyers = 65 buyers

The total number of buyers over the three days is the sum of buyers from each day:
Total = 65 buyers + 25 buyers + 50 buyers = 140 buyers

On the day before, there were 50 buyers.
Yesterday, there were half that number, so 50 / 2 = 25 buyers.
Today, there were 40 more buyers than yesterday, thus 25 + 40 = 65 buyers.
The total number of buyers in the three days is 50 + 25 + 65 = 140 buyers.

To find the total number of buyers over the three days, let's denote the number of buyers on the day before yesterday as \( x \). According to the information given:

- The number of buyers the day before yesterday \( x \) was 50.
- There were half the number of buyers the day before yesterday, so today had \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) buyers.
- There are 40 more buyers today than yesterday, so yesterday had \( 25 - 40 = -15 \) buyers, but since we can't have a negative number of buyers, there must be a mistake. Let's correct this.

Given that there are 40 more buyers today than yesterday, and today had 25 buyers, yesterday had \( 25 - 40 = -15 \). This is incorrect because the number of buyers cannot be negative. Let's reconsider the relationship between the number of buyers on the previous day and today:

- Since yesterday was half the number of buyers as the day before yesterday, and the day before had 50 buyers, yesterday had \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) buyers.
- Today has 40 more buyers than yesterday, so today had \( 25 + 40 = 65 \) buyers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buyers over the three days:

- The day before yesterday, there were 50 buyers.
- Yesterday, there were 25 buyers.
- Today, there were 65 buyers.

The total number of buyers is \( 50 + 25 + 65 = 140 \).

Let's break down the information step-by-step:

1. The day before yesterday, the store had 50 buyers.
2. The day before yesterday had half the number of buyers as the previous day.
   - So, yesterday's buyers = 50 buyers / 2 = 25 buyers.
3. Today has 40 more buyers than yesterday.
   - Today's buyers = 25 buyers + 40 buyers = 65 buyers.

Now, let's add up the total number of buyers over the three days:

Total buyers = The day before yesterday + Yesterday + Today
Total buyers = 50 buyers + 25 buyers + 65 buyers
Total buyers = 140 buyers

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **People who visited yesterday:** Given this portion of the problem, we know from our previous calculation that there were 50 people who were visited the previous day. This is part of the whole 30-day month of 2019.

2. **People who visited the day before yesterday:** As per the information (referencing an earlier piece of calculation), there were half the number of visitors as there were yesterday: 
\[ \text{Number of visitors yesterday} \times \frac{1}{2} = 50 \]
\[ \Rightarrow 50 \times 2 = 100 \]
So, 100 people were there the day before yesterday.

3. **People who visited today** (as given in the question): According to the information, the number of visitors today is 40 more than yesterday's visitors.
\[ \text{Number of visitors today} = \text{Number of visitors yesterday} + 40 \]
\[ \Rightarrow 50 + 40 = 90 \]
So, 90 people were there today.

4. **Total number of visitors over the three days**:
\[ \text{Total visitors} = \text{People who visited yesterday} + \text{People who visited the day before yesterday} + \text{People who visited today} \]
\[ \Rightarrow 50 + 100 + 90 = 240 \]

So, the total number of buyers who've visited the store in the three days is 240.

Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. We know there were 50 buyers the day before yesterday.
2. Yesterday, there were half the number of buyers that the day before there were, which means 50 buyers / 2 = 25 buyers yesterday.
3. Today, there are 40 more buyers than yesterday, which means 25 buyers + 40 buyers = 65 buyers today.

To find the total number of buyers in the three days, we add all the buyers together:

Total buyers = Buyers the day before yesterday + Buyers yesterday + Buyers today
Total buyers = 50 + 25 + 65
Total buyers = 140

Therefore, the total number of buyers who've visited the store in the three days is 140.

To find the total number of buyers who visited the store over the three days, we need to break down the information given:

1. The day before yesterday, there were 50 buyers.
2. The day before yesterday had half the number of buyers as yesterday, which means yesterday had \(2 \times 50 = 100\) buyers.
3. Today has 40 more buyers than yesterday, which means today has \(100 + 40 = 140\) buyers.

Now, let's add up the total number of buyers over the three days:

To find the total number of buyers over the three days, we will solve this step by step:

1. **Number of buyers the day before yesterday**: We know this number is 50 buyers.

2. **Number of buyers yesterday**: According to the problem, there were half the number of buyers the day before yesterday, which means:
   \[
   \text{Buyers yesterday} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Buyers the day before} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

3. **Number of buyers today**: We know there are 40 more buyers today than yesterday. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Buyers today} = \text{Buyers yesterday} + 40 = 25 + 40 = 65
   \]

4. **Calculate total buyers over three days**:
   \[
   \text{Total buyers} = \text{Buyers the day before} + \text{Buyers yesterday} + \text{Buyers today}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total buyers} = 50 + 25 + 65 = 140
   \]

So, the total number of buyers who've visited the store in the three days is 140.

- Day Before Yesterday: 50 buyers
- Yesterday: 25 buyers
- Today: 65 buyers

Adding these up together:
\[ 50 + 25 + 65 = 140 \]
