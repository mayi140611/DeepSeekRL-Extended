###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Aisha enjoys listening to music on her mp3 player. She starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player, then adds another 500 the week after that. She realizes her mp3 player has a large capacity for storing songs so she adds twice the amount she already had on her mp3 player. After a while, though, she decides that she doesn't like 50 of the songs and removes them. How many songs are on Aisha's mp3 player now?

1. Aisha starts with 500 songs.
2. She adds another 500 songs the week after, so she has \( 500 + 500 = 1000 \) songs.
3. She then adds twice the amount she already had, which is \( 2 \times 1000 = 2000 \) songs. So now she has \( 1000 + 2000 = 3000 \) songs.
4. She removes 50 songs that she doesn't like, so the total number of songs on her mp3 player is \( 3000 - 50 = 2950 \).

The final amount of songs on her mp3 player is 2950.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Aisha has 500 songs on her mp3 player.
2. The next week, she adds another 500 songs. So now she has \(500 + 500 = 1000\) songs.
3. She then adds twice the amount she already had on her mp3 player. Twice 500 is 1000, so she adds another 1000 songs. Now she has \(1000 + 1000 = 2000\) songs.
4. After a while, she removes 50 songs that she doesn't like. Now she has \(2000 - 50 = 1950\) songs.

Therefore, the total number of songs on her mp3 player now is 1950.

To determine the total number of songs on Aisha's mp3 player, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of songs, which is 500.
2. Add another 500 songs from the second week, making it a total of 500 + 500 = 1000 songs.
3. Aisha then adds twice the amount she already had, which is 2 * 1000 = 2000 songs.
4. Her mp3 player's storage capacity allows for this addition, so no songs get removed during this step.
5. Finally, Aisha removes 50 songs that she doesn't like. This is a subtraction operation: 2000 - 50.

So, the final number of songs on her mp3 player is 2000 - 50 = 1950.

Initially, Aisha has 500 songs. Then she adds 500 more songs, so she has 500 + 500 = 1000 songs. After adding that, she multiplies the number of songs by 2, which means she adds 1000*2 = 2000 more songs. Now, she has 1000 + 2000 = 3000 songs.

Initially, Aisha has 500 songs on her mp3 player. After the first week, she adds another 500 songs. So, the total number of songs becomes:

\[500 + 500 = 1000\]

Then, she adds twice the amount she already had, which means she adds:

\[2 \times 1000 = 2000\]

So, the total number of songs on her mp3 player now is:

\[1000 + 2000 = 3000\]

After removing 50 songs, the number of songs on her mp3 player is:
