To determine how many days it will take for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae, we can start by understanding the growth pattern of the amoebae.

Given:
- Each amoeba reproduces every 2 days.
- We start with 1 amoeba.

We need to find out how many 2-day periods are required for the amoebae to multiply by a factor of 16.

Let's break it down:
1. After 2 days, the amoeba will divide into 2 amoebae.
2. After 4 days, the 2 amoebae will each divide, resulting in 4 amoebae.
3. After 6 days, the 4 amoebae will each divide, resulting in 8 amoebae.
4. After 8 days, the 8 amoebae will each divide, resulting in 16 amoebae.

So, it will take 8 days for the amoeba to reproduce into 16 amoebae.

After the first two days, one amoeba grows to four. After the next two days, it grows to eight. Hence it grows to sixteen after the next four days.

So it takes 4 days for the amoeba to grow to sixteen.

To determine how many days it will take for an amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae, we need to understand the process of exponential growth in this context. Since an amoeba reproduces every 2 days and each amoeba reproduces to become two, we can calculate the number of days required for the population to grow from 1 to 16.

Starting with 1 amoeba:
1. After 2 days, each amoeba will reproduce, adding 1 more amoeba. Now we have 2 amoebae.
2. After another 2 days, each of these 2 amoebae will reproduce, adding 2 more amoebae. Now we have 4 amoebae.
3. After another 2 days, each of these 4 amoebae will reproduce, adding 4 more amoebae. Now we have 8 amoebae.
4. After another 2 days, each of these 8 amoebae will reproduce, adding 8 more amoebae. Now we have 16 amoebae.

We can see that each step of reproduction doubles the number of amoebae. Therefore, to go from 1 amoeba to 16 amoebae, we need to double the number of amoebae 4 times.

So, the number of days required is:
4 days

After the first two days, one original amoeba splits into two.
After the third day, they each split into two, resulting in four amoebae.
After the fourth day, each of the four amoebae splits into two, resulting in eight amoebae.
After the fifth and sixth days, each amoeba splits into two, resulting in sixteen amoebae.

Thus, it will take 6 days for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

To determine how many days it will take for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae, we need to consider the growth pattern of the amoebae. Since the amoeba reproduces every two days and each reproduction doubles the number of amoebae, we can calculate the number of days required for the amoebae to reach 16 amoebae.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the growth pattern**: The amoeba reproduces every 2 days. This means each day, the number of amoebae doubles.

2. **Determine the number of doublings needed**: We need 16 amoebae. Since each reproduction doubles the number of amoebae, we need to find out how many doublings are required to reach 16 amoebae starting from 1 amoeba.

3. **Calculate the number of doublings**: 
   - Start with 1 amoeba.
   - After 2 days, the amoeba will have reproduced once, resulting in 2 amoebae.
   - After 4 days, the amoeba will have reproduced twice, resulting in 4 amoebae.
   - After 6 days, the amoeba will have reproduced three times, resulting in 8 amoebae.
   - After 8 days, the amoeba will have reproduced four times, resulting in 16 amoebae.

4. **Conclusion**: It will take 8 days for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

Thus, the number of days required is 8 days.

To solve this problem, we need to understand that an amoeba will double in number every two days. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, we have 1 amoeba.
2. After 2 days, the first amoeba will divide into 2 amoebae.
3. After another 2 days (4 days total), the 2 amoebae will each divide, resulting in 4 amoebae.
4. This process continues, with the number of amoebae doubling every two days.

We need to find how many days it will take to reach 16 amoebae.

To determine this, let's work backwards from 16 amoebae:

1. 16 amoebae are given.
2. To reach 16 amoebae, we need to divide by 2 once more to get the middle number: 16 / 2 = 8 amoebae.
3. We then divide 8 by 2 again to get the number of days before doubling: 8 / 2 = 4 days.
4. This means that after 4 days, we have 1st half of 8 amoebae. To cover all 8 amoebae, we need 2 more days of doubling: 4 + 2 = 6 days.

So, 6 days is the total number of days it will take for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

Every two days one amoeba fissions and divides into two amoebae. To find out in how many days a single amoeba would fission into 16 amoebae, we use the formula:

Number of amoebae = Initial number of amoebae * Number of amoebae every two days

So:

Number of amoebae = 1 * 2^n, where n is the number of "two-day" intervals.

Setting this equal to 16 and solving for n:

16 = 2^n

Taking the logarithm on both sides:

log(16) = n * log(2)

n = log(16) / log(2) â‰ˆ 4

So 16 amoebae would take approximately 4 days to fission. Now we know this means there are two two-day periods, 4 days total.

However, each two-day period consists of two days, so the total number of days it takes for one amoeba to divide into 16 is:

2 * 4 = 8 days.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial Stage:** We start with 1 amoeba.
2. **First Reproduction Cycle:** After 2 days, each amoeba splits into 2 amoebae.
   - So, 1 + 1 = 2 amoebae.

3. **Second Reproduction Cycle:** After another 2 days (which is a total of 4 days),
   - Each of the 2 amoebae from the first cycle splits into 2.
   - So, 2 amoebae + 2 amoebae = 4 amoebae.

4. **Continuing the Pattern:** We continue this process. After another 2 days (another 4 days total),
   - Each of the 4 amoebae from the second cycle splits into 2.
   - So, 4 amoebae + 4 amoebae = 8 amoebae.

5. **Third Reproduction Cycle:** After another 2 days (another 4 days total),
   - Each of the 8 amoebae from the third cycle splits into 2.
   - So, 8 amoebae + 8 amoebae = 16 amoebae.

By adding up the time periods we calculated:
- 2 days (initial) + 2 days (first cycle) + 2 days (second cycle) + 2 days (third cycle) = 8 days in total.

Therefore, it will take **8 days** for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

To determine how many days it will take for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae, we need to understand the growth pattern of the amoebae. Since an amoeba splits into two every two days, we can use the formula for exponential growth. However, in this case, we are dealing with the doubling every two days, so we can simplify the problem by considering the doubling time.

If one amoeba splits into two every two days, then it takes 2 days to go from 1 amoeba to 2 amoebae. To get from 1 amoeba to 16 amoebae, we need to go from 1 to 16, which is 15 doublings.

So, we need 15 doublings in 15 times the doubling time of 2 days each.

Calculation:
15 doublings = 15 * 2 = 30 days.

Therefore, it will take 30 days for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

After the first split, the amoeba has 2 amoebae after 2 days.

2 amoebae from the first day split again with each amoeba splitting into 2, so 2 x 2 = 4 amoebae after the second day.

With the 4 amoebae from the first day, each amoeba splits into 2, so 4 x 2 = 8 amoebae after the third day.

With the 8 amoebae from the first and second days, each amoeba splits into 2, so 8 x 2 = 16 amoebae after the fourth day.

So, it takes 4 days for 1 amoeba to reproduce to 16 amoebae.

To determine how many days it will take for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae, we need to understand the pattern of reproduction. An amoeba splits into two every two days. Therefore, we can deduce the number of days required by considering the doubling process.

If we start with 1 amoeba and it splits into 2 amoebae after 2 days, it will take an additional 2 days to split each of those 2 amoebae into 2 more amoebae. Therefore, the number of days to reach the 4th generation (which is twice the number of days to reach the first generation) is 4 days. 

This pattern repeats every 4 days, as the number of amoebae doubles every 2 days and then starts a new cycle every 4 days.

So, to reach 16 amoebae, we need 4 cycles of 2 days, which is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) days.

To solve this problem, we need to understand that each generation of amoebae doubles. If we start with 1 amoeba and it splits every 2 days, we can represent this as a geometric progression. The number of amoebae after \(n\) generations is given by \(2^n\).

We need to find the number of generations \(n\) such that the number of amoebae is 16. So we set up the equation:
\[2^n = 16\]

We know that \(16 = 2^4\), so:
\[2^n = 2^4\]

This implies:
\[n = 4\]

Therefore, it will take 4 generations for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

To determine how many days it will take for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae, we need to understand the process of reproduction and how the numbers grow.

An amoeba reproduces by splitting into two. This means that every 2 days, the number of amoebae doubles. We need to find out how many times this doubling process must occur to reach 16 amoebae.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial amoeba**: 1
2. **Day 2**: 1 amoeba (after the first 2 days, it splits into two)
3. **Day 4**: 2 amoebae (after the second 2 days, each of the 1 amoebae from Day 2 splits into two)

At this point, we have 4 amoebae. We need to continue the process for more doubles to get to 16 amoebae.

4. **Day 6**: 4 amoebae (after the third 2 days, each of the 2 amoebae from Day 4 splits into two)
5. **Day 8**: 8 amoebae (after the fourth 2 days, each of the 4 amoebae from Day 6 splits into two)
6. **Day 10**: 16 amoebae (after the fifth 2 days, each of the 8 amoebae from Day 8 splits into two)

So, it will take an additional 8 days from the start to reach 16 amoebae. Adding this to the initial 2 days gives us a total of 10 days.

Therefore, it will take 10 days for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.
