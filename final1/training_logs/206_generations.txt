###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

There are some lions in Londolozi at first. Lion cubs are born at the rate of 5 per month and lions die at the rate of 1 per month. If there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, how many lions were there in Londolozi at first?

The population of lions does not change in terms of births and deaths over a year because the rate of increase of births is equal to the rate of decrease of deaths. Hence, there won't be any net change in the population of lions over 1 year. Therefore, the number of lions remains the same.

To determine the initial number of lions in Londolozi, we need to consider the number of lions added and the number of lions that died over the course of 1 year. The problem states that lion cubs are born at a rate of 5 per month and lions die at a rate of 1 per month.

First, calculate the total number of births and deaths over 1 year:
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Lion cubs are born at a rate of 5 per month.
  \[
  \text{Total births} = 5 \text{ cubs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ cubs} \text{ born}
  \]
- Lions die at a rate of 1 per month.
  \[
  \text{Total deaths} = 1 \text{ lion/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ lions died}
  \]

Next, calculate the net change in the number of lions after 1 year:
\[
\text{Net change} = \text{Total births} + \text{Total deaths} = 60 \text{ cubs born} - 12 \text{ lions died} = 48 \text{ lions increased}
\]

Given that there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, we can find the initial number of lions by subtracting the net change from the final count:
\[
\text{Initial number of lions} = \text{Final number of lions} - \text{Net change}
\]
\[
\text{Initial number of lions} = 148 \text{ lions} - 48 \text{ lions} = 100 \text{ lions}
\]

Thus, the number of lions in Londolozi at first was 100.

Let's denote the number of lions at first as \( x \).

Each month, there is an increase in the number of lions by \( 5 - 1 = 4 \) lions (since 5 lion cubs are born and 1 lion dies).

After 1 year (which is 12 months), the number of lions in Londolozi would be the initial number of lions plus the total increase in lions over the year.

So, if there are 148 lions after 1 year, we can represent this as:
\[ x + 12 \times 4 = 148 \]

Now we can solve for \( x \) to find how many lions were there at first.

\[ x + 48 = 148 \]

\[ x = 148 - 48 \]

\[ x = 100 \]

After 1 year, 12 months, 5 - 1 = 4 more lions are born compared to the deaths. So, the difference in the number of lions is 4 * 12 = 48 more lions. If there are 148 lions after 1 year, initially, there were 148 - 48 = 100 lions at first.

After one year, 5-1=4 more lions are born than die resulting in an increase of 4 lions per month.
This results in 12*4=48 more lions after one year.
Thus, initially there were 148-48=100 lions in Londolozi.

Let's calculate the net change in the lion population over one year.

During one year, there are 12 months. In 12 months, the birth rate would be 5 lions per month * 12 = 60 lions.
In 12 months, the death rate would be 1 lion per month * 12 = 12 lions.

The net increase in lion population would be the birth rate minus the death rate, which is 60 - 12 = 48 lions.

After one year, there are 148 lions in total. So, the initial number of lions at the start of the year can be calculated as:

148 lions (after one year) - 48 lions (net increase in one year) = 100 lions (initial number at the start of the year).

Let's denote the number of lions initially in Londolozi as \( x \). Lions are increasing at a rate of \( 5 \) per month and decreasing at a rate of \( 1 \) per month. Consequently, the net increase in the number of lions per month is \( 5 - 1 = 4 \) lions.

Over the course of one year (12 months), the total increase in the number of lions is \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) lions. Therefore, the number of lions after one year can be expressed as:
\[
x + 48
\]

According to the problem, after one year, there are 148 lions in Londolozi. So we can set up the equation:
\[
x + 48 = 148
\]

To find the initial number of lions \( x \), we subtract 48 from both sides:
\[
x = 148 - 48
\]

Thus,
\[
x = 100
\]

So, the number of lions initially in Londolozi was 100.

Let's denote the initial number of lions in Londolozi as \( x \).

The rate at which new lions are added is 5 per month, and the rate at which lions die is 1 per month. Therefore, the net increase in the number of lions per month is \( 5 - 1 = 4 \) lions. Over the course of a year, which has 12 months, the total net increase in the number of lions is \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) lions.

After one year, the number of lions in Londolozi is given as 148. Therefore, the initial number of lions \( x \) can be calculated by subtracting the total increase from the current number of lions.

\[ x = 148 - 48 \]
\[ x = 100 \]
