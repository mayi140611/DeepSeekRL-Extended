<reasoning>
1. The zoo has 16 pandas.
2. Each couple (mate) consists of 2 pandas.
3. Therefore, the total number of panda couples is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
4. Only 25% of these couples get pregnant.
5. So, the number of couples that get pregnant is \( 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \).
6. Each pregnant couple has one baby.
7. Therefore, the total number of panda babies born is \( 2 \).

To determine how many panda babies are born, we need to calculate the number of panda couples that get pregnant and then add that number to the total number of pandas, since each pregnant couple will have one baby.

Given:
- The zoo has 16 pandas, which are paired into 8 couples (since 16 pandas / 2 pandas per couple = 8 couples).
- Only 25% of the panda couples get pregnant after mating.

First, we calculate the number of pregnant panda couples:
\[ 8 \text{ couples} \times 25\% = 8 \text{ couples} \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ pregnant couples} \]

Since each pregnant couple has one baby, the total number of panda babies born is:
\[ 2 \text{ babies} \]

Therefore, 2 panda babies are born.

To determine the number of panda babies born, we first need to calculate the number of panda couples that get pregnant. Since there are 16 pandas and they are paired into mates, there are 16/2 = 8 panda couples.

Only 25% of these couples get pregnant. So, the number of panda couples that get pregnant is 8 * 25% = 2 panda couples.

Each panda couple that gets pregnant has one baby. Therefore, the total number of panda babies born is 2 (since there are 2 panda couples).

To determine how many panda babies are born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of panda couples in the zoo.
2. Determine how many of these couples get pregnant.
3. Find out how many couples each have one baby.

First, since there are 16 pandas and they are paired into couples, there are 8 couples in the zoo (because 16 / 2 = 8).

Next, since only 25% of the panda couples get pregnant, we calculate:
\[ 8 \text{ couples} \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ couples} \]

Each of these 2 couples gives birth to one baby, resulting in 2 babies being born.

So, the total number of panda babies born is 2.

To determine how many panda babies are born, we need to first calculate the number of panda couples that will mate. Since there are 16 pandas and they are paired into couples, there will be \(16 / 2 = 8\) couples.

Given that only 25% of the panda couples get pregnant, we calculate the number of pregnant couples as follows:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ pregnant couples} \]

Each pregnant couple will have one baby, so the total number of pandas that will be born is:
\[ 2 \text{ babies} \]

To determine how many panda babies are born, we first need to calculate the number of panda couples that get pregnant. There are 16 pandas, paired into 8 couples. Since 25% of these couples get pregnant, we can find the number of pregnant couples by calculating 25% of 8:

\[ \text{Number of pregnant couples} = 8 \times \frac{25}{100} = 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \]

Each of these 2 pregnant panda couples will give birth to one baby. Therefore, the total number of panda babies born is:

Since there are 16 pandas paired into mates, this means there are 16 couples. Only 25% of these couples get pregnant, so we need to calculate 25% of 16. 

\[ 25\% \times 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

This means that 4 couples get pregnant. Each couple has one baby, so the total number of baby pandas born is 4.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The zoo has 16 pandas, and they are paired into mates, meaning there are 16 pandas and 8 mated pairs.
2. Only 25% of the panda couples get pregnant after mating. This means that 25% of the 8 pairs is 0.25 * 8 = 2 panda couples will get pregnant.
3. Each of these 2 pregnant couples will give birth to one baby, so a total of 2 panda babies will be born.

Therefore, the number of panda babies born is 2.

To determine the number of panda babies born, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 25% of the total number of panda couples, which means 25% of 16 couples.
2. Each panda couple having one baby results in the birth of one baby.

We can use simple multiplication for this calculation:

\[ 25\% = 0.25 \]
\[ 0.25 \text{ of 16} = 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \]

Thus, 4 panda babies are born.

Pandas are usually monogamous and mate for life. Therefore, there is only one mating for each couple. Since there are 16 pandas, there are 16 mating pairs. Only 25% of these pairs will get pregnant. To find out how many pandas will have babies, we calculate 25% of 16. 
\[ 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]
This means 4 panda couples will have one baby each.

First, we need to determine the number of panda couples at the zoo. Since there are 16 pandas, they are paired into mates, which means there are 16/2 = <<16/2=8>>8 couples. 

Next, we are told that only 25% of the panda couples get pregnant after mating. Therefore, the number of couples that get pregnant is 8 * 0.25 = <<8*0.25=2>>2.

Since each couple has one baby, the total number of panda babies born is 2.
