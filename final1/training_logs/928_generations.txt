Maia gets 6 client requests every day and works on 4 of them each day. So each day, she has 6 - 4 = 2 client requests remaining to work on.

After 5 days, the total number of client requests remaining to work on will be 5 * 2 = 10.

Maia receives 6 client requests every day and works on 4 of them each day. To find out how many requests she has remaining to work on after 5 days, we first need to determine how many requests she works on in 5 days. 
On a daily basis, she works on 4 out of 6 requests, so she works on \( \frac{4}{6} \times 5 = 4 \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{20}{6} = 3\frac{2}{3} \) requests in 5 days. This can be interpreted as exactly 3 and 2/3 requests, meaning she works on 3 requests out of every 3 days, and another request on the final day.

Therefore, after 5 days, she will have worked on \( 3\frac{2}{3} \) requests, and will have \( 6 - \frac{2}{3} = 5 \frac{1}{3} \) requests remaining for her next 5 day work schedule.

We denote this remaining request as \( 5 \frac{1}{3} \) or \( 5 \frac{1}{3} \).

To find out how many client requests Maia will have remaining to work on after 5 days, we first need to calculate the total number of client requests she will have worked on after 5 days.

Maia gets 6 client requests every day. So, after 5 days, she will have worked on:
\[ 6 \text{ client requests/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ client requests} \]

Since she works on four articles each day, the number of client requests she will have worked on in total after 5 days is:
\[ 4 \text{ articles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ articles} \]

Therefore, the number of client requests she will have remaining to work on after 5 days is:
\[ 30 \text{ client requests} - 20 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ articles per client} = 30 - 80 = -50 \text{ client requests} \]

However, since she can't have a negative number of client requests, it's clear that she would have completed all her client requests by the end of the 5 days. So, after working on 20 articles (4 articles per day for 5 days), she will have worked on all her client requests and will have none left.

So, the number of client requests remaining to work on after 5 days is 0.

Maia gets 6 client requests every day and works on 4 of them each day. To find out how many requests she has to work on each day, we subtract the number of requests she works on from the total number of requests she gets. 
6 - 4 = 2 requests per day.

After 5 days, if she continues to get 6 requests each day, she would have received 5 * 6 = 30 requests. Since she works on 4 requests per day, she will have worked on 5 * 4 = 20 requests. 
The number of requests remaining is 30 - 20 = 10 requests.

Therefore, Maia will have 10 client requests remaining to work on after 5 days.

<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the number of client requests Maia will have worked on for the five days. If she works on four articles for each of the six requests each day, it means she works on \(4 \times 6 = 24\) articles each day. Over 5 days, this will be \(24 \times 5 = 120\) articles.

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of requests she receives each day to find out how many articles she has left to work on. Since she gets 6 requests every day, after working on 120 articles, she will have \(6 - 120 = -114\) requests left to work on. This indicates the negative value suggests she has worked on more requests than she has received, meaning she has worked on more requests than she has received in total over the five days, which is not possible. Therefore, we should assume she has completed all the articles she has been assigned.

If she has completed all the articles she has been assigned, she will have no client requests left to work on.

Maia gets 6 client requests every day and works on 4 of them each day. This means she can work on \(6 - 4 = 2\) requests each day. Over 5 days, she can work on \(2 \times 5 = 10\) requests. Since she starts with 6 client requests each day, after working on 5 days, the total number of requests she has worked on is 10. 

To find out how many requests she has remaining to work on after 5 days, we subtract the number of requests worked on from the total number of requests she gets each day:

\[6 \text{ requests/day} - 10 \text{ requests} = -4 \text{ requests remaining}\]

This calculation implies that she will be short of 4 requests by the end of 5 days. So the number of requests remaining to work on after 5 days is 0 because she has completed all her requests.

To determine how many client requests Maia will have remaining to work on after 5 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of client requests she receives in 5 days.
2. Calculate the total number of client requests she handles (works on) in 5 days.
3. Subtract the number of requests worked on from the total number of requests received to find the remaining requests.

Let's go through the calculations:

1. Total requests in 5 days:
   Maia gets 6 client requests every day, so in 5 days, she will receive:
   \( 6 \text{ requests/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ requests} \)

2. Total requests worked on in 5 days:
   Maia works on 4 client requests every day, so in 5 days, she will handle:
   \( 4 \text{ requests/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ requests} \)

3. Remaining requests:
   To find the remaining requests, subtract the number of requests worked on from the total number of requests received:
   \( 30 \text{ requests} - 20 \text{ requests} = 10 \text{ requests} \)

So, after 5 days, Maia will have 10 client requests remaining to work on.

Maia gets 6 client requests every day and she works on 4 of them. Therefore, the number of client requests she has left to work on each day is 6 - 4 = 2 requests.

Over 5 days, the total number of client requests she will have left to work on is 2 requests/day x 5 days = 10 requests.

Maia receives 6 client requests every day and works on 4 of them each day. 
So each day, she is left with \(6 - 4 = 2\) requests.

After working on 5 days, she would have worked on a total of \(5 \times 4 = 20\) requests.

The number of requests left to work on after 5 days would be \(20 - 2 = 18\).

Maia receives 6 client requests each day. She works on 4 of them each day. To find out how many are remaining after working on 4 each day, we subtract the number of requests she works on from the total number of requests received. Let's perform these calculations:

Requests received per day: 6
Requests worked on per day: 4
Remaining requests after 5 days: 

6 - 4 = 2

So, Maia has 2 client requests remaining per day.

For 5 days, she would have:

2 client requests per day * 5 days = 10 client requests remaining.

To determine how many client requests Maia will have remaining to work on after 5 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of client requests Maia works on in one day.
2. Calculate the total number of client requests she works on in 5 days.
3. Subtract the number of client requests worked on in 5 days from the total number of client requests she receives in a day.

Step 1: 
Maia gets 6 client requests every day.
Step 2:
In 5 days, the total number of client requests worked on would be \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) requests.

Step 3:
Total client requests received in one day: 6
Remaining requests after 5 days: \( 6 - 30 = -24 \)

However, this result indicates that Maia would have completed all of the requests she received in a day by the end of the 5th day, and thus would not have any requests left to work on.

So, she will have 0 client requests remaining to work on after 5 days.

1. Calculate the total number of client requests Maia receives in one day.
   Maia receives 6 client requests every day.

2. Calculate the total number of client requests Maia receives in 5 days.
   Since she receives 6 client requests every day, in 5 days she will receive:
   \[ 6 \text{ requests/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ requests} \]

3. Calculate the total number of client requests Maia works on in one day.
   Maia works on 4 client requests every day.

4. Calculate the total number of client requests Maia works on in 5 days.
   Since she works on 4 client requests every day, in 5 days she will work on:
   \[ 4 \text{ requests/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ requests} \]

5. Calculate the number of client requests remaining after 5 days.
   Since she receives 30 client requests in 5 days and works on 20 of them, the number of requests remaining is:
   \[ 30 \text{ requests} - 20 \text{ requests} = 10 \text{ requests} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Maia will have 10 client requests remaining to work on.

If she has 2 requests remaining each day, and we want to find out how many requests she will have left after 5 days, we multiply the remaining requests per day by 5:

Maia receives 6 client requests every day. She works on 4 of them each day. To find out how many client requests she has left to work on each day, we subtract the number of requests she works on from the total number of requests she gets:

Total requests per day: 6
Requests worked on per day: 4

Remaining requests per day = Total requests per day - Requests worked on per day
Remaining requests per day = 6 - 4 = 2

Maia receives 6 client requests every day and works on 4 of them each day, so she has 2 client requests remaining to work on each day.

After 5 days, the total number of remaining client requests would be:
Remaining requests per day = 2
Number of days = 5

Total remaining requests = Remaining requests per day * Number of days
Total remaining requests = 2 * 5 = 10

Therefore, Maia will have 10 client requests remaining to work on after 5 days.
