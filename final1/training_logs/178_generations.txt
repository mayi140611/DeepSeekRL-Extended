###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Simon wanted to buy flowers that his mom could plant for Mother's Day.  The garden center was offering 10% off all purchases.  He bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each, one hydrangea that cost $12.50 and 5 petunias that cost $1.00 each.  If he paid with a $50 bill, how much change would Simon receive back from his purchase?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Simon bought 5 pansies x $2.50 = $12.50 for the pansies.
He bought 5 petunias x $1 = $5 for the petunias.
He bought one hydrangea x $12.50 = $12.50 for the hydrangea.
The total is $12.50 + $12.50 + $5 + $12.50 = $42.50.
10% off is 42. 50 x .10 = $4.25.
The total after discount is 42. 50 - 4. 25 = $38. 25.
If he paid with a $50 bill, he would get change of 50 - 38. 25 = $11. 75.

Simon paid for 5+1+5 = 11 items
5 pansies at $2.50 each means 5*2.50 = $12.50
The hydrangea costs $12. 50 and the 5 petunias cost 5*1 = $5
The total before the discount is 12. 50+12. 50+5 = $30. 00
After the 10% discount, he only pays 100% - 10% = 90% of the price
90% of 30. 00 is . 90*30 = $27
If he pays with a $50 bill, he receives 50-27 = $23 in change

Simon bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each, one hydrangea that cost $12.50 and 5 petunias that cost $1.00 each. The total cost of the pansies is 5 * $2.50 = $12.50. The total cost of the hydrangea is $12.50. The total cost of the petunias is 5 * $1.00 = $5.00. The total cost of all the plants without the discount is $12.50 + $12.50 + $5.00 = $30.00. The plant is offering 10% off so the discount is 10/100 * $30.00 = $3.00. The total amount Simon spent is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00. Simon paid with a $50.00 bill, so the change he received is $50.00 - $27.00 = $23.00.

Simon bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each, so the total cost for the pansies is 5 * $2.50 = $12.50.
He bought one hydrangea that costs $12.50.
He also bought 5 petunias at $1.00 each, so the total cost for the petunias is 5 * $1.00 = $5.

The total cost of the flowers is $12.50 + $12.50 + $5 = $30.
The garden center is offering a 10% discount, so the total cost after the discount is 90% of $30 = $27.

Simon paid with a $50 bill, so his change would be $50 - $27 = $23.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers before the discount. Simon bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each, 1 hydrangea that cost $12.50, and 5 petunias at $1.00 each.

Total cost of pansies: 5 p 2.50 = $12.50
Total cost of hydrangea: 12.50
Total cost of petunias: 5 1.00 = $5.00

Now, add up all the costs to get the total:

Total spent before discount: 12.50 + 12.50 + 5.00 = $30.00

The garden center is offering a 10% discount on all purchases. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30.00:

Discount amount: 30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Simon needs to pay:

Final amount to pay: 30.00 - 3.00 = $27.00

Simon paid with a $50 bill, so to find out how much change he would receive, we subtract the final amount to pay from $50.00:

Change: 50.00 - 27.00 = $23.00

Simon's total purchase before the discount is 5*2.5 + 12.5 + 5*1 = 25 dollars.
The discount Simon gets is 25*.1 = 2.5 dollars.
The total amount Simon had to pay is 25 - 2.5 = 22.5 dollars.
Simon paid with a $50 bill and received 50 - 22.5 = 27.5 dollars in change.

Simon's total purchase was 5 pansies at $2.50 each, one hydrangea that cost $12.50 and 5 petunias that cost $1.00 each. So his purchase was $2.50 x 5 + $12.50 + $1.00 x 5 = $12.50 + $12.50 + $5.00 = $20.00. The garden center offered a 10% discount on his purchase so he only paid for $20.00 - $20.00 x .10 = $18.00. He paid with a $50 bill so he received $50.00 - $18.00 = $32.00 in change.

Each pansy costs $2.50, so the total for 5 pansies is 5 * $2.50 = $12.50.
The hydrangea costs $12.50.
Each petunia costs $1.00, so the total for 5 petunias is 5 * $1.00 = $5.00.
The total purchase amount is $12.50 + $12.50 + $5.00 = $30.00.
With a 10% discount, Simon is actually paying 100% - 10% = 90%.
So, the amount he paid is $30.00 * 90% = $27.00.
He paid with a $50 dollar bill, so his change is $50.00 - $27.00 = $23.00.

The discount for the 10% off offer was applied to $50.00 - $12.50 = $37.50. Simon would receive $37.50 * 10% = $3.75 off. Simon would then have $37.50 - $3.75 = $33.75 to pay for the plants.
