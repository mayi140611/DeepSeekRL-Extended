system
To find out how many English-language books have been published outside the country, we first determine the number of English-language books in total, which is 80% of 2300.

\[
\text{Number of English-language books} = 0.80 \times 2300 = 1840
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these English-language books have been published outside the country. Since 60% of the English-language books were published in the country, the remaining 40% were published outside the country.

\[
\text{Number of books published outside the country} = 0.40 \times 1840 = 736
\]

To find the number of English-language books published outside the country, we first need to calculate the number of English-language books and then determine how many of those were published outside the country.

1. Calculate the number of English-language books:
   80% of 2300 books are in English.
   \[
   0.80 \times 2300 = 1840 \text{ English books}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of these English-language books that were published in the country:
   60% of the English-language books were published in the country.
   \[
   0.60 \times 1840 = 1104 \text{ English-language books published in the country}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of English-language books published outside the country:
   Subtract the number of English-language books published in the country from the total number of English-language books.
   \[
   1840 - 1104 = 736 \text{ English-language books published outside the country}
   \]

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, calculate the total number of English-language books:
\[2300 \times 0.80 = 1840\]

2. Next, calculate how many of these English-language books were published in the country:
\[1840 \times 0.60 = 1104\]

3. Finally, we subtract the number of English-language books published in the country from the total number of English-language books to find out how many were published outside the country:
\[1840 - 1104 = 736\]

So, there are 736 English-language books that have been published outside the country.

To find out how many English-language books have been published outside the country, we first need to calculate the total number of English-language books. Since 80% of all the books are in English, we multiply the total number of books by 0.80:

\[ 2300 \times 0.80 = 1840 \]

So, there are 1840 English-language books in the library.

Next, we need to find out how many of these English-language books were published outside the country. We know that 60% of the English books were published in the country, which means 40% were published outside the country (since 100% - 60% = 40%).

\[ 1840 \times 0.40 = 736 \]

Therefore, there are 736 English-language books published outside the country.
