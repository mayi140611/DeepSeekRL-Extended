To determine how much older Jolyn is than Leon, we need to establish the age difference between Jolyn and Leon by comparing their ages to the ages of the other classmates.

1. We know that Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.
2. Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese.
3. Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.

Let's denote the age of Aivo as \( A \).

From the information given:
- Therese's age: \( A + 5 \)
- Jolyn's age: \( (A + 5) + 2 = A + 7 \)
- Leon's age: \( A + 2 \)

Now, we need to find the difference between Jolyn's age and Leon's age:
\[ \text{Difference} = Jolyn's \; age - Leon's \; age \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (A + 7) - (A + 2) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = A + 7 - A - 2 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 \]

Therefore, Jolyn is 5 months older than Leon.

To determine how much older Jolyn is than Leon, we first need to establish the age difference between Jolyn and Therese, and then convert those differences into the same time unit, here we'll use months.

Given:
- Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese.
- Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.
- Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.

We can see that both Jolyn and Therese are related to Aivo by 2 months difference. This means Jolyn’s age is 2 months, and Therese’s age is 5 months (which is 3 months beyond Aivo’s age, and Aivo’s age is the same as Leon’s age, since the problem states Leon is 2 months older than Aivo).

So Jolyn is 2 months older than Leon.

To determine how much older Jolyn is than Leon, we need to establish the age differences between the classmates.

1. Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese.
2. Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.
3. Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.

First, let's express the age differences in terms of months:

4. Jolyn = Therese + 2
5. Therese = Aivo + 5
6. Leon = Aivo + 2

Now, to find Jolyn's age in terms of Leon's age:

7. Jolyn = (Aivo + 5) + 2
8. Jolyn = Aivo + 7

Finally, to find how much older Jolyn is than Leon:

9. Jolyn's age difference with Leon = (Aivo + 7) - (Aivo + 2)
10. Jolyn's age difference with Leon = 7 - 2
11. Jolyn's age difference with Leon = 5

So, Jolyn is 5 months older than Leon.

To determine how much older Jolyn is than Leon, we need to establish the age differences between the classmates based on their given relationships.

First, let's denote the ages of Jolyn, Therese, Aivo, and Leon as follows:
- Let \( J \) be Jolyn's age.
- Let \( T \) be Therese's age.
- Let \( A \) be Aivo's age.
- Let \( L \) be Leon's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese: \( J = T + 2 \)
2. Therese is 5 months older than Aivo: \( T = A + 5 \)
3. Leon is 2 months older than Aivo: \( L = A + 2 \)

We need to find out how much older Jolyn is than Leon. This can be calculated using the expressions for \( J \) and \( L \):
\[ J = T + 2 \]
\[ L = A + 2 \]

To find the difference in age between Jolyn and Leon, we subtract Leon's age from Jolyn's age:
\[ J - L = (T + 2) - (A + 2) \]
\[ J - L = T - A \]

From the second relationship \( T = A + 5 \), we can substitute \( T \) in the equation:
\[ J - L = (A + 5) - A \]
\[ J - L = 5 \]

Therefore, Jolyn is \(\boxed{5}\) months older than Leon.

1. **Establish relationships:**
   - Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese.
   - Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.
   - Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.

2. **Express all relationships in terms of Jolyn's age:**
   - Let \( J \) represent Jolyn's age.
   - Then, Therese's age \( T \) is \( J - 2 \) (since Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese).
   - Aivo's age \( A \) is \( T - 5 \) (since Therese is 5 months older than Aivo).
     Substituting \( T \) with \( J - 2 \), we get \( A = (J - 2) - 5 = J - 7 \).
   - Leon's age \( L \) is \( A + 2 \) (since Leon is 2 months older than Aivo).
     Substituting \( A \) with \( J - 7 \), we get \( L = (J - 7) + 2 = J - 5 \).

3. **Determine the difference in age between Jolyn and Leon:**
   - Jolyn's age: \( J \)
   - Leon's age: \( J - 5 \)

Let's denote the age in months of Jolyn, Therese, Aivo, and Leon as \( J \), \( T \), \( A \), and \( L \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. \( J = T + 2 \)
2. \( T = A + 5 \)
3. \( L = A + 2 \)

We need to find how much older Jolyn is than Leon. 

First, let's express \( T \) and \( L \) in terms of \( A \):

From equation 2: \( T = A + 5 \)
From equation 3: \( L = A + 2 \)

Now we know:
\( T = A + 5 \)
\( L = A + 2 \)

Next, we find the difference \( T - L \):
\[ T - L = (A + 5) - (A + 2) \]
\[ T - L = A + 5 - A - 2 \]
\[ T - L = 5 - 2 \]
\[ T - L = 3 \]

So, Therese is 3 months older than Leon.

Therefore, the answer is that Jolyn is 3 months older than Leon.

To determine how much older Jolyn is than Leon in months, we need to establish the age differences step by step.

1. We know that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese.
2. Additionally, Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.
3. Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.

First, let's express the age differences in terms of months:
- Jolyn's age difference to Therese: \( J = 2 \)
- Therese's age difference to Aivo: \( T = 5 \)
- Leon's age difference to Aivo: \( L = 2 \)

We need to find the age difference between Jolyn and Leon. To do this, we add the age differences to find the total age difference between Jolyn and Leon.

\[
\text{Difference between Jolyn and Leon} = J + L - T
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Difference between Jolyn and Leon} = 2 + 2 - 5

Let's break down the information given:

1. Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese.
2. Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.
3. Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.

We need to find out how much older Jolyn is than Leon.

Step 1: Find Aivo's age relative to Leon.
Since Leon is 2 months older than Aivo, we can consider Leon's age as Aivo's age plus 2 months.

Step 2: Find Therese's age relative to Jolyn.
Since Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese, we can consider Therese's age as Jolyn's age minus 2 months.

Step 3: Find Aivo's age relative to Jolyn.
Since Therese is 5 months older than Aivo, we can consider Aivo's age as 5 months minus Therese's age.

Step 4: Calculate the difference in age between Jolyn and Leon.
To find how much older Jolyn is than Leon, we need to add together the difference between Jolyn and Therese (2 months) and the difference between Therese and Aivo (5 months).

Jolyn's age relative to Leon = Therese's age + 2 (from step 1) + Aivo's age - (5 - (Jolyn's age - 2)) (from step 2)

Now, let's calculate the difference:

Jolyn - Leon = (Jolyn's age - 2) + (5 - (Jolyn's age)) + 2
Jolyn - Leon = 7 + 2
Jolyn - Leon = 9 months

Therefore, Jolyn is 9 months older than Leon.

3. Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.

To find out how much older Jolyn is than Leon, we need to find the relationship between Jolyn and Leon.

From the first point, Jolyn = Therese + 2.
From the second point, Therese = Aivo + 5.
Therefore, Jolyn = (Aivo + 5) + 2 = Aivo + 7.

From the third point, Leon = Aivo + 2.

To find out how much older Jolyn is than Leon, we subtract Leon's age from Jolyn's age:
Jolyn's age - Leon's age = (Aivo + 7) - (Aivo + 2) = 7 - 2 = 5.

To determine how much older Jolyn is than Leon, we first need to establish the age differences based on the given information.

1. Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese.
2. Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.
3. Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.

First, let's express the age differences in terms of months.

- Therese's age difference from Aivo: 5 months
- Leon's age difference from Aivo: 2 months

Since Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese, and Therese is 5 months older than Aivo, we can calculate Jolyn's age difference from Aivo as follows:

Jolyn's age difference from Aivo = Therese's age difference from Aivo + Jolyn's age difference from Therese
Jolyn's age difference from Aivo = 5 months + 2 months = 7 months

Now, we can determine how much older Jolyn is than Leon by adding their age differences from Aivo:

Jolyn's age difference from Leon = Jolyn's age difference from Aivo + Leon's age difference from Aivo
Jolyn's age difference from Leon = 7 months + 2 months = 9 months

Therefore, Jolyn is 9 months older than Leon.

To determine how much older Jolyn is than Leon in months, we need to establish the relationship between Jolyn, Therese, Aivo, and Leon based on the given information.

1. **Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese.** This can be represented as:
   \[
   J = T + 2
   \]

2. **Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.** This can be represented as:
   \[
   T = A + 5
   \]

3. **Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.** This can be represented as:
   \[
   L = A + 2
   \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( T \) from the second equation into the first equation to express Jolyn's age in terms of Aivo's age:
\[
J = (A + 5) + 2 = A + 7
\]

Since \( L \) is given by the third equation:
\[
L = A + 2
\]

Next, we subtract the expression for \( L \) from the expression for \( J \) to find how much older Jolyn is than Leon:
\[
J - L = (A + 7) - (A + 2) = A + 7 - A - 2 = 5
