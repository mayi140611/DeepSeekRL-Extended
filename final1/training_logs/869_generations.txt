###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Apple and peach trees are planted in the orchard of the Grange Poser farm. The orchard has 30 apple trees that each give 150 kg of apples and 45 peach trees that each produce an average of 65 kg of fruit. What is the total mass of fruit harvested in this orchard?

<reasoning>
To find the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard, we need to calculate the total mass of apples and the total mass of peaches separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total mass of apples:
- There are 30 apple trees.
- Each apple tree yields 150 kg of apples.

\[ \text{Total mass of apples} = 30 \text{ trees} \times 150 \text{ kg/tree} = 4500 \text{ kg} \]

Next, let's calculate the total mass of peaches:
- There are 45 peach trees.
- Each peach tree yields an average of 65 kg of peaches.

\[ \text{Total mass of peaches} = 45 \text{ trees} \times 65 \text{ kg/tree} = 2925 \text{ kg} \]

Now we add the total mass of apples and peaches to get the total mass of fruit harvested:
\[ \text{Total mass of fruit} = 4500 \text{ kg} + 2925 \text{ kg} = 7425 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard is 7425 kg.

To find the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard, we need to calculate the total mass of apples and the total mass of peaches separately, and then add them together.

The total mass of apples harvested can be calculated as follows:
Total mass of apples = Number of apple trees * Mass of apples per tree
Total mass of apples = 30 trees * 150 kg/tree = 4500 kg

The total mass of peaches harvested can be calculated as follows:
Total mass of peaches = Number of peach trees * Average mass of peaches per tree
Total mass of peaches = 45 trees * 65 kg/tree = 2925 kg

Now we can add the total mass of apples and the total mass of peaches to get the total mass of fruit harvested:
Total mass of fruit = Total mass of apples + Total mass of peaches
Total mass of fruit = 4500 kg + 2925 kg = 7425 kg

Therefore, the total mass of fruit harvested in this orchard is 7425 kg.

To calculate the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard, we need to consider the contributions from both the apple trees and the peach trees.

1. **Apple Trees:**
   - There are 30 apple trees.
   - Each apple tree yields 150 kg of apples.
   - Therefore, the total mass of apples from all the apple trees is:
     \[
     30 \text{ trees} \times 150 \text{ kg/tree} = 4500 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Peach Trees:**
   - There are 45 peach trees.
   - Each peach tree yields an average of 65 kg of fruit.
   - Therefore, the total mass of fruit from all the peach trees is:
     \[
     45 \text{ trees} \times 65 \text{ kg/tree} = 2925 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Total Mass of Fruit:**
   - To find the total mass of fruit harvested, we add the mass of apples and the mass of peaches:
     \[
     4500 \text{ kg} + 2925 \text{ kg} = 7425 \text{ kg}
     \]

The total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard is 7425 kg.

To find the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard, we need to calculate the total mass of apples and the total mass of peaches separately, and then sum these two totals.

First, calculate the total mass of apples:
- There are 30 apple trees.
- Each apple tree yields 150 kg of apples.
- Therefore, the total mass of apples is \( 30 \times 150 = 4500 \) kg.

Next, calculate the total mass of peaches:
- There are 45 peach trees.
- Each peach tree yields an average of 65 kg of fruit.
- Therefore, the total mass of peaches is \( 45 \times 65 = 2925 \) kg.

Now, sum the total mass of apples and peaches to get the total fruit harvest:
- Total fruit harvest = \( 4500 \) kg (apples) + \( 2925 \) kg (peaches) = \( 7425 \) kg.

So, the total mass of fruit harvested in this orchard is \( 7425 \) kg.

The total mass of apples harvested from the apple trees can be calculated as follows:
Number of apple trees × Mass of apples per tree = 30 × 150 kg = 4500 kg

The total mass of peaches harvested from the peach trees can be calculated as follows:
Number of peach trees × Average mass of peaches per tree = 45 × 65 kg = 2925 kg

The total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard is the sum of the mass of apples and the mass of peaches:
4500 kg + 2925 kg = 7425 kg

Therefore, the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard is 7425 kg.

To determine the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard, we need to calculate the mass of apples and peaches separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total mass of apples:
- There are 30 apple trees.
- Each apple tree gives 150 kg of apples.

Total mass of apples = 30 × 150 kg = 4500 kg.

Next, let's calculate the total mass of peaches:
- There are 45 peach trees.
- Each peach tree produces an average of 65 kg of fruit.

Total mass of peaches = 45 × 65 kg = 2925 kg.

Now, to find the total mass of all the fruit, we add the total mass of apples and peaches:

Total mass of fruit = Total mass of apples + Total mass of peaches
                    = 4500 kg + 2925 kg = 7425 kg.

Therefore, the total mass of fruit harvested in this orchard is 7425 kg.

First, let's calculate the total mass of apples:

- Each apple tree yields 150 kg of apples.

Total mass of apples = Number of apple trees × Mass of apples per tree

Total mass of peaches = Number of peach trees × Mass of peaches per tree
Total mass of peaches = 45 × 65 kg
Total mass of peaches = 2925 kg

Now, to get the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard, we sum the total mass of apples and the total mass of peaches:
Total mass of fruit = Total mass of apples + Total mass of peaches
Total mass of fruit = 4500 kg + 2925 kg
Total mass of fruit = 7425 kg

Therefore, the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard is 7425 kg.
