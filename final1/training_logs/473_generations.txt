#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To determine how many members ordered orange juice, we start by calculating the number of members who ordered lemon juice.

There are 30 members in total, and two-fifths of them ordered lemon juice:
\[
\text{Number of members who ordered lemon juice} = \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12
\]

This means that \(30 - 12 = 18\) members did not order lemon juice.

Next, one-third of the remaining 18 members ordered mango juice:
\[
\text{Number of members who ordered mango juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

This leaves us with the rest of the members who ordered orange juice:
\[
\text{Number of members who ordered orange juice} = 18 - 6 = 12
\]

Thus, the number of members who ordered orange juice is:
\[
12
\]

Let's calculate step by step:

1. Two-fifths ordered lemon juice: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12 \)
2. Remaining members after order lemon juice: \( 30 - 12 = 18 \)
3. One-third of remaining members ordered mango juice: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \)
4. Members remaining after lemon and mango drinks: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)

So, 12 members ordered orange juice.

Let's go through the reasoning step by step to find out how many members ordered orange juice.

1. **Calculate the number of members who ordered lemon juice:**
   - \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 30 members ordered lemon juice.
   - \( \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12 \) members ordered lemon juice.
   - This means \( 30 - 12 = 18 \) members did not order lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the number of members who ordered mango juice:**
   - One-third of the remaining 18 members ordered mango juice.
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) members ordered mango juice.
   - This means \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) members did not order mango juice.

3. **Calculate the number of members who ordered orange juice:**
   - The rest of the members ordered orange juice.
   - \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) members ordered orange juice.

So, the number of members who ordered orange juice is 12.

To find out how many members ordered orange juice, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of members who ordered lemon juice.
2. Determine the number of remaining members after those who ordered lemon juice have been subtracted.
3. Find out how many of these remaining members ordered mango juice.
4. Subtract the number of members who ordered lemon juice and mango juice from the total number of members to find those who ordered orange juice.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Two-fifths of the members ordered lemon juice:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12 \]

So, 12 members ordered lemon juice.

2. The remaining members after those who ordered lemon juice are subtracted:
\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \]

Therefore, 18 members remained to be classified.

3. One-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, 6 members ordered mango juice.

4. The rest of the remaining members ordered orange juice:
\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, 12 members ordered orange juice.

To determine how many members ordered orange juice, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of members who ordered lemon juice.
2. Determine the number of members who did not order lemon juice.
3. Calculate the number of members who ordered mango juice.
4. Determine the number of members who ordered orange juice.

Let's start with the number of members who ordered lemon juice. Two-fifths of the 30 members ordered lemon juice:
\[
\text{Number of members who ordered lemon juice} = \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12
\]

Next, we find out how many members did not order lemon juice:
\[
\text{Number of members who did not order lemon juice} = 30 - 12 = 18
\]

One-third of the remaining members (18) ordered mango juice:
\[
\text{Number of members who ordered mango juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

The rest of the members ordered orange juice. To find the number of members who ordered orange juice, we subtract the number of members who ordered mango juice from the number of members who did not order lemon juice:
\[
\text{Number of members who ordered orange juice} = 18 - 6 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of members who ordered orange juice is \(\boxed{12}\).

To determine how many members ordered orange juice, we start by calculating the number of members who ordered lemon juice. The club has 30 members, and two-fifths of them ordered lemon juice:

\[
\text{Number of members who ordered lemon juice} = \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12

Next, we find the number of members who did not order lemon juice. This is the total number of members minus those who ordered lemon juice:

\[
\text{Number of members who did not order lemon juice} = 30 - 12 = 18
\]

One-third of the remaining members (those who did not order lemon juice) ordered mango juice:

\[
\text{Number of members who ordered mango juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6

To find out how many members ordered orange juice, it's helpful to first determine how many ordered lemon juice and then calculate the rest.

Total number of members = 30
Number of members ordering **lemon juice** = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12\)

Remaining members after ordering lemon juice:
\(30 - 12 = 18\)

Number of members ordering **mango juice**:
\(18 \times \frac{1}{3} = 6\)

The rest ordered **orange juice**:
\(18 - 6 = 12\)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, find out how many members ordered lemon juice. Since two-fifths of the 30 members ordered lemon juice, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 members ordered lemon juice.

2. Next, we subtract the lemon juice drinkers from the total to find out how many members are left:
   \[
   30 - 12 = 18
   \]
   So, there are 18 members left after those 12 ordered lemon juice.

3. Now, we find out how many of these 18 members ordered mango juice. Since one-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]
   So, 6 members ordered mango juice.

4. Finally, we subtract the mango juice drinkers from the 18 members to find out how many ordered orange juice:
   \[
   18 - 6 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 members ordered orange juice.

Therefore, 12 members ordered orange juice.

To find out how many members ordered orange juice, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the number of members who ordered lemon juice. Two-fifths of the 30 members ordered lemon juice.
\[ \text{Members who ordered lemon juice} = \frac{2}{5} \times 30 \]

2. Subtract the number of members who ordered lemon juice from the total to get the number of members who remained to be categorized.
\[ \text{Remaining members} = 30 - \text{Members who ordered lemon juice} \]

3. One-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice. So, calculate the number of members who ordered mango juice.
\[ \text{Members who ordered mango juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Remaining members} \]

4. Subtract the number of members who ordered mango juice from the remaining members to find out how many ordered orange juice.
\[ \text{Members who ordered orange juice} = \text{Remaining members} - \text{Members who ordered mango juice} \]

Performing the calculations:
\[ \text{Members who ordered lemon juice} = \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12 \]
\[ \text{Remaining members} = 30 - 12 = 18 \]
\[ \text{Members who ordered mango juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]
