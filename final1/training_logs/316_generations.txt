system
To find the new price after an increase of 15%, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate 15% of the original price. To do this, we multiply 15% by $220.
2. Then, we add this increase to the original price to find the new price.

For 15% of $220:
\[ \text{Increase} = 220 \times \frac{15}{100} = 220 \times 0.15 = 33 \]

Adding this increase to the original price:
\[ \text{New Price} = 220 + 33 = 253 \]

Therefore, the new price is $253.

To determine the new price of the bicycle, we need to calculate the increase in price and then add it to the original price.

Step 1: Calculate the increase in price.
The increase is 15% of the original price, which is 15% of $220.
\[ \text{Increase} = 15\% \times 220 = \frac{15}{100} \times 220 = 33 \]

Step 2: Add the increase to the original price.
\[ \text{New Price} = 220 + 33 = 253 \]

Therefore, the new price of the bicycle is $253.

To calculate the new price after a 15% increase, we first find the increase in price by multiplying the original price by 15%. Then we add this amount to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Percentage Increase} \]
\[ \text{Increase} = \$220 \times 15\% = \$220 \times 0.15 = \$33 \]

\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + \text{Increase} \]
\[ \text{New Price} = \$220 + \$33 = \$253 \]

To calculate the new price, you should first find out how much more the price increased by. You did this by multiplying last year's price by 15%.

New price = $220 + ($220 * 0.15)

New price = $220 + $33

New price = $253

So, the new price of the bicycle is $253.

To calculate the new price, you multiply the original price by the percentage increase.

First, convert the percentage to a decimal: 15% = 0.15

Then multiply the original price by the decimal: $220 * 0.15 = $33

Finally, add the increase to the original price to get the new price: $220 + $33 = $253
