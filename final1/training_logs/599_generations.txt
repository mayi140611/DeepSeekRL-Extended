###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Mike can type 65 words per minute. Due to a minor accident, Mike cannot use his right hand for a while so that his typing speed is now 20 words less per minute. If he is supposed to type a document with 810 words, how many minutes will it take him to finish typing the document?

#### ANS ####

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Since the issue is with his right hand, his new typing speed is 65 - 20 = 45 words per minute.
The time required to type 810 words with the new typing speed is given by the formula:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{words per minute}} \]
Hence, \( \text{time} = \frac{810}{45} = 18 \) minutes.

Mike's original typing speed is 65 words per minute. Due to the accident, his typing speed decreased to \( 65 - 20 = 45 \) words per minute. 

The document has 810 words in total. To find out how many minutes it will take for Mike to type the entire document, we divide the total number of words by his new typing speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New typing speed}} = \frac{810}{45} = 18 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Mike 18 minutes to finish typing the document.

To determine how many minutes it will take Mike to type an 810-word document with his reduced typing speed, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the reduced typing speed:**
   Mike's original typing speed is 65 words per minute. Due to the accident, his typing speed decreases by 20 words per minute.
   \[
   \text{Reduced typing speed} = 65 - 20 = 45 \text{ words per minute}
   \]

2. **Determine the total time required to type 810 words:**
   To find out how many minutes it will take Mike to type 810 words at his reduced speed of 45 words per minute, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total number of words}}{\text{Typing speed}}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{810}{45}
   \]

3. **Simplify the division:**
   \[
   \frac{810}{45} = 18
   \]

Therefore, it will take Mike 18 minutes to finish typing the document.

First, calculate Mike's original typing speed: 65 words per minute. With the accident, his typing speed is reduced by 20 words per minute, so his new typing speed becomes: 65 - 20 = 45 words per minute.

Next, determine how many minutes it would take him to type a 810-word document at his new typing speed. We use the formula:

\[
\text{time} = \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{words per minute}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{time} = \frac{810}{45}
\]

\[
\text{time} = 18
\]

Therefore, it will take Mike 18 minutes to finish typing the document.

To determine how many minutes it will take Mike to finish typing the document, we need to consider the difference in his typing speed due to the accident and then calculate the time required to type 810 words.

First, we find Mike's new typing speed after the accident:
\[ \text{New typing speed} = 65 - 20 = 45 \text{ words per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time it will take him to type 810 words at the new speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New typing speed}} = \frac{810}{45} = 18 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Mike 18 minutes to finish typing the document.

Mike's initial typing speed is 65 words per minute. After the accident, his typing speed is reduced by 20 words per minute, so his new typing speed is \( 65 - 20 = 45 \) words per minute.

To find out how many minutes it will take Mike to finish typing the 810-word document, we first need to determine his current typing speed without using his right hand. Originally, Mike can type 65 words per minute.

However, due to the accident, his speed is now reduced by 20 words per minute. So, his new typing speed is:

\[ 65 \text{ words/minute} - 20 \text{ words/minute} = 45 \text{ words/minute} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it will take Mike to type the entire document at his reduced speed. The document contains 810 words, and with his reduced speed of 45 words per minute, we can determine the time needed by dividing the total word count by his new typing speed:

\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New typing speed}} = \frac{810 \text{ words}}{45 \text{ words/minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = 18 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Mike 18 minutes to finish typing the document.

To find out how long it will take Mike to finish typing the document, we need to first determine his new typing speed after the accident.

Before the accident, Mike's typing speed was 65 words per minute. After the accident, his speed is reduced by 20 words per minute, so his new typing speed is:
\[ 65 - 20 = 45 \text{ words per minute} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to type 810 words at his new typing speed. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his new typing speed:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{810 \text{ words}}{45 \text{ words per minute}} = 18 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Mike 18 minutes to finish typing the document.

To determine how long it will take Mike to type 810 words, we first need to figure out his reduced typing speed after the accident. Originally, Mike can type 65 words per minute.

Since he cannot use his right hand, his typing speed is reduced by 20 words per minute. Therefore, his new typing speed is:

\[ 65 \, \text{words per minute} - 20 \, \text{words per minute} = 45 \, \text{words per minute} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it will take for Mike to type 810 words at his reduced speed. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his new typing speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{810 \, \text{words}}{45 \, \text{words per minute}} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{810}{45} = 18 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it will take Mike 18 minutes to finish typing the document.
