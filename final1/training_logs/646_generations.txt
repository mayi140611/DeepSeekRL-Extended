###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

system
Josh gave his 3 siblings a total of \(3 \times 10 = 30\) candies. This means he had \(100 - 30 = 70\) candies left. He then gave half of the remaining candies to his best friend, so he gave away \(70 / 2 = 35\) candies. This leaves him with \(70 - 35 = 35\) candies. If he only wants to eat 16 candies, then he has \(35 - 16 = 19\) candies left to be shared with others.

First, Josh gave his 3 siblings 10 candies each. That's a total of \(3 \times 10 = 30\) candies given away.

After giving these candies, he had \(100 - 30 = 70\) candies left.

Then he gave half of the remaining candies to his best friend. That means he gave away \(70 / 2 = 35\) candies.

After giving these candies to his best friend, he had \(70 - 35 = 35\) candies left.

Josh wants to eat 16 candies, so the number of candies left to be shared is \(35 - 16 = 19\).

Reasoning:

1. Josh starts with 100 gummy bear candies.
2. He gives 10 candies to each of his 3 siblings, so he gives away 3 * 10 = 30 candies. Now he has 100 - 30 = 70 candies left.
3. He then gives half of the remaining candies to his best friend, so he gives away 0.5 * 70 = 35 candies. Now he has 70 - 35 = 35 candies left.
4. Josh wants to eat 16 candies. So, he gives away 16 candies from the remaining 35, leaving him with 35 - 16 = 19 candies.

Therefore, there is 19 candies left to be shared with others.
