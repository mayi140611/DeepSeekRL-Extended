640
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we can calculate the number of pies eaten with forks and subtract it from the total number of pies.

68% of 2000 pies = 0.68 * 2000 = 1360 pies

Now, subtract the number of pies eaten with forks from the total number of pies:

2000 pies - 1360 pies = 640 pies

So, 640 pies are not eaten with forks.

Therefore, the answer is 640.

We need to find out how many pies are not eaten with forks. Since 68% of the pies are eaten with forks, then 100% - 68% = 32% of the pies are not eaten with forks. We can calculate 32% of 2000 pies.

$$ \text{Pies not eaten with forks} = \left( \frac{32}{100} \right) \times 2000 $$

To find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we first need to calculate 68% of the total number of pies, which is 2000.

68% of 2000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 68\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{68}{100} \times 2000 = 0.68 \times 2000 = 1360 \]

So, 1360 pies are eaten with forks.

Now, to find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we subtract the number of pies eaten with forks from the total number of pies:
\[ 2000 - 1360 = 640 \]

Therefore, 640 pies are not eaten with forks.

To find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we can calculate 68% of the total number of pies and subtract it from 100%. 

68% of 2000 pie is calculated as \( \frac{68}{100} \times 2000 = 1360 \).

So, the number of pies not eaten with forks is \( 2000 - 1360 = 640 \).

To find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we first need to calculate the total number of pies eaten with forks and then subtract that from the total number of pies.

1. Calculate the number of pies eaten with forks:
\[ 68\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.68 \times 2000 = 1360 \]

2. Subtract the number of pies eaten with forks from the total number of pies to find those not eaten with forks:
\[ 2000 - 1360 = 640 \]

So, 640 pies are not eaten with forks.

To find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we can calculate 68% of 2000 pies since 68% of all pies are eaten with forks.

Number of pies eaten with forks = 68% of 2000 pies = (68/100) * 2000 = 1360 pies

So, the number of pies not eaten with forks would be:

Total pies - Pies eaten with forks = 2000 pies - 1360 pies = 640 pies

Therefore, 640 pies are not eaten with forks.

To find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we first need to determine how many pies are eaten with forks. This can be calculated by finding 68% of the total number of pies.

68% of 2000 pies = \( \frac{68}{100} \times 2000 \)

\( = 0.68 \times 2000 \)

\( = 1360 \)

Therefore, 1360 pies are eaten with forks.

Now, to find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we subtract the number of pies eaten with forks from the total number of pies.

Total number of pies - number of pies eaten with forks = number of pies not eaten with forks

\( = 2000 - 1360 \)

\( = 640 \)

So, 640 pies are not eaten with forks.

Given that 68% of all pies are eaten with forks, this means 100% - 68% = 32% of all pies are not eaten with forks. 

To find the number of pies not eaten with forks out of 2000 pies:
\[ \text{Number of pies not eaten with forks} = \frac{32}{100} \times 2000 \]

To find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we first need to find out how many pies are eaten with forks. We do this by multiplying the percentage of pies eaten with forks by the total number of pies:

\( \text{Pies eaten with forks} = \frac{68}{100} \times 2000 \)

\( \text{Pies eaten with forks} = 0.68 \times 2000 \)

\( \text{Pies eaten with forks} = 1360 \)

Now, to find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we subtract the number of pies eaten with forks from the total number of pies:

\( \text{Pies not eaten with forks} = 2000 - 1360 \)

\( \text{Pies not eaten with forks} = 640 \)

So, 640 pies are not eaten with forks.

To find out how many pies are not eaten with forks, we can calculate 100% (all pies) minus the percentage of pies eaten with forks.

68% of all pies are eaten with forks, so to find the percentage of pies not eaten with forks:

100% - 68% = 32%

Now, we can calculate the number of pies not eaten with forks by multiplying the total number of pies by the percentage of pies not eaten with forks:

2000 pies * 32% = 2000 pies * 0.32 = 640 pies

So, 640 of the pies are not eaten with forks.

The total number of pies is given as 2000. According to the given percentage, \(68\%\) of the pies are eaten with forks. 

So, to find the number of pies eaten with forks, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of pies eaten with forks} = 68\% \times 2000 \]
\[ = \frac{68}{100} \times 2000 \]
\[ = 0.68 \times 2000 \]
\[ = 1360 \]

There are 2000 pies total, and 1360 of them are eaten with forks. Therefore, the number of pies not eaten with forks can be calculated by subtracting the number of pies eaten with forks from the total number of pies:
\[ \text{Number of pies not eaten with forks} = \text{Total number of pies} - \text{Number of pies eaten with forks} \]
\[ = 2000 - 1360 \]
\[ = 640 \]

So, the number of pies not eaten with forks is \(640\).
