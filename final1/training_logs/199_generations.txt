###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Gary bought his first used car for $6,000.  Gary borrowed the money from his dad who said he could pay him back the full amount over 5 years.  Gary decided he would pay his dad back the full amount in 2 years.  How much more is Gary spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5?

The total amount of the loan that Gary owes is $6,000. Since he wants to pay it off in 2 years instead of 5, he will need to pay it back in 2/5 of the original 5-year term. In two years, he will need to pay off the loan over 2/5 * 5 years = 5 years.
To determine how much per month Gary will need to pay, first calculate the total monthly payments if he makes them over a 5-year term: $6,000 / 60 months = $100/mo. To find out how much more he will need to pay for the loan over 2 years and not 5, calculate the difference between the total amount that a 5-year-loan would bring to $6,000 and a 2-year-loan brings: $6,000 - $6,000 = $0 and then subtract the monthly amount of $100/mo * 24 months = $2,400. 
2,400 - 100 = 2300

Gary borrowed $6,000 and promised to pay it back over 5 years. He decides to pay it off in 2 years instead. 

First, let's calculate how much he needs to pay per year if he repays over 5 years. 

\[ \text{Total amount} = \$6,000 \]
\[ \text{Number of months in 5 years} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$6,000}{60} = \$100 \]

Now, let's calculate the monthly payment if he repays in 2 years:
\[ \text{Number of months in 2 years} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]
\[ \text{New monthly payment} = \frac{\$6,000}{24} = \$250 \]

Finally, let's calculate the difference in the amount Gary needs to pay per month:
\[ \text{Difference in monthly payment} = \$250 - \$100 = \$150 \]

First, calculate the monthly payments for the 5-year loan.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

$6,000 / 60 months = $100 per month

Then, calculate the monthly payments for the 2-year loan.

2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months

$6,000 / 24 months = $250 per month

Now, subtract the lower amount from the higher amount to find the difference.

$250 - $100 = $150

Gary is spending $150 more per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5 years.

The total amount he borrowed was $6,000.  He initially planned to pay this in 5 years, which is 60 months.  If he is paying instead over 2 years, he is paying it off in 24 months.  He is splitting the loan into 1/3 of its value each month because he is paying it off faster.  6000/3=2000.  He is now paying 2000 per month because he is paying off the loan in 1/3 of the time.  6000-2000=4000.  He is paying 4000 more per month than he used to because he is paying the full amount back faster.

First, calculate the total amount that Gary will owe his dad if he pays back the loan in 5 years. This is simply the initial amount he borrowed, which is $6,000.

To find out how much Gary will owe his dad each month if he pays the loan off in 5 years, you divide the total amount by the number of months in 5 years:
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$6,000}{5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year}} = \$6,000 \div 60 = \$100 \]

For the 2-year scenario, calculate the total amount Gary will owe:
\[ \text{Total amount for 2 years} = \$6,000 \times 2 = \$12,000 \]

Now, find out how much Gary will owe per month in 2 years:
\[ \text{Monthly payment for 2 years} = \frac{\$12,000}{2 \times 12 \text{ months/year}} = \frac{\$12,000}{24} = \$500 \]

To find out how much more Gary is spending per month in the 2-year repayment period compared to the 5-year period, subtract the monthly payment for 5 years from the monthly payment for 2 years:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$500 - \$100 = \$400 \]

Gary bought his first used car for $6,000. He will repay $6,000 in 2 years with monthly payments. At $200/month, he will pay back the $6,000 in exactly 2 years.

If he had borrowed the money for 5 years, he would have paid it back in 25 months instead of 24, by $100 more per month.

His total monthly payment with 5 years would be $200 + $100 = $300.

$6,000 / 24 months = $250/month repayment for 5 years.
$6,000 / 25 months = $240/month repayment for 5 years.

Initially, Gary was supposed to pay back the full amount over 5 years. This means he was committing to paying each year $6,000 / 5 years = $1,200 per year.

Since he decided to pay the loan off in 2 years, he now has to pay $6,000 / 2 years = $3,000 towards his dad over 2 years.

To find out how much more Gary is spending per month, we subtract the original monthly payment from the new monthly payment and then divide this difference by 12 months.

$3,000 / 12 months = $250 per month.

First, we find the monthly payment: $6000 / 10 = $600 / month
Now we can multiple that by the amount of months they are paying over to find the total monthly payment: $600 * 24 = $14,400
Now we find the difference between the two total monthly payments: $14,400 - $6000 = $8,400

Gary initially paid $6,000 in 5 years. To pay it back in 2 years, he needs to pay back the principal plus interest on the remaining 3 years.

Interest from 5 years to 2 years = 6000 * 3 * 12 = 216,000

So now he owes his dad a total of 216,000

216,000 / 24 = 9000

9000 / 12 = 750

Gary is spending 750 more per month.

Gary borrowed the money at an interest rate of 10%.  That means the total interest he will end up owing is 6,000 * .1 * 2 = $1,200.  He will end up owing his dad 6,000 + 1,200 = $7,200.  He will have 2 * 12 = 24 months to pay back the loan.  7,200 / 24 = $300 per month.  He will have 5 * 12 = 60 months to pay back the loan at the full amount.  60 * 12 = $7200.  So he will be spending 7200 - 7200 = $0 more per month.

Gary will need to pay back $6,000 at an annual percentage rate (APR) of 12% over 2 years instead of 5 years. We can use the formula for the monthly payment on a loan, which is:

M = P * r * (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n – 1)

where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal loan amount ($6,000)
r = monthly interest rate (12% APR / 12 months = 1% or 0.01)
n = total number of payments (2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

M = $6,000 * 0.01 * (1 + 0.01)^24 / ((1 + 0.01)^24 – 1)

Calculating this, we find that Gary would need to make monthly payments of $380.48 to pay off the loan in 2 years. To find out how much more Gary is spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5 years, we can calculate the difference in monthly payments:

Increase in monthly payment = $380.48 – $218.23 = $162.25

Therefore, Gary is spending $162.25 more per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5 years.
</reasoning>
<answer>
380.48
</answer>
Gary's total payment over 5 years would be $(6,000 * 0.01 * (1 + 0.01)^6 / ((1+0.01)^6 - 1) = 3327.06 and over 2 years would be $(6,000 * 0.01 * (1 + 0.01)^4 / ((1+0.01)^4 - 1) = 1622.50. Thus, he is spending an additional $1622.50 per month.

Gary bought the car for $6,000 and borrowed the full amount from his dad. He decided to pay back the loan in 2 years instead of 5 years, which means he will pay back the loan in half the time.

To find out how much more Gary is spending per month, we need to calculate how much he would pay per month if he takes 2 years to repay the loan and how much he will pay per month if he takes 5 years to repay the loan.

Let's assume the monthly payment is the same regardless of how long it takes to repay the loan. We can use the formula for the monthly payment on a loan:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate}}{\text{Number of Payments per Year}} + \frac{\text{Principal}}{\text{Number of Payments per Year}} \]

Since we don't have the annual interest rate, let's assume a 0% interest rate for simplicity, as this simplifies the calculation without affecting the difference in monthly payments significantly.

If Gary takes 2 years (24 months) to repay the loan:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{6000}{24} + \frac{6000}{24} = 250 + 250 = 500 \]

If Gary takes 5 years (60 months) to repay the loan:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{6000}{60} + \frac{6000}{60} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

The difference in monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 500 - 200 = 300 \]

Therefore, Gary is spending $300 more per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5 years.

Gary originally borrowed $6,000 at an annual interest rate, which simplifies to a monthly interest rate of 1.25%. If he borrowed the full price for 2 years, then he paid $6,000 * (1 + 0.0125)^4 = $6,249.75. To pay off the loan in 2 years, he will have to pay $6,249.75 - $6,000 = $249.75 per month. He has 3 years of extra repayment, so he pays a total of $3 * $249.75 = $749.25. He needs to spend $749.25 - $6000 = $259.25 per month.
