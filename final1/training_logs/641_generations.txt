Reasoning:

1. The block has 12 floors, with an equal number of floors having 6 apartments and 6 floors having 5 apartments.
2. Half of the 12 floors, which is 6 floors, each have 6 apartments. Therefore, there are \(6 \times 6 = 36\) apartments in this half.
3. The other half of the 12 floors, each with 5 apartments, contain \(6 \times 5 = 30\) apartments.
4. Adding up all the apartments across the entire block: \(36 + 30 = 66\) apartments.
5. Each apartment can accommodate a maximum of 4 residents.
6. Therefore, the maximum number of residents the block can accommodate is \(66 \times 4 = 264\).

To determine the maximum number of residents in the block of flats, we first need to calculate the total number of apartments in the block.

There are 12 floors in the block. Half of the floors have 6 apartments each, and the other half have 5 apartments each. Therefore, there are 6 floors with 6 apartments and 6 floors with 5 apartments.

The number of apartments is calculated as follows:
(6 floors * 6 apartments/floor) + (6 floors * 5 apartments/floor) = 36 + 30 = 66 apartments.

Each apartment can accommodate a maximum of 4 residents. Therefore, the total maximum number of residents is:
66 apartments * 4 residents/apartment = 264 residents.

Thus, the maximum number of residents that can live in this block of flats is 264.

To find the maximum number of residents that can live in the block of flats, we first need to determine the total number of apartments in the block. Since the block has 12 floors and half of the floors have 6 apartments and the other half have 5 apartments, we can calculate the number of apartments on each half:

\[ \text{Number of apartments on each half} = \frac{12 \text{ floors}}{2} = 6 \text{ floors} \]

On the floors with 6 apartments, the number of apartments is:
\[ 6 \text{ floors} \times 6 \text{ apartments per floor} = 36 \text{ apartments} \]

On the floors with 5 apartments, the number of apartments is:
\[ 6 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ apartments per floor} = 30 \text{ apartments} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of apartments:
\[ 36 \text{ apartments} + 30 \text{ apartments} = 66 \text{ apartments} \]

Since each apartment can accommodate a maximum of 4 residents, the maximum number of residents that can live in the block of flats is:
\[ 66 \text{ apartments} \times 4 \text{ residents per apartment} = 264 \text{ residents} \]

So, the maximum number of residents that can live in this block of flats is 264.

To find the maximum number of residents that can live in this block of flats, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and then multiply by the maximum number of residents per apartment.

First, let's find the number of floors with 6 apartments and the number with 5 apartments.
- There are 12 floors in total, so half of them have 6 apartments and the other half have 5 apartments.
- Number of floors with 6 apartments = \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
- Number of floors with 5 apartments = \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments.
- Total number of apartments = (6 apartments/floor) * 6 floors + (5 apartments/floor) * 6 floors
- Total number of apartments = \( 6 \times 6 + 5 \times 6 \)
- Total number of apartments = \( 36 + 30 = 66 \)

Now, we multiply the total number of apartments by the maximum number of residents per apartment.
- Maximum number of residents = \( 66 \times 4 \)
- Maximum number of residents = \( 264 \)

Therefore, the maximum number of residents that can live in this block of flats is **264**.

To determine the maximum number of residents that can live in the block of flats, we need to first calculate the total number of apartments and then multiply by the maximum number of residents per apartment.

1. **Calculate the number of floors with 6 apartments and the number with 5 apartments:**
   - There are 12 floors in total.
   - Half of the floors have 6 apartments, so that's \(12 / 2 = 6\) floors.
   - The other half have 5 apartments, also \(12 / 2 = 6\) floors.

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - Number of apartments on the floors with 6 apartments = \(6 \times 6\)
   - Number of apartments on the floors with 5 apartments = \(6 \times 5\)
   - Total number of apartments = \((6 \times 6) + (6 \times 5)\)

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \(6 \times 6 = 36\)
   - \(6 \times 5 = 30\)

4. **Add the totals to find the overall number of apartments:**
   - Total number of apartments = 36 + 30 = 66

5. **Calculate the maximum number of residents:**
   - Each apartment can accommodate a maximum of 4 residents.
   - Maximum number of residents = \(66 \times 4\)

6. **Perform the final multiplication:**
   - \(66 \times 4 = 264\)

So, the maximum number of residents that can live in the block of flats is 264.

To determine the maximum number of residents that can live in the block of flats, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of floors with 6 apartments.
2. Calculate the number of floors with 5 apartments.
3. Compute the total number of apartments.
4. Multiply the total number of apartments by the maximum occupancy per apartment.

From the problem:

- There are 12 floors in total.
- Half of the floors have 6 apartments, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 floors with 6 apartments each.
- The other half of the floors have 5 apartments, so there are also 12 / 2 = 6 floors with 5 apartments each.

Let's compute in detail:

Total number of apartments = [Floors with 6 apartments] * [Number of apartments per floor with 6 apartments]
                         + [Floors with 5 apartments] * [Number of apartments per floor with 5 apartments]
= 6 * 6 + 6 * 5
= 6 * (6 + 5) 
= 6 * 11 
= 66

Now, we calculate the maximum number of residents:

Maximum residents = Total number of apartments * Maximum number of residents per apartment
                 = 66 * 4
                 = 264

Thus, the maximum number of residents that can live in the block of flats is 264.

Reasoning:

1. Half of the floors have 6 apartments: Half of 12 floors is 12 / 2 = 6 floors.
2. The other half have 5 apartments: The remaining 6 floors.
3. Half of 6 floors are 6 / 2 = 3 floors with 6 apartments.
4. The other half are 6 floors with 5 apartments each.

Now, calculate the total number of apartments:
- 3 floors with 6 apartments: 3 floors * 6 apartments/floor = 18 apartments.
- 6 floors with 5 apartments: 6 floors * 5 apartments/floor = 30 apartments.

Total number of apartments: 18 + 30 = 48 apartments.

Each apartment maximum accommodates 4 residents, thus:

The block of flats has 12 floors, divided into two equal halves, meaning there are 6 floors with 6 apartments each and 6 floors with 5 apartments each. 
To calculate the total number of residents, we need to sum the maximum number of residents in each set of apartments first.
For the 6 floors with 6 apartments each, the total number of apartments is 6*6 = 36. With 4 residents per apartment, the total number of residents is 36*4 = 144.
Similarly, for the 6 floors with 5 apartments, the total number of apartments is 6*5 = 30. With 4 residents per apartment, the total number of residents is 30*4 = 120.
To find the total maximum number of residents, we add the two totals together: 144+120 = 264.

To determine the maximum number of residents that can live in the block of flats, we need to consider that half of the floors have 6 apartments and the other half have 5 apartments. 

1. Half of the floors have 6 apartments, so there are 12/2 = 6 floors with 6 apartments each.
   - Number of apartments in these floors = 6 floors * 6 apartments/floor = 36 apartments.

2. The other half of the floors have 5 apartments, so there are also 12/2 = 6 floors with 5 apartments each.

Each floor has either 6 apartments or 5 apartments. Since half of the floors have 6 apartments and the other half have 5 apartments, we can calculate the total number of apartments in the block as follows:

Total floors = 12
Floors with 6 apartments = 12 / 2 = 6
Floors with 5 apartments = 12 / 2 = 6

Total apartments = (Floors with 6 apartments * 6) + (Floors with 5 apartments * 5)
Total apartments = (6 * 6) + (6 * 5)
Total apartments = 36 + 30
Total apartments = 66

Each apartment can accommodate a maximum of 4 residents, so we can calculate the maximum number of residents that can live in the block as follows:

Maximum residents = Total apartments * 4
Maximum residents = 66 * 4
Maximum residents = 264
