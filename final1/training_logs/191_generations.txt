The foxes catch \(3 \times 4 = 12\) weasels per week. After 3 weeks, the foxes will have caught \(12 \times 3 = 36\) weasels. The number of weasels left after 3 weeks will be \(100 - 36 = 64\).

The foxes catch \(3 \times 2 = 6\) rabbits per week. After 3 weeks, the foxes will have caught \(6 \times 3 = 18\) rabbits. The number of rabbits left after 3 weeks will be \(50 - 18 = 32\).

After 3 weeks, each fox catches 4 x 3 = 12 weasels.
So, after 3 weeks, a total of 100 x 12 = 1200 weasels will be caught.
Therefore, 1200 - 100 = 1100 weasels will be left after 3 weeks.
After 3 weeks, each fox catches 2 x 3 = 6 rabbits.
So, after 3 weeks, a total of 50 x 6 = 300 rabbits will be caught.
Therefore, 300 - 50 = 250 rabbits will be left after 3 weeks.

Each week, the three foxes catch 3 * 4 = 12 weasels.
After one week, the 100 weasels left after the foxes eat 100 - 12 = 88 weasels left.
Each week, the three foxes catch 3 * 2 = 6 rabbits.
After one week, the 50 rabbits left after the foxes eat 50 - 6 = 44 rabbits left.
After 3 weeks, there are 88 + 44 = 132 rodents left.

Each fox catches 4 x 3 = 12 weasels in 3 weeks.
So, 100 - 12 = 88 weasels are left after 3 weeks.
Each fox catches 2 x 3 = 6 rabbits in 3 weeks.
Thus, 50 - 6 x 3 = 30 rabbits will be left after 3 weeks.
Therefore, the answer is 88 weasels and 30 rabbits.

There are initially 100 weasels and 50 rabbits. Each fox catches an average of 4 weasels and 2 rabbits per week, so in 3 weeks, each fox will catch 4 * 3 = 12 weasels and 2 * 3 = 6 rabbits per week. Since there are 3 foxes, after 3 weeks, each fox will have caught a total of 12 + 6 = 18 weasels and rabbits per week. Therefore, in total, the foxes will have caught 18 * 3 = 54 weasels and rabbits per week. So, after 3 weeks, there will be 100 - 54 = 46 weasels left. And there will be 50 - 54 = -4 rabbits left. Since there can't be a negative number of rabbits, this means that the foxes will have caught all the rabbits before the third week and will have finished eating the weasels by the end of the third week. <answer>

To determine how many weasels and rabbits will be left after 3 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of weasels and rabbits each fox catches in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks (3).

First, we calculate the total number of weasels caught by all three foxes in one week:
- Each fox catches 4 weasels per week.
- There are 3 foxes.
- Therefore, the total number of weasels caught in one week is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

Next, we calculate the total number of rabbits caught by all three foxes in one week:
- Each fox catches 2 rabbits per week.
- There are 3 foxes.
- Therefore, the total number of rabbits caught in one week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Now, we calculate the total number of weasels and rabbits caught by all three foxes over 3 weeks:
- The total number of weasels caught in 3 weeks is \(12 \times 3 = 36\).
- The total number of rabbits caught in 3 weeks is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

Finally, we subtract the total number of weasels and rabbits caught by the foxes from the original number of weasels and rabbits to find out how many are left.
- The number of weasels left is \(100 - 36 = 64\).
- The number of rabbits left is \(50 - 18 = 32\).

So, after 3 weeks, the number of weasels left is 64 and the number of rabbits left is 32.

Initially, there are 100 weasels and 50 rabbits.

The foxes each catch 4 weasels and 2 rabbits per week. So in one week, each fox will catch an additional:
4 weasels + 2 rabbits = 6 animals per fox.

With 3 foxes, in one week, they will catch an additional:
3 foxes × 6 animals = 18 animals.

In three weeks, they will catch an additional:
3 weeks × 18 animals = 54 animals.

So after 3 weeks, the number of weasels left will be:
100 weasels - 54 weasels = 46 weasels.

And the number of rabbits left will be:
50 rabbits - 54 rabbits = -4 rabbits.

However, it's not possible to have a negative number of rabbits. This means that the foxes will have hunted all the rabbits and they won't be hunting them again until their next catch. Therefore, there will be 0 rabbits left after 3 weeks.

After 3 weeks, each fox will catch 4 x 3 = 12 weasels. So, they will kill 3 x 12 = 36 weasels in 3 weeks.
They will also catch 2 x 3 = 6 rabbits in 3 weeks.

The foxes catch 400 weasels per week (3 foxes * 4 weasels/fox/week). After three weeks, there will be 100 weasels - 400 weasels/week * 3 weeks = -100 weasels. Weasels cannot have a negative number of individuals. The minimum of 0 needs to be reported. The foxes catch 300 rabbits per week (3 foxes * 2 rabbits/fox/week). After three weeks, there will be 50 rabbits - 300 rabbits/week * 3 weeks = -300 rabbits. The minimum of 0 needs to be reported.

Initially, there are 100 weasels and 50 rabbits in the forest. After 3 weeks, each fox catches:
- 4 weasels per fox per week, totaling \(4 \times 3 = 12\) weasels.
- 2 rabbits per fox per week, totaling \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rabbits.

For the foxes to continue hunting, we need \(3 \times 12 = 36\) weasels and \(3 \times 6 = 18\) rabbits.

Total foxes catch 54 weasels and 30 rabbits.

Therefore, the number of weasels left is:
\[100 - 54 = 46\]

And the number of rabbits left is:
\[50 - 30 = 20\]

The final answer is \(46\) weasels and \(20\) rabbits.
