Initially, the truck contains:
- 26 pink hard hats
- 15 green hard hats
- 24 yellow hard hats

Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, leaving:
\[ 26 - 4 = 22 \]

John takes away 6 pink hard hats, which is twice the number of pink hard hats Carl took (since he took 4, John takes \(2 \times 4 = 6\)). Therefore, John takes away 6 pink hard hats from the remaining 22, leaving:
\[ 22 - 6 = 16 \]

John also takes away twice as many green hard hats as the number he took from the pink ones. John took 6 pink hard hats, so he takes:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \] green hard hats.

John leaves behind:
\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \] yellow hard hats.

Therefore, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is:
\[ 16 (pink) + 12 (green) + 12 (yellow) = 40 \]

So, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is \(\boxed{40}\).

To determine the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck, we need to account for the hard hats taken away by Carl and John, as well as the original quantities.

1. **Initial quantities:**
   - Pink hard hats: 26
   - Green hard hats: 15
   - Yellow hard hats: 24

2. **Carl's action:**
   - Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats.
   - Carl also takes away twice as many green hard hats as the pink ones he took.
     - Number of green hard hats taken away by Carl: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
   - Remaining pink hard hats: \(26 - 4 = 22\)
   - Remaining green hard hats: \(15 - 8 = 7\)
   - Yellow hard hats remain unchanged: 24

3. **John's action:**
   - John takes away 6 pink hard hats.
   - John takes away twice as many green hard hats as the pink ones he took.
     - Number of green hard hats taken away by John: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
   - Remaining pink hard hats: \(22 - 6 = 16\)
   - Remaining green hard hats: \(7 - 12 = -5\)
     - Since John cannot take away more green hard hats than are available, it means John takes a negative number of green hats, and there will be an excess of 5 pink hard hats over the green ones subtracted.

4. **Total remaining hard hats:**
   - Total pink hard hats: 16
   - Total green hard hats: -5 (excess over given)
   - Total yellow hard hats: 24

   Therefore, the total number of hard hats remaining is:
   \[
   16 + 24 + 24 = 64
   \]

**Conclusion:**
The total number of hard hats remaining in the truck is \(\boxed{64}\).

Reasoning:

First, we determine how many pink hard hats remain after Carl takes 4 pink hard hats away. We subtract 4 from the initial 26 pink hard hats:

\[ 26 - 4 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the number of green hard hats taken by John. John took 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed, which is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

We then subtract the green hard hats taken by John from the initial 15 green hard hats:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Now, we add up the remaining hard hats by adding the number of pink hard hats, green hard hats, and yellow hard hats:

\[ 22 (pink) + 3 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 49 \]

Therefore, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is 49.

Answer:

The total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is 49.

Reasoning:
First, let's determine the initial number of hard hats for each color:
- Pink: 26
- Green: 15
- Yellow: 24

Next, we'll calculate the number of hard hats removed by Carl and John:

Carl removes 4 pink hard hats.
John removes 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. Therefore, John removes \(2 \times 6 = 12\) green hard hats.

Now, let's calculate how many hard hats of each color remain in the truck:

Pink hard hats remaining: \(26 - 4 - 6 = 16\)
Green hard hats remaining: \(15 - 12 = 3\)
Yellow hard hats remain unchanged: 24

Finally, let's calculate the total number of hard hats remaining:

Pink hard hats: 16
Green hard hats: 3
Yellow hard hats: 24

Total remaining hard hats: \(16 + 3 + 24 = 43\)

Answer:
The total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is 43.

To calculate the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hard hats initially:**
   - Pink hard hats: 26
   - Green hard hats: 15
   - Yellow hard hats: 24

   Total number of hard hats = 26 (pink) + 15 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 65 

2. **Determine how many hard hats were removed:**
   - Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats.
   - John takes away 6 pink hard hats.
   - John takes twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed, which is \( 2 \times 6 = 12\) green hard hats.

   Total number of pink hard hats taken away = 4 (by Carl) + 6 (by John) = 10

   Total number of green hard hats taken away = 12

3. **Calculate the remaining number of each color of hard hats:**
   - Remaining pink hard hats: total pink hard hats - pink hard hats taken away = 26 - 10 = 16
   - Remaining green hard hats: total green hard hats - green hard hats taken away = 15 - 12 = 3
   - Remaining yellow hard hats: total yellow hard hats = 24 (none taken away)

4. **Calculate the total number of hard hats remaining:**
   - Total remaining hard hats = pink hard hats remaining + green hard hats remaining + yellow hard hats remaining
   - Total remaining hard hats = 16 (pink) + 3 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 43

Therefore, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is 43.

Initially, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats, making a total of 26 + 15 + 24 = 65 hard hats.

When Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, the number of pink hard hats remaining is 26 - 4 = 22 pink hard hats.

John takes away 6 pink hard hats, which is twice the number Carl took (6 = 2 * 3), leaving the number of pink hard hats as 22 - 6 = 16 pink hard hats.

During this process, 6 green hard hats are taken, which is twice the number of pink hard hats, so 6 = 2 * 3. The number of green hard hats remaining is 15 - 6 = 9 green hard hats.

All yellow hard hats remain, so the number of yellow hard hats remaining is 24.

Therefore, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is 16 (pink) + 9 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 49 hard hats.

Initially, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats in the truck.

Carl removes 4 pink hard hats, so the number of pink hard hats remaining is:
\[ 26 - 4 = 22 \]

John removes 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hats he removed, which means he removes \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) green hard hats.

So, the number of pink hard hats remaining is:

<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of hard hats taken away by Carl and John from the total number of hard hats in the truck.

1. Initially, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats in the truck. So the total number of hard hats in the truck initially is the sum of these three numbers:
   \[ 26 + 15 + 24 = 65 \]

2. Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, so the number of pink hard hats left in the truck is:
   \[ 26 - 4 = 22 \]

3. John takes away 6 pink hard hats, so the number of pink hard hats left in the truck is:
   \[ 22 - 6 = 16 \]

4. John also takes twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. Since John removed 6 pink hard hats, he takes away:
   \[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ green hard hats} \]

5. The number of green hard hats left in the truck is:
   \[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

6. The number of yellow hard hats remains unchanged, so it is still:
   \[ 24 \]

7. Now we add up the remaining hard hats to find the total:
   \[ 16 \text{ pink hard hats} + 3 \text{ green hard hats} + 24 \text{ yellow hard hats} = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of hard hats left in the truck is 43.

Reasoning:
First, we need to calculate the total number of hard hats initially in the truck:
26 (pink) + 15 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 65 hard hats

Next, we account for the number of hard hats removed by Carl:
4 (pink) + 6 (green) = 10 hard hats

Now, we need to calculate the number of hard hats John took away:
Twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed: 
2 * 4 (pink) = 8 green hard hats

Finally, we calculate the number of hard hats remaining in the truck:
65 (initial number of hard hats) - 10 (hard hats removed by Carl) - 8 (hard hats removed by John) = 47 hard hats

Therefore, the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck is 47.

Reasoning:
Initially, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats, totaling 65 hard hats in the truck.

Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, leaving 26 - 4 = 22 pink hard hats.

John takes away 6 pink hard hats, adding 6 to the 22 remaining, thus making 22 + 6 = 28 pink hard hats.

John also takes twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed, which is 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats.

So, the total number of green hard hats left are 15 - 12 = 3 green hard hats, plus the 6 pink hard hats taken away, totaling 3 + 6 = 9 green hard hats.

John also takes twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed, which is 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats.

So, the total number of green hard hats left are 24 - 12 = 12 green hard hats, plus the 6 pink hard hats taken away, totaling 12 + 6 = 18 green hard hats.

Adding up the remaining pink and green hard hats and the yellow hard hats, the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck is 28 (pink) + 6 (taken away) + 9 (green) + 18 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 77 hard hats.
