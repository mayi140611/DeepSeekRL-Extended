system
Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance as \( A \).

According to the problem:
1. Fred spent half of his allowance on movies, so he spent \( \frac{A}{2} \).
2. He then earned an additional 6 dollars by washing the family car.
3. After these transactions, he ended up with 14 dollars.

We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:
\[ \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):

1. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{A}{2} = 14 - 6 \]
\[ \frac{A}{2} = 8 \]

2. Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 8 \times 2 \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Fred's weekly allowance is \( 16 \) dollars.

Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance by \( A \).

According to the problem, Fred spent half of his allowance on movies, so he spent \( \frac{A}{2} \).
After spending, he earned an additional $6 by washing the car, and ended up with $14.
We can set up the following equation to represent his situation:
\[ \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]
To find \( A \), we first solve the equation:
\[ \frac{A}{2} = 14 - 6 \]
\[ \frac{A}{2} = 8 \]
\[ A = 8 \times 2 \]
\[ A = 16 \]

Therefore, Fred's weekly allowance is $16.

<reasoning>
Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance as \( A \). According to the problem, Fred spent half of his allowance on movies, so he spent \( \frac{1}{2}A \). After spending, he earned $6 by washing the car, and ended up with $14. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}A - 6 = 14 \]

This equation represents the total amount Fred had after washing the car plus any leftover from going to the movies.

To solve for \( A \), we first add 6 to both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}A - 6 + 6 = 14 + 6 \]

Simplify the left side:

\[ \frac{1}{2}A = 20 \]

Now, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 20 \times 2 \]

\[ A = 40 \]

So, Fred's weekly allowance is $40.

system
Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance by \( A \).

According to the problem, Fred spent half of his allowance going to the movies. This means he spent \( \frac{A}{2} \).

After spending this amount, he had half of his allowance left. So he had \( \frac{A}{2} \) dollars left.

Then, he washed the family car and earned 6 dollars. Adding this to the money he had left, he ended up with 14 dollars. So we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{A}{2} - \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6 = 14 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{A}{2} = 8 \]

Now, we can solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 8 \times 2 = 16 \]

So, Fred's weekly allowance is 16 dollars.

Let's reason through this step by step:

1. Fred ended up with $14 after washing the family car and earning $6.
2. This means he had $14 - $6 = $8 before earning the $6.
3. After earning the $6, he spent half of his allowance on movies, which means the $8 is half of his allowance.
4. Therefore, his entire allowance is twice the $8, which is $8 * 2 = $16.

So, Fred's weekly allowance is $16.

system
Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance by \( A \).

According to the problem, Fred spent half of his allowance on movies, so he spent \( \frac{A}{2} \) dollars.
He also earned 6 dollars from washing the car.

After these transactions, Fred ended up with 14 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A - \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]

To solve this equation step-by-step:
1. Combine like terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{A}{2} + 6 \]
2. Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( A \):
\[ \frac{A}{2} \]
3. Subtract 6 from both sides again to isolate the constant term on the left:
\[ A = 8 \]

So, Fred's weekly allowance is \( 8 \) dollars.

Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance as \( A \).

According to the problem, Fred spent half of his allowance on movies, which means he spent \( \frac{A}{2} \) dollars. After spending this amount, he earned 6 dollars by washing the family car. The problem states that after these transactions, Fred had 14 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A - \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]

To solve this equation, let's first simplify the left side:

\[ \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]

Now, we subtract 6 from both sides to isolate \( \frac{A}{2} \):

\[ \frac{A}{2} = 14 - 6 \]
\[ \frac{A}{2} = 8 \]

To find \( A \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ A = 16 \]

So, Fred's weekly allowance is \( \boxed{16} \) dollars.

Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance as \( A \).

According to the problem, Fred spent half of his allowance on movies, so he spent \( \frac{A}{2} \).

After spending on movies, Fred had \( A - \frac{A}{2} = \frac{A}{2} \) left.

He also earned an additional $6 by washing the family car, so after earning this money, he had \( \frac{A}{2} + 6 \) dollars.

The problem states that after these transactions, Fred ended up with $14. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]

Let's solve this equation to find \( A \).

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

\[ \frac{A}{2} = 14 - 6 \]
\[ \frac{A}{2} = 8 \]

Now, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 8 \times 2 \]
\[ A = 16 \]

Therefore, Fred's weekly allowance is $16.

To find Fred's weekly allowance, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance by \( A \).

1. Fred spent half of his allowance on movies, so he spent \( \frac{A}{2} \).
2. After spending this amount, Fred earned 6 dollars from washing the car.

After going to the movies, he earned 6 dollars from washing the family car, so he was left with \( \frac{1}{2}A + 6 \).

We know that after these transactions, Fred ended up with 14 dollars. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}A + 6 = 14 \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):

Subtract 6 from both sides:

Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance as \( A \).

Fred spent half of his allowance on going to the movies. Therefore, he spent \( \frac{A}{2} \) dollars. After spending this amount, he had \( A - \frac{A}{2} = \frac{A}{2} \) dollars left.

He then earned 6 dollars by washing the family car, so his total amount of money became \( \frac{A}{2} + 6 \) dollars.

According to the problem, after earning the 6 dollars, Fred ended up with 14 dollars. Thus, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]

Now, let's solve this equation to find \( A \):

\[ \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]
\[ \frac{A}{2} = 14 - 6 \]
\[ \frac{A}{2} = 8 \]
\[ A = 8 \times 2 \]
\[ A = 16 \]

Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance as \( A \).

According to the problem, Fred spent half of his allowance on movies. Therefore, the amount he spent on movies is \( \frac{A}{2} \).

Fred earned 6 dollars by washing the family car, so the total money he had after earning the 6 dollars is \( \frac{A}{2} + 6 \).

Finally, after spending half of his allowance on movies, Fred was left with 14 dollars. This can be expressed as:

\[ \frac{A}{2} + 6 - \frac{A}{2} = 14 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 6 = 14 \]

This doesn't make sense because it's not true. Let's re-examine the problem.

Fred's total money after earning 6 dollars and spending half of his allowance is 14 dollars. Since he spent half of his allowance on movies, we need to find half of his allowance before earning the 6 dollars.

\[ \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14 \]

Now we solve for \( A \):

\[ \frac{A}{2} = 14 - 6 \]
\[ \frac{A}{2} = 8 \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Fred's weekly allowance is 16 dollars.
