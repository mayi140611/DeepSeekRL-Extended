To determine how many more hours Sam needs to work, first, we need to calculate his hourly wage from March to August. Sam made $460 in 23 hours, so his hourly wage is:

\[ \text{Hourly wage} = \frac{\$460}{23 \text{ hours}} = \$20 \text{ per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours Sam has worked from September to February. Sam worked for 8 hours each month, so from September to February, he worked for 8 months:

\[ \text{Total hours worked from September to February} = 8 \text{ hours/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Since we know his hourly wage, we can calculate the amount he earned from these 8 hours:

\[ \text{Amount earned from September to February} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20 \text{ per hour} = \$160 \]

Now, let's determine how much money Sam has saved after working for 24 hours. Sam has fixed his car for $340, and he has earned $160 from working, so his total savings are:

\[ \text{Total savings} = \$340 + \$160 = \$500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money Sam needs to buy the video game console that costs $600:

\[ \text{Amount needed} = \$600 - \$500 = \$100 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many more hours Sam needs to work to earn $100. Since Sam earns $20 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work is:

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\$100}{\$20 \text{ per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Sam needs to work 5 more hours before he can buy the video game console.

From March to August, Sam earned $460 in 23 hours of work.
Therefore, from September to February, he earned $460 / 23 = $20 per hour.

In September to February, he earned $20 * 8 = $160.

In total, he has earned $460 + $160 = $620.

The video game console costs $600 and he has already spent $340 fixing his car, so he still needs $620 - $600 = $20.

Since he earns $20 per hour, he needs to work 20 / 20 = 1 more hour.

To determine how many more hours Sam needs to work before he can buy the video game console, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Sam's hourly wage from his income.
2. Calculate his total savings.
3. Determine how much more he needs to save.
4. Calculate how many more hours he needs to work.

First, let's calculate Sam's hourly wage from his income. He made $460 in 23 hours, so his hourly wage is:
\[ \text{Hourly wage} = \frac{460}{23} = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, let's calculate his total savings. He has already made $460 in March and September to fix his car, which is $340 in total. So, his total savings are:
\[ \text{Total savings} = 460 + 340 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's determine how much more he needs to save to buy the video game console, which costs $600:
\[ \text{Amount needed} = 600 - 800 = -200 \text{ dollars} \]
Since he already has more than enough money, he doesn't need to work any more hours. His savings are $160 more than the cost of the video game console.

To determine how many more hours Sam needs to work, we first need to calculate how much money he has made so far and how much more he needs to save.

Sam made $460 in March to August, which is 23 hours. So, his hourly rate is:
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{460}{23} = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Sam needs to work from September to February to make up the $600 needed for the video game console, excluding the $340 already spent on fixing his car. Sam needs:
\[ 600 - 340 = 260 \text{ dollars more} \]

Using his hourly rate of $20 per hour, we can find out how many hours he needs to work to make $260:
\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{260}{20} = 13 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Sam needs to work 13 more hours before he can buy the video game console.

Sam made $460 in March to August, which is a period of 6 months, and he worked 23 hours each month. Therefore his total working hours from March to August is \(23 \text{ hours/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 138 \text{ hours}\). 

The remaining months (September to February) are 4 months, so he worked 8 hours a month there, which equals \(8 \text{ hours/month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 32 \text{ hours}\).

In total, Sam's total hours worked is 138 hours (March to August) + 32 hours (September to February) = 170 hours.

There are 60 hours in a week, so the total hours in four months (February to May) is 4 \(\times\) 4 weeks \(\times\) 60 hours/week = 960 hours.

If Sam needs to save up \$600 for a video-game console and he has already spent \$340 to fix his car, he has already saved \(\$600 - \$340 = \$260\).

To find out how many more hours he needs work to save up for the video game console, we calculate the ratio of \$260 to \(600 \text{ hours} / 96 \text{ hours} = 5/60\) of the total hours required to save \(600\) dollars.

\[ \text{Remaining hours needed} = \frac{5}{60} \times 600 = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Solving the above equation gives \( \frac{50}{50/96} = 96\).

To determine how much money Sam still needs, we first calculate his earnings from March to August and the earnings from September to February.

From March to August (5 months), Sam made $460 working 23 hours.

From September to February (6 months), Sam made $460 working 8 hours.

Total earnings: $460 + $460 = $920

Sam still needs $600 - $340 = $260 to afford the video game console.

Sam needs $260 after earning $920, so he has already earned enough to buy the video game console.

Therefore, Sam does not need to work any more hours to buy the video game console.

Sam made $460 in March to August, but he only worked 23 hours.
The hourly wage is $460 / 23 = $20 per hour.
From September to February, Sam worked 8 hours, which earned him 8 * 20 = $160.
So far, Sam has earned $460 + $160 = $620.
The video game console costs $600.

Sam has already spent $340 to fix his car, so he still needs $600 - $340 = $260 to buy the console.

Sam has already earned $620, so he has enough money. He does not need to work any more hours before he can buy the video game console.

To determine how many more hours Sam needs to work, let's first calculate his hourly wage.

From March to August, Sam made $460 in 23 hours. To find his hourly wage, we divide his total earnings by the number of hours he worked:

\[ \text{Hourly Wage} = \frac{\$460}{23 \text{ hours}} \]

\[ \text{Hourly Wage} = \$20 \text{ per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from September to February. Sam worked for 8 hours, so:

\[ \text{Earnings from September to February} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20 \text{ per hour} \]

\[ \text{Earnings from September to February} = \$160 \]

Now, let's find out how much Sam has saved so far, which includes the earnings from March to August and the earnings from September to February:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$460 + \$160 \]

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$620 \]

Given that Sam's video game console costs $600 and he has already spent $340 to fix his car, his budget for the video game console after the car repair is:

\[ \text{Remaining Budget} = \$600 - \$340 \]

\[ \text{Remaining Budget} = \$260 \]

To determine the number of hours Sam needs to work to save the remaining amount for the video game console, we divide the remaining budget by his hourly wage:

\[ \text{Hours Needed} = \frac{\$260}{\$20 \text{ per hour}} \]

\[ \text{Hours Needed} = 13 \text{ hours} \]

So, Sam needs to work an additional 13 hours before he can buy the video game console.

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{460}{23} = 20 \]

From September to February, he worked 8 hours, so he made:

Now we find out how much money Sam has saved in total. The cost of the car repair is $340, and he has saved from his yard work:

\[ 460 - 340 = 120 \]

So, he has $120 from yard work. Adding the savings from September to February:

\[ 120 + 160 = 280 \]

Now, we calculate how much more Sam needs to save to buy the video game console, which costs $600:

\[ 600 - 280 = 320 \]

To find out how many more hours he needs to work to save $320, we use his hourly rate:

\[ \frac{320}{20} = 16 \]

So, Sam needs to work 16 more hours.

First, we need to determine how much Sam earned per hour from March to August. We know he made $460 in 23 hours, so his hourly wage is $460 / 23 hours = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sam has earned since March to February. From March to August, he worked for 7 months (i.e., 210 days), but we only need to account for the 120 days from March to August. So, he worked 120 hours since March to August and earned $460. 

For the 8-hour period from September to February, we need to calculate his hourly wage for this period. Since he gave up 20 hours of his regular work, he only worked 8 hours per day for 9 days. Thus, his earnings during this period are 9 days * 8 hours/day * $20/hour = $1440.

Adding both periods together, Sam has earned $460 + $1440 = $1900 since March to February.

Sam saved $340 to fix his car and he needs $600 to buy a video game console, making it a total need of $340 + $600 = $940.

Lastly, we need to determine the number of hours Sam needs to work to earn the $560 he needs. Therefore, he needs to work $560 / $20 per hour = 28 hours.

Now, we will calculate how much more he needs to earn before he can buy the video game console. Since he already has $1900, he has more than enough to pay for both his car repairs and the video game console. Therefore, he does not need to work any more hours to buy the video game console.

So, he does not need to work any more hours.

From March to August, Sam made $460 for 23 hours of yard work.

From September to February, Sam was able to work for 8 hours.

First, let's calculate the hourly wage Sam earned each month.

Hourly Wage = Total Earnings / Hours of Work
Hourly Wage = $460 / 23 hours
Hourly Wage = $20 per hour

Now, let's calculate how much Sam made from September to February.

Earnings from September to February = Hourly Wage * Number of Hours
Earnings from September to February = $20 per hour * 8 hours
Earnings from September to February = $160

Now let's calculate the total amount Sam has already spent.

Total Amount Spent = Cost of Video Game Console + Cost to Fix Car
Total Amount Spent = $600 + $340
Total Amount Spent = $940

Sam needs a total of $940 for the video game console, but he has already spent $940. That means he is at the cost of the video game console and doesn't need to work any more.

Therefore, the answer is Sam does not need to work any more hours.

To calculate how many more hours Sam needs to work, we first need to find out how much he needs to earn in total to buy the video game console.

Total cost of the video game console = $600
Amount spent on fixing his car = $340
Total cost to be earned = Total cost - Amount spent on car
Total cost to be earned = $600 - $340 = $260

Now, we can determine how much Sam needs to earn per hour.

Amount earned from March to August = $460
Number of hours worked from March to August = 23

Earnings per hour = Amount earned / Hours worked from March to August
Earnings per hour = $460 / 23 = $20

Sam needs to earn $260 to buy the video game console. We can now calculate how many more hours he needs to work at $20 per hour.

Total hours needed = Total cost to be earned / Earnings per hour
Total hours needed = $260 / $20 = 13 hours

So, Sam needs to work 13 more hours before he can buy the video game console.

First, we need to determine Sam's hourly wage. He made $460 over 23 hours, so his hourly wage is $460 / 23 hours = $20 per hour.

Next, we calculate his earnings from September to February, which is 8 hours of work at $20 per hour, giving him $20 * 8 = $160.

Now, we know Sam's total earnings are the sum of his earnings from March to August and September to February. Hence, his total earnings are $460 + $160 = $620.

Sam has already spent $340 on fixing his car. Therefore, his total savings are $620 (total earnings) - $340 (spent) = $280.

To buy the video game console, which costs $600, Sam still needs $600 - $280 = $320 more in savings.

Since Sam earns $20 per hour, he needs $320 / $20 per hour = 16 more hours of work to reach his goal.

To determine how many more hours Sam needs to work to buy the video game console, we will first calculate his hourly wage and the total amount he has already spent.

From March to August, Sam made $460 from 23 hours of work. Therefore, his hourly wage is:
\[ \text{Hourly Wage} = \frac{460}{23} = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

From September to February, Sam worked for 8 hours, earning:
\[ \text{Earnings from September to February} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the earnings from both periods gives us the total amount Sam has earned so far:

Sam has already spent $340 to fix his car, so his remaining budget for the video game console is:
\[ \text{Remaining Budget} = 620 - 340 = 280 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the video game console is $600, so the additional amount Sam needs is:

Since Sam earns $20 per hour, the number of additional hours he needs to work is:
