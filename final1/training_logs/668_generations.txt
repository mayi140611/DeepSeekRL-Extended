system
To determine how much Harris will spend on carrots in one year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many carrots Harris consumes in one year.
2. Determine how many bags of carrots are needed for one year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the bags of carrots.

First, convert the 1-pound bag into daily consumption:
Since Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot per day, in one year (which has 365 days), Harris will consume 365 carrots.

Next, calculate how many bags of carrots are needed for one year:
There are 5 carrots in a 1-pound bag. Therefore, the number of bags required is:
\[ \frac{365 \text{ carrots}}{5 \text{ carrots per bag}} = 73 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $2.00, so the total cost for 73 bags is:
\[ 73 \text{ bags} \times 2 \text{ dollars per bag} = 146 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, in one year, Harris will spend $146 on carrots.

To determine how much Harris will spend on carrots in one year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of carrots Harris uses per day.
2. Determine the number of carrot bags needed per day.
3. Calculate the number of carrot bags needed per week.
4. Determine the number of carrot bags needed per year.
5. Calculate the total cost for the year.

Step 1: Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot per day.

Step 2: There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag. To find out how many bags are needed per day:
\[ \text{Number of bags per day} = \frac{1 \text{ carrot}}{5 \text{ carrots per bag}} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ bags per day} \]

Step 3: There are 7 days in a week, so the number of bags needed per week:
\[ \text{Number of bags per week} = 7 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{7}{5} \text{ bags per week} \]

Step 4: There are 52 weeks in a year. So the number of bags needed per year:
\[ \text{Number of bags per year} = 52 \times \frac{7}{5} = \frac{364}{5} = 72.8 \text{ bags per year} \]

Step 5: Each bag costs $2.00. Therefore, the total cost for one year:
\[ \text{Total cost per year} = 72.8 \text{ bags} \times 2 \text{ dollars per bag} = 145.6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Harris will spend $145.60 on carrots in one year.

system
To determine how much Harris will spend on carrots in one year, we need to first calculate the total number of carrots he needs for a year and then determine how many bags and the corresponding cost.

1. **Daily Carrots Needed**: Harris feeds his dog 1 carrot per day.

2. **Weekly Carrots Needed**: There are 7 days in a week, so Harris needs \(1 \times 7 = 7\) carrots per week.

3. **Monthly Carrots Needed**: There are approximately 4.33 weeks in a month (since 1 year has 52 weeks and 4 days in a leap year).
   
   \[
   7 \text{ carrots/week} \times 4.33 \text{ weeks/month} \approx 30.31 \text{ carrots/month}
   \]
   For simplicity, we'll round to 30 carrots per month.

4. **Annual Carrots Needed**: There are 12 months in a year, so Harris needs \(30 \times 12 = 360\) carrots per year.

5. **Number of Bags Needed**: There are 5 carrots in a pound bag and each bag costs $2.00.

   \[
   \frac{360 \text{ carrots}}{5 \text{ carrots/bag}} = 72 \text{ bags}
   \]

6. **Total Cost**: The cost per bag is $2.00.

   \[
   72 \text{ bags} \times \$2.00/\text{bag} = \$144.00
   \]

**Conclusion**: Harris will spend \$144.00 on carrots in one year.

To determine how much Harris will spend on carrots in one year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of carrots Harris uses per day**: 
   Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot per day. Therefore, he uses 1 carrot per day.

2. **Determine how many carrots Harris uses in a year**:
   There are 365 days in a year (we'll ignore leap years for simplicity). So, in one year, Harris will use:
   \[
   1 \text{ carrot/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} = 365 \text{ carrots/year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of 1-pound bags needed for 365 carrots**:
   Each bag contains 5 carrots. The number of bags needed is:
   \[
   \frac{365 \text{ carrots}}{5 \text{ carrots/bag}} = 73 \text{ bags}
   \]

4. **Determine the total cost of 73 bags**:
   Each bag costs $2.00. Thus, the total cost is:
   \[
   73 \text{ bags} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bag} = 146 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total annual cost for carrots**:
   Since Harris can only purchase whole bags, he will need to buy 73 bags. Therefore, the total cost for one year is:
   \[
   146 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Account for the annual need**:
   Since Harris needs 365 carrots per year, and each bag provides 5 carrots, he needs:
   \[
   \frac{365 \text{ carrots}}{5 \text{ carrots/bag}} = 73 \text{ bags}
   \]

Thus, the total cost Harris will incur on carrots in one year is:
\[
\boxed{146 \text{ dollars}}
\]

First, we need to determine how many large organic carrots Harris's dog will consume in one year. Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot per day. Assuming a year has 365 days, this means his dog will consume 365 carrots in one year.

Next, we calculate the number of pounds of carrots needed for this amount, given that each bag contains 5 carrots. We divide the total number of carrots needed by the number of carrots per bag: 365 carrots / 5 carrots per bag = 73 bags of carrots.

Now, we calculate the total cost of these bags. Since each bag costs $2.00, the total cost will be 73 bags * $2.00 per bag = $146.00.

Therefore, Harris will spend $146.00 on carrots in one year.

To determine how much Harris will spend on carrots in one year, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he will consume in one year and then find out the cost based on the price per carrot.

First, let's calculate the total number of carrots Harris will eat in one year:
1. Number of carrots Harris eats per day: 1 large organic carrot.
2. Number of days in a year: 365.
3. Total carrots per year: \( 1 \text{ carrot/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} = 365 \text{ carrots} \).

Next, we need to find out how many bags of carrots Harris will need. Each bag contains 5 carrots:
1. Number of bags required: \( \frac{365 \text{ carrots}}{5 \text{ carrots/bag}} = 73 \text{ bags} \).

Now, we calculate the total cost of these bags:
1. Cost per bag: $2.00.
