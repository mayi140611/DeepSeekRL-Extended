#### GENERATION 8 RESPONSE ####

system
Let \( T \) represent the number of text messages Keiko sent last week.

This week, she sent \( 2T - 50 \) text messages.

To find the total number of text messages sent last week and this week combined, we add the two expressions:

\[ T + (2T - 50) = 3T - 50 \]

Given \( T = 111 \):

\[ 3 \times 111 - 50 \]
\[ 333 - 50 \]
\[ = 283 \]

Therefore, the total number of text messages Keiko sent last week and this week combined is 283.

#### GENERATION 15 RESPONSE ####

system
Keiko sent 111 text messages last week. This week, she sent 50 less than double what she sent last week. 
To find out how many text messages she sent this week, we need to double the number of messages she sent last week and then subtract 50.
Double the number of messages sent last week: 111 x 2 = 222 text messages
Now, subtract 50 from the doubled number: 222 - 50 = 172 text messages
So, Keiko sent 172 text messages this week.
To find out how many text messages she sent last week and this week combined, we need to add the number of messages sent last week and this week.
Total number of messages sent: 111 + 172 = 283 text messages
Therefore, Keiko sent 283 text messages last week and this week combined.
