system
To find the combined total number of stripes, we need to calculate the number of stripes for each type of hat and then sum them up.

1. Vaishali has 4 hats with 3 stripes each.
   \[
   4 \text{ hats} \times 3 \text{ stripes/hat} = 12 \text{ stripes}
   \]

2. She has 3 hats with 4 stripes each.
   \[
   3 \text{ hats} \times 4 \text{ stripes/hat} = 12 \text{ stripes}
   \]

3. She has 6 hats with no stripes.
   \[
   6 \text{ hats} \times 0 \text{ stripes/hat} = 0 \text{ stripes}
   \]

4. She has 2 hats with 5 stripes each.
   \[
   2 \text{ hats} \times 5 \text{ stripes/hat} = 10 \text{ stripes}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the stripes:
\[
12 \text{ stripes} (from 4 hats with 3 stripes) + 12 \text{ stripes} (from 3 hats with 4 stripes) + 0 \text{ stripes} (from 6 hats with no stripes) + 10 \text{ stripes} (from 2 hats with 5 stripes) = 34 \text{ stripes}
\]

Therefore, the combined total number of stripes Vaishali has on all her hats is 34.

To find the combined total number of stripes Vaishali has on all of her hats, let's calculate the number of stripes on each type of hat and then sum them up.

1. Hats with three stripes:
   Vaishali has 4 hats with 3 stripes each. 
   Therefore, the total number of stripes on these hats is:
   \[
   4 \text{ hats} \times 3 \text{ stripes per hat} = 12 \text{ stripes}
   \]

2. Hats with four stripes:
   Vaishali has 3 hats with 4 stripes each.
   Therefore, the total number of stripes on these hats is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hats} \times 4 \text{ stripes per hat} = 12 \text{ stripes}
   \]

3. Hats with no stripes:
   Vaishali has 6 hats with 0 stripes each.
   Therefore, the total number of stripes on these hats is:
   \[
   6 \text{ hats} \times 0 \text{ stripes per hat} = 0 \text{ stripes}
   \]

4. Hats with five stripes:
   Vaishali has 2 hats with 5 stripes each.
   Therefore, the total number of stripes on these hats is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hats} \times 5 \text{ stripes per hat} = 10 \text{ stripes}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the stripes:
\[
12 \text{ stripes (three-striped hats)} + 12 \text{ stripes (four-striped hats)} + 0 \text{ stripes (no-striped hats)} + 10 \text{ stripes (five-striped hats)} = 34 \text{ stripes}
\]

So, the combined total number of stripes Vaishali has on all of her hats is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]

To find the total number of stripes Vaishali has, we calculate the number of stripes for each type of hat and then sum them up.

1. Vaishali has 4 hats with 3 stripes each:
   \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) stripes

2. She has 3 hats with 4 stripes each:
   \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) stripes

3. She has 6 hats with no stripes:
   \( 6 \times 0 = 0 \) stripes

4. She has 2 hats with 5 stripes each:
   \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) stripes

Now, we add up the stripes from each category:
- For the 4-striped hats: \( 12 \) stripes
- For the 3-striped hats: \( 12 \) stripes
- For the 5-striped hats: \( 10 \) stripes

Total striped hats with stripes: \( 12 + 12 + 10 = 34 \) stripes

Since she has no-striped hats, the total number of stripes on all her hats is the total from the striped hats plus the none-striped hats:
- Stripes from the 6 none-striped hats: \( 0 \) stripes
- Stripes from the two 5-striped hats: \( 10 \) stripes

Total combined stripes: \( 34 + 0 + 10 = 44 \) stripes

To find the combined total number of stripes, we need to calculate the total number of stripes for each type of hat and then add them all together.

1. For the 4 hats with 3 stripes each:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ stripes} \]

2. For the 3 hats with 4 stripes each:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ stripes} \]

3. For the 6 hats with no stripes:
\[ 6 \times 0 = 0 \text{ stripes} \]

4. For the 2 hats with 5 stripes each:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ stripes} \]

Next, we add the stripes from each group together:
\[ 12 + 12 + 0 + 10 = 34 \text{ stripes} \]

Therefore, the combined total number of stripes Vaishali has on all of her hats is 34.

To find the total number of stripes on all of Vaishali's hats, we'll calculate the stripes for each type of hat separately and then sum them up.

First, for the hats with three stripes each:
\[ 4 \text{ hats} \times 3 \text{ stripes/hat} = 12 \text{ stripes} \]

Next, for the three hats with four stripes each:
\[ 3 \text{ hats} \times 4 \text{ stripes/hat} = 12 \text{ stripes} \]

Then, for the six hats with no stripes:
\[ 6 \text{ hats} \times 0 \text{ stripes/hat} = 0 \text{ stripes} \]

And finally, for the two hats with five stripes each:
\[ 2 \text{ hats} \times 5 \text{ stripes/hat} = 10 \text{ stripes} \]

Now, we add these totals together:
\[ 12 \text{ stripes} + 12 \text{ stripes} + 0 \text{ stripes} + 10 \text{ stripes} = 34 \text{ stripes} \]

Therefore, the combined total number of stripes Vaishali has on all her hats is 34 stripes.

To find the total number of stripes on Vaishali's hats, we can calculate the number of stripes for each type of hat and then sum them up.

1. For the hats with 3 stripes each:
   - Vaishali has 4 hats with 3 stripes each.
   - Total stripes = 4 hats * 3 stripes/hat = 12 stripes.

2. For the hats with 4 stripes each:
   - Vaishali has 3 hats with 4 stripes each.
   - Total stripes = 3 hats * 4 stripes/hat = 12 stripes.

3. For the hats with no stripes:
   - Vaishali has 6 hats with no stripes.
   - Total stripes = 6 hats * 0 stripes/hat = 0 stripes.

4. For the hats with 5 stripes each:
   - Vaishali has 2 hats with 5 stripes each.
   - Total stripes = 2 hats * 5 stripes/hat = 10 stripes.

Now, we sum up all the stripes:
Total stripes = 12 (from 3-striped hats) + 12 (from 4-striped hats) + 0 (from no-striped hats) + 10 (from 5-striped hats)
Total stripes = 12 + 12 + 0 + 10 = 34 stripes.

Therefore, the combined total number of stripes Vaishali has on all of her hats is 34 stripes.

To find the combined total number of stripes, we need to calculate the number of stripes on each type of hat and then sum them up.

1. **Hats with 3 stripes each**:
   - Vaishali has 4 hats with 3 stripes each.
   - Total stripes on these hats: \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

2. **Hats with 4 stripes each**:
   - Vaishali has 3 hats with 4 stripes each.

To find the combined total number of stripes on all of Vaishali's hats, we need to calculate the number of stripes on each type of hat and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stripes on the hats with one type of stripe:
- Vaishali has 4 hats with three stripes each. So, the total number of stripes on these hats is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

Next, let's calculate the number of stripes on the hats with another type of stripe:
- Vaishali has 3 hats with four stripes each. So, the total number of stripes on these hats is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

Now, let's calculate the number of stripes on the hats with no stripes:
- Vaishali has 6 hats with no stripes each. So, the total number of stripes on these hats is \(6 \times 0 = 0\).

Finally, let's calculate the number of stripes on the hats with another type of stripe:
- Vaishali has 2 hats with five stripes each. So, the total number of stripes on these hats is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now, we sum up all the stripes:
\[12 + 12 + 0 + 10 = 34\]

Therefore, the combined total number of stripes Vaishali has on all of her hats is \(34\).
