209
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To calculate the expected number of attendees after accounting for the non-showers, we multiply the total number of people expected by the percentage who typically attend. 

So, 
\[ \text{Expected attendees} = 220 \times (1 - 0.05) \]
\[ \text{Expected attendees} = 220 \times 0.95 \]
\[ \text{Expected attendees} = 209 \]

system
To calculate the number of people who will actually attend, we need to subtract the expected number of no-shows from the total expected attendance.

First, determine the number of people who typically don't show, which is 5% of the total attendance:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 220 = 0.05 \times 220 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of attendees will be:
\[ 220 - 11 = 209 \]

So, the number of people who will attend Laura's wedding is 209.

In this case, we will have approximately 0.05 x 220 = 11 fewer people who will be present at the wedding than are expected. So, only 220 - 11 = 209 people will be attending the wedding.

To find out how many people will actually attend the wedding, we need to calculate 95% of the expected number of attendees because 5% typically don't show up. 

So, the calculation will be: 
number of attendees = 220 * 0.95

Let's calculate this: 
Calculation: 220 * 0.95 = 209

Therefore, the answer is 209 people will go to her wedding.

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####

system
To find out how many people will go to Laura's wedding, we need to calculate 5% of the expected 220 attendees, since typically 5% don't show up.

5% of 220 can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of no-shows} = 220 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Number of no-shows} = 220 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Number of no-shows} = 11 \]

Now, subtract the number of no-shows from the total to find the expected number of attendees:

\[ \text{Expected number of attendees} = 220 - 11 \]
\[ \text{Expected number of attendees} = 209 \]

So, approximately 209 people will go to Laura's wedding.

To determine how many people will attend Laura's wedding, we need to account for the 5% who typically don't show. 

Let's start by calculating 5% of the expected 220 attendees:
\[ 220 \times 0.05 = 11 \]

This means 11 people typically don't show up.

Next, we subtract this number from the total expected attendees to find out how many will actually attend:
\[ 220 - 11 = 209 \]

So, 209 people will go to the wedding.

First, we need to determine the percentage of people who typically don't show. Laura expects 5%, or 0.05, of the expected attendees to not show up.
Next, we need to find out how many of those people typically don't show up. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of expected attendees by the percentage of those who typically don't show up: 220 * 0.05 = 11.
Therefore, on average, about 11 people who typically don't show up will show up to Laura's wedding.

To find out how many people will actually attend Laura's wedding, we first need to calculate 5% of 220 people. 

\( 5\% \) of 220 is calculated as \( \frac{5}{100} \times 220 \).

\( = \frac{5}{100} \times 220 \)
\( = 0.05 \times 220 \)
\( = 11 \)

So, approximately 5 people don't show up.

Now, we subtract this number from the expected number of attendees:

\( 220 - 11 = 209 \)

So, 209 people will go to Laura's wedding.

To determine the number of people who will attend Laura's wedding, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees who will not show up. Since about 5% typically don't show, this percentage can be applied to the total expected number of attendees.

Expected attendees who won't show = 5% of 220
= 0.05 * 220

Now, we can calculate this value to find out how many people won't show up.

0.05 * 220 = 11
</answer>
There will be 11 people who won't show up to Laura's wedding. To find out how many people will go, we subtract the number of people who won't show from the total expected number.

Total expected attendees = 220
Total people who won't show = 11
Total attendees who will go to Laura's wedding = 220 - 11 = 209

There will be 209 people at Laura's wedding.
