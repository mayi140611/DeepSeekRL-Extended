#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
First, we need to determine the number of lilies Nadia bought. The number of lilies is 3/4 times the number of roses, so:

\[ lilies = \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the roses. Each rose costs $5, so:

\[ total\ cost\ of\ roses = 20 \times 5 = 100 \]

For the lilies, they cost twice as much as roses, so each lily costs \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars. Therefore, the total cost for the lilies is:

\[ total\ cost\ of\ lilies = 15 \times 10 = 150 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the roses and lilies to find the total amount of money Nadia spent:

\[ total\ amount\ spent = 100 + 150 = 250 \]

First, let's calculate the number of lilies Nadia needs to buy: \(3/4 \times 20 = 15\) lilies.

Next, calculate the cost of the roses: \(20 \times \$5 = \$100\).

Now, calculate the cost of the lilies. Since lilies cost twice as much as roses, each lily costs \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\). So, for 15 lilies, the total cost is \(15 \times \$10 = \$150\).

Finally, add the cost of roses and lilies to the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers.

Total amount used = Cost of roses + Cost of lilies
                 = \$100 + \$150
                 = \$250.

Nadia bought 20 roses at $5 each, so the cost of roses is 20 * $5 = $100. She bought 3/4 times as many lilies as roses, which means she bought 3/4 * 20 = 15 lilies. Each lily costs twice as much as a rose, so each lily costs $5 * 2 = $10. The cost of lilies is 15 * $10 = $150. Therefore, the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is $100 (roses) + $150 (lilies) = $250.

Nadia was sent to the flower shop to buy 20 roses, and she was told to buy 3/4 times as many lilies as roses, which is 20 * 3/4 = 15 lilies.

The price of each rose is $5, so the total cost of roses is 20 * $5 = $100.
The lily costs twice as much as a rose, so the price for each Lily is 2 * $5 = $10, and the total cost for 15 lilies is 15 * $10 = $150.

Thus, the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is $100 (roses) + $150 (lilies) = $250.

Nadia bought 20 roses, so the cost of the roses is 20 * $5 = $100.
She also bought 3/4 times as many lilies as roses, which means she bought 3/4 * 20 = 15 lilies.
Each lily costs twice as much as a rose, so each lily costs 2 * $5 = $10.
Therefore, the total cost of the lilies is 15 * $10 = $150.
The total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is $100 + $150 = $250.

Nadia bought 20 roses initially. She bought three-fourths as many lilies as roses, which is \(20 \times \frac{3}{4} = 15\) lilies. The cost of roses is $5 each, and each lily costs twice as much, which is $10. The total amount for roses is \(20 \times 5\) and for lilies is \(15 \times 10\). The total cost is the sum of these amounts.

Nadia bought 20 roses and 3/4 * 20 = 15 lilies.

In total, she bought 20 + 15 = 35 flowers.

The cost of the roses is 20 * $5 = $100.

The cost of the lilies is 15 * $10 = $150 (since the cost of lilies is twice the cost of roses).

Therefore, the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is $100 + $150 = $250.

Let's calculate the cost of the roses and lilies individually.

Nadia bought 20 roses at $5 each:
Total cost of roses = 20 roses * $5/rose = $100

Now let's calculate the number of lilies she bought. She bought 3/4 times as many lilies as roses:
Number of lilies = 3/4 * 20 roses = 15 lilies

Each lily costs twice as much as a rose, so:
Cost of each lily = 2 * $5 = $10

Total cost of lilies = 15 lilies * $10/lily = $150

Now let's calculate the total cost of all the flowers:
Total cost = Cost of roses + Cost of lilies
Total cost = $100 + $150 = $250

Nadia bought 20 roses at $5 each, so the cost of roses is:
20 roses * $5/rose = $100

The cost per lily is twice the cost of a rose, so a lily costs:
$5 * 2 = $10

Nadia bought 3/4 times as many lilies as roses, so she bought:
3/4 * 20 roses = 15 lilies

The cost of lilies is:
15 lilies * $10/lily = $150

The total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is:
$100 (roses) + $150 (lilies) = $250
