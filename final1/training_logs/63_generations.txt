###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Shawna's workout goal is 30 situps. On Monday, Shawna was only able to do 12 situps, so she decided that she would make up for the rest on Tuesday. However, she was only able to do 19 situps on Tuesday. How many situps would Shawna have to do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do?

To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of situps Shawna's goal is: 30 situps.
2. Calculate the total number of situps Shawna has already done by adding the situps she did on Monday and Tuesday:
   \[
   12 \text{ (Monday)} + 19 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 31 \text{ situps}
   \]
3. Determine how many more situps she needs to meet her goal. Since she has already done more than 30 situps (31), she doesn't need to do any situps on Wednesday.

Since she already met her goal (and exceeded it by 1 situp), she doesn't need to do any situps on Wednesday.

To find out how many situps Shawna would need to do on Wednesday to meet her goal, we need to add the situps she already did to her goal amount and then subtract the ones she did on Tuesday. Shawna's goal is 30 situps, she did 12 on Monday and 19 on Tuesday. Let's make a calculation to find the answer.

answer

30 situps - 12 situps done on Monday - 19 situps done on Tuesday = 9 situps need to be done on Wednesday

Shawna would need to do 9 situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.

To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of situps Shawna still needs to reach her goal.
2. Calculate the total number of situps Shawna has done so far.
3. Find the difference between the goal and the remaining situps needed, and determine how many situps she needs to do on Wednesday to make up for it.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of situps Shawna still needs to reach her goal.**

Shawna's goal is 30 situps.

She did 12 situps on Monday and 19 situps on Tuesday.
So, the total number of situps she has done so far is:
\[ 12 + 19 = 31 \]

Since she only needs 30 situps to reach her goal, she has already done more than her goal.

**Step 2: Determine how many situps she has already done.**

Shawna already did:
\[ 12 + 19 = 31 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many situps she needs to do on Wednesday.**

Since she has already done more than her goal, she actually exceeded her goal. Therefore, she doesn't need to do any more situps on Wednesday.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{0} \]

Shawna's total goal is 30 situps. She did 12 situps on Monday and 19 on Tuesday. To find out how many she still needs to do, subtract the total number of situps she has done from the total goal.
30 - (12 + 19) = 30 - 31 = -1

Since the result is negative, it means Shawna was already over her goal by 1 situp after Monday and Tuesday. 

Therefore, she would not have any situps left to do on Wednesday, and she would have already met her goal.

**Reasoning:**
To find out how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday, we first need to calculate how many total situps she has missed from Monday and Tuesday combined. Then we can determine the total number of situps she needs to do to meet her goal of 30 situps.

- On Monday, Shawna did 12 situps but her goal is 30 situps, so she missed \(30 - 12 = 18\) situps.
- On Tuesday, Shawna did 19 situps but her goal is 30 situps, so she missed \(30 - 19 = 11\) situps.

Adding the missed situps together, Shawna has missed \(18 + 11 = 29\) situps in total from Monday and Tuesday.

To meet her goal of 30 situps and make up for the missed ones, Shawna needs to do \(30 + 29 = 59\) situps in total.

**Answer:**
Shawna would need to do 59 situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.

To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of situps Shawna needs to do to meet her goal.
   Shawna's goal is 30 situps.

2. Subtract the number of situps she did on Monday.
   Shawna did 12 situps on Monday.
   \[
   30 - 12 = 18
   \]
   So, Shawna needs to do 18 more situps to meet her goal after Monday.

3. Subtract the number of situps she did on Tuesday.
   Shawna did 19 situps on Tuesday.
   \[
   18 - 19 = -1
   \]
   It appears Shawna is unable to do 19 situps after Monday, indicating she fell short. Let's correct this by recalculate for Tuesday's total:
   \[
   12 + 19 = 31 \text{ situps}
   \]
   Now, she should do 31 situps on Tuesday to meet the goal.

4. Since she needs 31 situps on Tuesday to meet her goal, she needs to do the remaining 5 situps on Wednesday to make up for the ones she didn't do on Monday combined:
   \[
   31 - 12 = 19
   \]
   Subtracting 12 because she did 12 on Monday, the remaining is 19, and adding the 19 from Tuesday, she would need 5 more situps on Wednesday to meet her goal after Tuesday's adjustments.

Therefore, Shawna would need to do 5 situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.

To determine how many sit-ups Shawna should do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sit-ups Shawna needs to do to meet her goal:
   \[
   30 \text{ sit-ups} - 12 \text{ sit-ups on Monday} - 19 \text{ sit-ups on Tuesday} = 9 \text{ sit-ups}
   \]
   Shawna needs to do 9 sit-ups on Wednesday to meet her goal.

2. Verify how many sit-ups she needs to do on Wednesday to make up for the ones she didn't do:
   \[
   \text{Total sit-ups needed} - \text{Sit-ups already done on Monday and Tuesday} = \text{Sit-ups to be done on Wednesday}
   \]
   \[
   30 \text{ sit-ups} - 21 \text{ sit-ups} = 9 \text{ sit-ups}

   Shawna needs to do 9 sit-ups on Wednesday to make up for the ones she didn't do and meet her goal.

Therefore, Shawna would have to do 9 sit-ups on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.

To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, we start by calculating the total number of situps she has already done on Monday and Tuesday:

1. On Monday, Shawna did 12 situps.
2. On Tuesday, Shawna did 19 situps.

Adding these together gives us the total number of situps done so far:
\[ 12 + 19 = 31 \]

Shawna's goal is to do 30 situps. Since she has already done 31 situps, which exceeds her goal, she does not need to do any situps on Wednesday to meet her goal. Therefore, the number of situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday is 0.

To find out the total number of situps Shawna needs to do by the end of Wednesday to meet her goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, we need to follow these steps:

First, calculate the total number of situps Shawna has already done:
- On Monday, she did 12 situps.
- On Tuesday, she did 19 situps.

Total situps done so far = 12 (Monday) + 19 (Tuesday) = 31 situps.

Since Shawna's goal is 30 situps, she has already met and potentially exceeded her goal by 1 situp on Monday and is close to her goal on Tuesday but not quite reaching it.

On Wednesday, Shawna would need to do enough situps to meet her goal:
- Her goal is 30 situps.

Since she has already done 31 situps by the end of Wednesday, she will exceed her goal (31 situps) by 1.

Therefore, Shawna would need to do 30 situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum workout goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.

Thus, the total number of situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday is 30.

Shawna's goal is 30 situps. On Monday, she did 12 situps, and on Tuesday, she did 19 situps. Therefore, the total number of situps she has already done is 12 + 19 = 31 situps. To meet her minimum goal of 30 situps, she would need to do 30 - 31 = -1 situps on Wednesday, which indicates she has already done more situps than her goal, hence she doesn't need to do any situps on Wednesday.

To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the total number of situps she has already done. 

On Monday, Shawna did 12 situps. On Tuesday, she did 19 situps. 

Total situps done so far: 
\[ 12 \, \text{situps (Monday)} + 19 \, \text{situps (Tuesday)} = 31 \, \text{situps} \]

Shawna's goal is 30 situps. Therefore, she needs to do:
\[ 30 \, \text{situps (goal)} - 31 \, \text{situps (already done)} = -1 \]

Since she cannot do a negative number of situps, it seems she has either already surpassed her goal or is currently performing fewer situps than the goal. Given the context, it appears Shawna might have an error in her goal setting or her goal is actually 31 situps instead of 30.

If the goal is indeed 31 situps and Shawna has already done 31 situps, she has already met her goal and doesn't need to do any more situps on Wednesday. If she meant to set her goal lower, Shawna would need to determine what 30 situps would look like in terms of her original goal and then calculate the remaining situps she needs to do on Wednesday from that adjusted goal.

Since the problem doesn't specify the correct goal, we can only conclude based on the given information:

**Answer:** Shawna needs to do 0 situps on Wednesday to meet her goal of 30 situps. However, this conclusion relies on the assumption that Shawna was aiming for 31 situps and has already done that, which may not be accurate according to the goal stated initially.

To find out how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total number of situps she needs to do to reach her goal of 30 situps. This can be calculated as follows:

Total situps needed = 30 (goal) - 12 (situps done on Monday) - 19 (situps done on Tuesday)

Total situps needed = 30 - 12 - 19
Total situps needed = 11

So Shawna needs to do 11 more situps on Wednesday to meet her goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.

Shawna's goal is 30 situps.
On Monday, she did 12 situps.
On Tuesday, she did 19 situps.
To meet her goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, Shawna needs to do at least 30 situps.

Now I can answer your question.

On Monday, Shawna was short by at least \( 30 - 12 \) situps.
On Tuesday, Shawna did 19 situps, so she still needs \( 30 - 19 = 11 \) situps.

Therefore, to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, Shawna would have to do at least 11 situps on Wednesday.

To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, we need to calculate the difference between her goal and the total she has already done.

First, let's summarize the situps Shawna has done so far:

- On Monday, she did 12 situps.
- On Tuesday, she did 19 situps.

Total situps done so far:
\[ 12 + 19 = 31 \]

Shawna's goal is 30 situps. To meet her goal and make up for any missed situps, she needs to do an additional number of situps. Since she has already done 31 situps, she actually has exceeded her goal by:
\[ 31 - 30 = 1 \]

This means Shawna has done 1 situp more than her goal, so she does not need to do any situps on Wednesday to meet her goal. However, if we interpret the problem as needing to reach 30, she will need to do:
\[ 30 - 31 = -1 \]
This negative value indicates she has already exceeded her goal by 1 situp, so she doesn't need to do any additional situps. The interpretation needs to be clarified, but based on the calculation, she doesn't need to do any situps on Wednesday.
