The second scroll is \(4080 + \frac{4080}{2} = 4080 + 2040 = 6120\) years old.
The third scroll is \(6120 + \frac{6120}{2} = 6120 + 3060 = 9180\) years old.
The fourth scroll is \(9180 + \frac{9180}{2} = 9180 + 4590 = 13770\) years old.
The fifth scroll is \(13770 + \frac{13770}{2} = 13770 + 6885 = 20655\) years old.

To find the age of the fifth scroll, we first need to calculate the age of the fourth scroll. Since each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll’s age, the fourth scroll is 4080 + 4080/2 = 4080 + 2040 = 6120 years old.

Next, we calculate the age of the third scroll by adding to the age of the fourth scroll the half-reduction effect: 6120 + 6120/2 = 6120 + 3060 = 9180 years old.

For the second scroll, we add to the age of the third scroll that same 2040-year reduction: 9180 + 9180/2 = 9180 + 4590 = 13770 years old.

Finally, the first scroll is the starting point, and the fifth scroll would be the sum of 5 times this starting value: 4080 + 5*4080 = 4080 + 20400 = 24480 years old.

Let's denote the age of the fifth scroll by \( x \). According to the problem, each scroll is older than the previous one by half as many years as the last scroll's age. Therefore, the age of the second scroll is \( x/2 \), the age of the third scroll is \( x/2 + x/2 = x \), the age of the fourth scroll is \( x/2 + x = 3x/2 \), and the age of the fifth scroll is \( x \).

We need to find the age of the fifth scroll, which is \( x \). We can use the information about the age of the first scroll to find the value of \( x \):

1. The first scroll is 4080 years old.
2. The second scroll is \( x/2 \) years old.
3. The third scroll is \( x \) years old (since it is the same age as the second scroll).
4. The fourth scroll is \( 3x/2 \) years old.
5. The fifth scroll is \( x \) years old.

Since all scrolls are the same age after the second scroll, the age of the fifth scroll is the same as the age of the fourth scroll plus half the age of the fourth scroll:

\[ x = \frac{3x}{2} + \frac{x}{4} \]

Let's solve this equation for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6x}{4} + \frac{x}{4} \]
\[ x = \frac{7x}{4} \]
\[ 4x = 7x \]
\[ 4x - 7x = 0 \]
\[ -3x = 0 \]
\[ x = 8400 \]

So, the fifth scroll is 8400 years old.

Let's denote the age of the scrolls as follows:
- Let \( A \) be the age of the first scroll, \( A = 4080 \) years.
- Let \( B \) be the age of the second scroll.
- Let \( C \) be the age of the third scroll.
- Let \( D \) be the age of the fourth scroll.
- Let \( E \) be the age of the fifth scroll.

According to the problem, each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll's age. Therefore, we have:
\[ B = A + \frac{A}{2} = 4080 + 2040 = 6120 \]
\[ C = B + \frac{B}{2} = 6120 + 3060 = 9180 \]
\[ D = C + \frac{C}{2} = 9180 + 4590 = 13770 \]
\[ E = D + \frac{D}{2} = 13770 + 6885 = 20655 \]

Thus, the age of the fifth scroll \( E \) is \( 20655 \) years.

Let's denote the ages of the scrolls as follows: \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 \) for the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth scrolls, respectively.

Given:
- \( A_1 = 4080 \) years old.

According to the problem, each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll’s age. We need to find the age of the fifth scroll, \( A_5 \).

First, let's express \( A_2 \) in terms of \( A_1 \):
\[ A_2 = A_1 + \frac{1}{2} A_1 \]
\[ A_2 = 4080 + \frac{1}{2} \times 4080 \]
\[ A_2 = 4080 + 2040 \]
\[ A_2 = 6120 \]

Next, let's express \( A_3 \) in terms of \( A_2 \):
\[ A_3 = A_2 + \frac{1}{2} A_2 \]
\[ A_3 = 6120 + \frac{1}{2} \times 6120 \]
\[ A_3 = 6120 + 3060 \]
\[ A_3 = 9180 \]

Then, let's express \( A_4 \) in terms of \( A_3 \):
\[ A_4 = A_3 + \frac{1}{2} A_3 \]
\[ A_4 = 9180 + \frac{1}{2} \times 9180 \]
\[ A_4 = 9180 + 4590 \]
\[ A_4 = 13770 \]

Finally, let’s express \( A_5 \) in terms of \( A_4 \):
\[ A_5 = A_4 + \frac{1}{2} A_4 \]
\[ A_5 = 13770 + \frac{1}{2} \times 13770 \]
\[ A_5 = 13770 + 6885 \]
\[ A_5 = 20655 \]

So, the fifth scroll is \( 20655 \) years old.

The first scroll is 4080 years old. 
Let's denote the age of the first scroll as \( A_1 = 4080 \) years.

The age of the second scroll is twice the age of the first scroll plus half the age of the first scroll:
\[ A_2 = 2 \times A_1 + 0.5 \times A_1 = 3 \times A_1 = 3 \times 4080 = 12240 \text{ years old} \]

The age of the third scroll is twice the age of the second scroll plus half the age of the second scroll:
\[ A_3 = 2 \times A_2 + 0.5 \times A_2 = 3 \times A_2 = 3 \times 12240 = 36720 \text{ years old} \]

The age of the fourth scroll is twice the age of the third scroll plus half the age of the third scroll:
\[ A_4 = 2 \times A_3 + 0.5 \times A_3 = 3 \times A_3 = 3 \times 36720 = 110160 \text{ years old} \]

The age of the fifth scroll is twice the age of the fourth scroll plus half the age of the fourth scroll:

To find the age of the fifth scroll, we first need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the age of the first scroll as \( S_1 \), the second scroll as \( S_2 \), the third scroll as \( S_3 \), the fourth scroll as \( S_4 \), and the fifth scroll as \( S_5 \).

Given:
- \( S_1 = 4080 \) years
- Each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll's age.

This can be expressed mathematically as:

- \( S_2 = S_1 - \left(\frac{S_1}{2}\right) \)
- \( S_3 = S_2 - \left(\frac{S_2}{2}\right) \)
- \( S_4 = S_3 - \left(\frac{S_3}{2}\right) \)
- \( S_5 = S_4 - \left(\frac{S_4}{2}\right) \)

Now, calculating step by step:

1. Calculate \( S_2 \):

\[ S_2 = 4080 - \left(\frac{4080}{2}\right) \]
\[ S_2 = 4080 - 2040 \]
\[ S_2 = 2040 \]

2. Calculate \( S_3 \):

\[ S_3 = 2040 - \left(\frac{2040}{2}\right) \]
\[ S_3 = 2040 - 1020 \]
\[ S_3 = 1020 \]

3. Calculate \( S_4 \):

\[ S_4 = 1020 - \left(\frac{1020}{2}\right) \]
\[ S_4 = 1020 - 510 \]
\[ S_4 = 510 \]

4. Calculate \( S_5 \):

\[ S_5 = 510 - \left(\frac{510}{2}\right) \]
\[ S_5 = 510 - 255 \]
\[ S_5 = 255 \]

So, the fifth scroll is 255 years old.

The problem states that each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll’s age. This means:
\[ A_2 = A_1 + \frac{1}{2}A_1 = A_1 \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right) = 1.5 \times 4080 \]
