To determine how much money Tom makes, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract them from his total income.

First, we calculate the cost of the flour:
- Each bag of flour weighs 50 pounds and costs $20, so the cost for 500 pounds is \( \frac{500}{50} \times 20 = 1000 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the salt:
- Tom needs 10 pounds of salt and the cost is $0.2 per pound, so the total cost is \( 10 \times 0.2 = 2 \) dollars.

We also include the promotional expenses:
- The cost for promotion is $1000.

In total, Tom's expenses amount to \( 1000 + 2 + 1000 = 2002 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the income from selling tickets:
- Tom's income from ticket sales is \( 500 \times 20 = 10000 \) dollars.

Thus, Tom's profit is the difference between his total income and expenses: \( 10000 - 2002 = 7998 \) dollars.

To determine how much money Tom made, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract them from his total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of the flour:
Tom needs 500 pounds of flour, and he can buy 50-pound bags for $20 each.
- Number of 50-pound bags needed: \( \frac{500 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds per bag}} = 10 \text{ bags} \)
- Total cost of flour: \( 10 \text{ bags} \times \$20 \text{ per bag} = \$200 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of the salt:
Tom needs 10 pounds of salt, and it costs $0.2 per pound.
- Total cost of salt: \( 10 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.2 \text{ per pound} = \$2 \)

Now, we add the cost of promoting everything, which is $1000.
- Total expenses so far: $200 (flour) + $2 (salt) + $1000 (promotion) = $1202

Tom also earns $20 per ticket, and he sold 500 tickets.
- Total revenue: \( 500 \text{ tickets} \times \$20 \text{ per ticket} = \$10000 \)

To find out how much money Tom made, we subtract the total expenses from the total revenue:
- Money made: $10000 - $1202 = $8798

Therefore, Tom made $8798.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the flour. Tom needs 500 pounds of flour and can buy 50-pound bags for $20 each. So, he would need 500/50 = 10 bags of flour. The total cost of the flour would then be 10 * $20 = $200.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the salt. Tom needs 10 pounds of salt and it costs $.2 a pound. So, the total cost of the salt would be 10 * $.2 = $2.

Additionally, Tom spends $1000 on promoting his event.

Now, we have the total cost of flour, salt, and promotion. The total cost would be $200 + $2 + $1000 = $1202. 

Tom sells tickets for $20 each and sells 500 tickets. So, the total revenue he makes is 500 * $20 = $10000.

Now, to find out how much money he made, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. So, $10000 - $1202 = $8798.

- Cost of flour: $200
- Cost of salt: $2
- Promotion expenses: $1000
- Total cost: \( 200 + 2 + 1000 = 1202 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the revenue from ticket sales:
- Tom sells 500 tickets at $20 each.
- Total revenue from ticket sales is \( 500 \times 20 = 10000 \) dollars.

Finally, calculate the net profit:
- Total revenue from ticket sales: $10000
- Total costs: $1202
- Net profit: \( 10000 - 1202 = 8798 \) dollars.

Therefore, Tom makes $8798.

First, let's calculate the total amount of flour Tom needs to buy. Since he needs 500 pounds of flour and each bag contains 50 pounds, he will need to buy 500 / 50 = 10 bags of flour. The cost of each bag is $20, so the total cost for the flour is 10 * $20 = $200.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the salt. Since he needs 10 pounds of salt and each pound costs $0.2, the total cost for the salt is 10 * $0.2 = $2.

The cost of promoting everything is $1000. Now, let's add up all these costs to find out the total expenses: $200 (flour) + $2 (salt) + $1000 (promotion) = $1202.

The total amount of money Tom made from ticket sales is 500 tickets * $20/ticket = $10000.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tom made is $10000 (money from ticket sales) - $1202 (total expenses) = $8798.

To determine how much money Tom makes, we need to calculate all his expenses and then subtract them from his total revenue.

First, we calculate the cost of the flour:
- Tom needs 500 pounds of flour.
- He can buy 50-pound bags of flour for $20 each.

The number of bags needed is:
\[ \frac{500 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds per bag}} = 10 \text{ bags} \]

The total cost for the flour is:
\[ 10 \text{ bags} \times \$20 \text{ per bag} = \$200 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the salt:
- Tom needs 10 pounds of salt.
- The cost of salt is \$0.2 per pound.

The total cost for the salt is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.2 \text{ per pound} = \$2 \]

Additionally, Tom spends $1000 promoting everything.

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ \$200 \text{ (flour)} + \$2 \text{ (salt)} + \$1000 \text{ (promoting)} = \$1002 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling tickets. The ticket price is $20 each and he sells 500 tickets:
\[ 500 \text{ tickets} \times \$20 \text{ per ticket} = \$10,000 \]

To find out how much money Tom makes, we subtract the total expenses from the total revenue:
\[ \$10,000 \text{ (revenue)} - \$1002 \text{ (expenses)} = \$8998 \]

So, Tom makes \$8998.

First, let's calculate the cost of the flour. Tom needs 500 pounds of flour and each 50-pound bag costs $20. Therefore, the total cost for flour is 500/50 * $20 = $200. 

Next, let's calculate the cost of the salt. Tom needs 10 pounds of salt, and it costs $0.2 per pound, so the total cost for salt is 10 * $0.2 = $2. 

Additionally, Tom spends $1000 promoting everything.

Now, let's sum up all the costs:
- Flour: $200
- Salt: $2
- Promotion: $1000

Total cost = $200 + $2 + $1000 = $1202.

Next, we calculate the revenue from ticket sales. Tom sells 500 tickets at $20 each, so the total revenue is 500 * $20 = $10000.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $10000 - $1202 = $8798.

So, Tom makes a profit of $8798.

First, we will calculate the total amount of flour Tom needs. He requires 500 pounds of flour. Since each bag of flour weighs 50 pounds, he needs 500/50 = 10 bags of flour. Each bag costs $20, so the flour costs 10 * $20 = $200. 

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of the salt. He requires 10 pounds of salt, with salt costing $0.2 per pound, meaning the salt costs 10 * $0.2 = $2. 

Furthermore, he spent $1000 on promotion.

In total, the costs come to $200 (flour) + $2 (salt) + $1000 (promotion) = $1202.

He then sells 500 tickets at $20 each, generating $20 * 500 = $10000. 

Thus, the total profit is the tickets revenue minus the total costs, which is $10000 - $1202 = $8798.

First, we need to determine how much flour Tom will need to buy. To do this, we divide the total amount of flour needed by the weight of each bag of flour: 500 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 10 bags of flour.

Next, we calculate the cost of the flour by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag: 10 bags * $20 per bag = $200.

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the salt. The cost is $0.2 per pound, so we multiply the number of pounds by the cost per pound: 10 pounds * $0.2 per pound = $2.

The promotion costs him $1000.

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total cost of making the dough ball:
Flour: $200
Salt: $2
Promotion: $1000
Total cost: $200 + $2 + $1000 = $1202

Then, we calculate the revenue from selling tickets. We multiply the number of tickets sold by the price per ticket: 500 tickets * $20 per ticket = $10,000.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the revenue to find Tom's profit: $10,000 revenue - $1202 total cost = $8,798 profit.

Next, we calculate the cost of the salt. He needs 10 pounds of salt, and it costs $.2 a pound, so the cost is 10 * $.2 = $2.

The promotion cost is a fixed $1000.

Adding up all the costs, the total cost is the sum of the flour cost, the salt cost, and the promotion cost: $200 + $2 + $1000 = $1202.

Tom sells tickets for $20 each and sells 500 tickets, so the total revenue from ticket sales is 500 * $20 = $10000.
