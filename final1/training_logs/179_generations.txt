Colton gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) stickers. Then he gave Mandy 2 more than he gave his three friends total, which is \(12 + 2 = 14\) stickers. Finally, he gave Justin 10 less than Mandy, which is \(14 - 10 = 4\) stickers.

Therefore, Colton has given away a total of \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) stickers. Since Colton originally had 72 stickers, the number of stickers he has left is \(72 - 30 = 42\) stickers.

Colton gave 4 stickers per friend for 3 friends, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) stickers. Then, given 2 more than this for Mandy, it is \(12 + 2 =14\) stickers. Lastly, for Justin, it is \(14 - 10 = 4\) stickers. Adding these 4 stickers for Justin with the \(72\) stickers he originally had, he has \(72 + 4 = 76\) stickers in total. Subtracting the 38 given stickers, he has \(76 - 38 = 38\) stickers left.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####

system
Before he gave any stickers away, Colton had 72 dolphin stickers. He gave away 4 stickers each to 3 friends, which means he gave away a total of \(4 \times 3 = 12\) stickers to his friends. Let's calculate the number of stickers he gave to Mandy. Mandy received 2 more stickers than he gave his three friends in total, so she received \(12 + 2 = 14\) stickers. Lastly, Colton gave Justin 10 less than he gave Mandy, so he gave Justin \(14 - 10 = 4\) stickers. To determine how many stickers Colton has left, we calculate the total number of stickers he gave away and subtract it from his initial total: \(12 \, (to \, friends) + 14 \, (to \, Mandy) + 4 \, (to \, Justin) = 30\) stickers. Subtracting the total number of stickers given away from the initial total, we get \(72 - 30 = 42\) stickers.
