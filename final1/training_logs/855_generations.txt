<reasoning>
The factory manufactures 300 gummy bears per minute. Each packet contains 50 gummy bears. Therefore, to fill one packet, the factory needs \( \frac{300}{50} = 6 \) minutes.

To fill 240 packets, the factory would need \( 240 \times 6 = 1440 \) minutes.

So, it would take the factory 1440 minutes to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the gummy bear factory to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets.

First, let's calculate the total number of gummy bears required to fill 240 packets. Since each packet contains 50 gummy bears, the total number of gummy bears needed is:
\[ 240 \text{ packets} \times 50 \text{ gummy bears/packet} = 12000 \text{ gummy bears} \]

Next, we know the factory manufactures 300 gummy bears per minute. To find out how long it takes to manufacture 12000 gummy bears, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total number of gummy bears}}{\text{Gummy bears per minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{12000}{300} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it would take 40 minutes for the factory to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets.

To determine how long it takes to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets, we first calculate the total number of gummy bears needed. Since each packet contains 50 gummy bears, for 240 packets, we need:

\[ 240 \times 50 = 12000 \text{ gummy bears} \]

Next, we know that the factory manufactures 300 gummy bears per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes to manufacture 12000 gummy bears, we divide the total number of gummy bears by the rate of production:

\[ \frac{12000}{300} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it would take 40 minutes for the factory to manufacture and fill 240 packets of gummy bears.

The factory manufactures 300 gummy bears per minute. Each packet contains 50 gummy bears. Therefore, the factory needs to manufacture \( \frac{300}{50} = 6 \) packets of gummy bears per minute to fill one packet.

To fill 240 packets, the factory would need to manufacture \( 240 \times 6 = 1440 \) packets of gummy bears per minute.

To find out how long it would take to manufacture 1440 packets, we divide the total number of packets by the rate at which the factory manufactures packets: \( \frac{1440}{300} = 4.8 \) minutes.

Therefore, it would take 4.8 minutes to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets.

The factory manufactures 300 gummy bears per minute. Each packet contains 50 gummy bears. To find out how many gummy bears are needed to fill 240 packets, we multiply the number of packets by the number of gummy bears per packet:

\[ 240 \text{ packets} \times 50 \text{ gummy bears/packet} = 12000 \text{ gummy bears} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take for the factory to manufacture 12000 gummy bears at a rate of 300 gummy bears per minute. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of gummy bears needed by the rate of production:

\[ \frac{12000 \text{ gummy bears}}{300 \text{ gummy bears/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it would take 40 minutes for the factory to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets.

The factory manufactures 300 gummy bears per minute.
Each packet contains 50 gummy bears.
To fill one packet, the factory needs 300 gummy bears (since 300 / 50 = 6).
The factory needs to fill 240 packets, so it needs 240 * 300 = 72000 gummy bears.
At a rate of 300 gummy bears per minute, it would take 72000 / 300 = 240 minutes.

First, we need to determine the total number of gummy bears required to fill 240 packets. Since each packet contains 50 gummy bears, the total number of gummy bears needed is \( 240 \times 50 \). Next, we need to calculate how long it will take to manufacture these gummy bears at a rate of 300 gummy bears per minute. To find the time required, we divide the total number of gummy bears by the production rate.

Let's do the calculation:
\[
240 \text{ packets} \times 50 \text{ gummy bears/packet} = 12000 \text{ gummy bears}
\]
\[
\frac{12000 \text{ gummy bears}}{300 \text{ gummy bears/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, let's verify the arithmetic:
\[
\frac{12000}{300} = 40
\]

Therefore, the factory takes 40 minutes to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets.

To determine how long it would take for the factory to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gummy bears needed to fill 240 packets.
2. Determine how long it takes to manufacture those gummy bears given the factory's production rate.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of gummy bears needed.
Each packet contains 50 gummy bears, and there are 240 packets.
\[ \text{Total gummy bears} = 240 \text{ packets} \times 50 \text{ gummy bears/packet} = 12000 \text{ gummy bears} \]

Step 2: Determine how long it takes to manufacture 12000 gummy bears.
The factory manufactures 300 gummy bears per minute.
\[ \text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{12000 \text{ gummy bears}}{300 \text{ gummy bears/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take 40 minutes for the factory to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets.
