To find the volume of the box, we first need to determine the length and width of the box, given the height and the relationships between them.

1. The height of the box is given as 12 inches.
2. The length of the box is 3 times its height, so:
   \[
   \text{Length} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. The length of the box is also 4 times its width, so:
   \[
   \text{Length} = 4 \times \text{Width}
   \]
   From the previous step, we know the length is 36 inches, so:
   \[
   36 = 4 \times \text{Width}
   \]
   Solving for the width:
   \[
   \text{Width} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now we have all dimensions of the box: height = 12 inches, length = 36 inches, and width = 9 inches.

Next, we calculate the volume of the box using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
   \]
   Substituting the known dimensions:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 36 \times 9 \times 12
   \]
   First, calculate \( 36 \times 9 \):
   \[
   36 \times 9 = 324
   \]
   Then, multiply by 12:
   \[
   324 \times 12 = 3888
   \]

Therefore, the volume of the box is 3888 cubic inches.

To find the volume of the box, we need to first determine the length and width of the box.

Given:
- Height (h) = 12 inches
- Length (l) = 3 times height = 3 * 12 = 36 inches
- Width (w) = Length / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9 inches

Now, the volume (V) of the box can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = l \times w \times h \]

Substituting the values we found:
\[ V = 36 \times 9 \times 12 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ V = 36 \times 108 = 3888 \]

So, the volume of the box is 3888 cubic inches.

To determine the volume of the box, we need to find the length, width, and height first, and then use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: \( \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \).

Given:
- Height (h) = 12 inches
- Length (l) = 3 times height, so \( l = 3 \times 12 = 36 \) inches
- Length (l) = 4 times width, so \( \text{width (w)} = \frac{l}{4} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \) inches

Now, we can calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = l \times w \times h = 36 \times 9 \times 12 \]

Let's calculate the product:
\[ 36 \times 9 = 324 \]
\[ 324 \times 12 = 3888 \]

So, the volume of the box is 3888 cubic inches.

To find the volume of the box, we need to calculate the length, width, and height first. Given that the height is 12 inches, we can find the length and width using the given relationships.

The length is 3 times the height:
\[ \text{Length} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ inches} \]

The length is also 4 times the width, so we can find the width by dividing the length by 4:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Length}}{4} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \text{ inches} \]

Now that we have all three dimensions (12 inches height, 36 inches length, and 9 inches width), we can calculate the volume by multiplying these three dimensions together:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Height} \times \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 12 \times 36 \times 9 \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Volume} = 432 \times 9 = 3888 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the box is 3888 cubic inches.

To find the volume of Justin's box, we need to determine its dimensions: length, width, and height. We are given the height, which is 12 inches. The length is 3 times the height, so the length is 3 * 12 = 36 inches. The length is also 4 times the width, so we can set up an equation where the length is also 4 times the width to find the width. Therefore, width = length / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9 inches.

With all three dimensions known, we can now calculate the volume of the box. Volume is calculated by multiplying length, width, and height, so Volume = 36 * 9 * 12.

Let's do the math to find out the volume.

1. Height (h) = 12 inches
2. Length (l) = 3 * Height = 3 * 12 = 36 inches
3. Length (l) = 4 * Width (w), so Width (w) = Length / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9 inches

Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the volume of the box using the formula:
Volume = Length * Width * Height

Volume = 36 inches * 9 inches * 12 inches

Volume = 3888 cubic inches

To find the volume of the box, we first need to determine its length and width using the given relationships.

1. We know the height is 12 inches.
2. The length is 3 times the height, so:
\[ \text{Length} = 3 \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 12 \]
3. The length is also 4 times the width, so:
\[ \text{Length} = 4 \times \text{Width} \]

From this, we can express the width in terms of the length:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Length}}{4} \]

4. We can now solve for the length using the fact that the length is the same in both expressions:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 4 \times \text{Length} \]
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{3 \times 12}{4} \]
\[ \text{Length} = 3 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Length} = 9 \, \text{inches} \]

5. With the length being 9 inches, we can find the width:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{9}{4} \]
\[ \text{Width} = 2.25 \, \text{inches} \]

6. Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 9 \times 2.25 \times 12 \]

We can simplify the calculation:
\[ \text{Volume} = 9 \times 27 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 243 \]

Therefore, the volume of the box is 243 cubic inches.

To find the volume of the box, we need to calculate the dimensions of the box first. Let's denote the width as \( w \).

1. The height of the box is given as 12 inches.
2. The length of the box is 3 times its height, so the length is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) inches.
3. The length is also 4 times the width, so \( 4w = 36 \). Solving for \( w \), we divide both sides by 4 to get \( w = 9 \) inches.

Now we have all three dimensions: height \( = 12 \) inches, length \( = 36 \) inches, and width \( = 9 \) inches. The volume \( V \) of a box is calculated by multiplying these three dimensions together:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ V = 36 \times 9 \times 12 \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ V = 36 \times 108 \]

Multiplying these together gives us:
\[ V = 3888 \]

Therefore, the volume of the box is \( 3888 \) cubic inches.

Let's denote the width of the box as \( w \).

Given that the height of the box is 12 inches, the length is 3 times its height, so the length is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) inches.

The length is also given as 4 times the width, so \( 36 = 4w \). Solving for \( w \), we get \( w = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \) inches.

The volume \( V \) of a box is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. So, the volume is \( V = 36 \times 9 \times 12 \).

To calculate this, we first multiply 36 and 12, which gives \( 36 \times 12 = 432 \). Then we multiply this result by 9, which gives \( 432 \times 9 = 3888 \).

Therefore, the volume of the box is 3888 cubic inches.

First, we calculate the length and width of the box using the given relationships. The length \( L \) is 3 times the height \( H \), and the width \( W \) is 4 times the height \( H \).

Given:
- Height \( H = 12 \) inches

Calculate the length:
\[ L = 3 \times H = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ inches} \]

Calculate the width:
\[ W = 4 \times H = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches} \]

The volume \( V \) of a box is given by the formula \( V = L \times W \times H \).

Substitute the height, length, and width:
\[ V = 36 \times 48 \times 12 \]

Solve for the volume:
\[ V = 36 \times 48 \times 12 \]
\[ V = 1728 \times 12 \]
\[ V = 20736 \]

To find the volume of the box, we need to determine its length, width, and height. Given that the height is 12 inches, we can calculate the length by multiplying the height by 3 (since the length is 3 times the height), and the width by dividing the length by 4 (since the width is 1/4 of the length).

Length = Height * 3 = 12 inches * 3 = 36 inches
Width = Length / 4 = 36 inches / 4 = 9 inches

Now that we know the length (36 inches), width (9 inches), and height (12 inches), we can calculate the volume of the box using the formula:

To find the volume of the box, we need to determine its length, width, and height, knowing the relationships between them and the given dimensions.

We know that:
- Height, \( h = 12 \) inches.
- Length is 3 times the height: \( l = 3 \times 12 = 36 \) inches.
- Length is also 4 times the width: \( l = 4 \times \text{width} \).

Using the relationship between length, height, and width, we can solve for the width:
\[ 36 = 4 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \] inches.

Now that we have the dimensions:
- Height: \( 12 \) inches
- Length: \( 36 \) inches
- Width: \( 9 \) inches

The volume of a box is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height:
\[ V = l \times w \times h = 36 \times 9 \times 12 \]

Calculating this product:
\[ V = 36 \times 108 = 3888 \] cubic inches.

Let's denote the width of the box as \( w \) inches. According to the problem, the height \( h \) of the box is 12 inches and the length \( l \) is 3 times the height or \( l = 3 \times 12 = 36 \) inches. The problem also states that the length is 4 times the width, so \( l = 4 \times w \). We can set up the equation \( 36 = 4 \times w \) and solve for \( w \):

\[
w = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \text{ inches}
\]

Now that we have the width, we can calculate the volume \( V \) of the box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism \( V = l \times w \times h \):

\[
V = 36 \times 9 \times 12 = 3888 \text{ cubic inches}
