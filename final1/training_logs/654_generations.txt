system
To calculate the price after the discount for each store, we use the formula: price after discount = original price - (original price * discount rate).

For the first store:
Price after discount = $950 - ($950 * 6%) = $950 - $57 = $893

For the second store:
Price after discount = €920 - (€920 * 5%) = €920 - €46 = €874

Now, we calculate the difference between the two prices.
Difference in price = Price after discount in the first store - Price after discount in the second store
Difference in price = $893 - €874

Since the prices are in different currencies, let's convert them to a common unit, like the US dollar, to make the subtraction easier.  
Given that €1 = $1.10 (using an approximate exchange rate for this calculation), we convert:
€874 * $1.10 = $961.40

Now, calculate the difference:
Difference in price = $893 - $961.40 = -$68.40

The result is negative, indicating the first store is cheaper.

To find the difference in price between the two stores, we need to calculate the final cost for each store after applying the discount.

For the first store:
- Original price of the computer: $950
- Discount: 6%
- Discount amount: 6% of $950 = 0.06 * $950 = $57
- Final price at the first store: $950 - $57 = $893

For the second store:
- Original price of the computer: €920
- Discount: 5%
- Discount amount: 5% of €920 = 0.05 * €920 = €46
- Final price at the second store: €920 - €46 = €874

Now, let's calculate the difference in price between the two stores:
- Difference: €874 - €893 = -€19

Since the final price at the second store is lower, the difference in price is -$19, which means the first store is cheaper by $19.

To determine the difference in price between the two stores, we need to calculate the final price of the computer in each store after applying the respective discounts.

**Store 1:**
- Original price: $950
- Discount: 6%

The amount of the discount is:
\[ 0.06 \times 950 = 57 \]

The final price after discount is:
\[ 950 - 57 = 893 \]

**Store 2:**
- Original price: €920
- Discount: 5%

The amount of the discount is:
\[ 0.05 \times 920 = 46 \]

The final price after discount is:
\[ 920 - 46 = 874 \]

Now, to find the difference in price between the two stores, we subtract the final price in Store 2 from the final price in Store 1:
\[ 893 - 874 = 19 \]

Therefore, the difference in price between the two stores is $19.

To find the difference in price between the two stores, we first need to calculate the discounted prices for each store.

For the first store:
Initial price = $950
Discount percentage = 6%

Discount amount = Initial price * Discount percentage
                  = $950 * 0.06
                  = $57

Discounted price = Initial price - Discount amount
                 = $950 - $57
                 = $893

For the second store:
Initial price = €920
Discount percentage = 5%

Discount amount = Initial price * Discount percentage
                = €920 * 0.05
                = €46

Discounted price = Initial price - Discount amount
                 = €920 - €46
                 = €874

Now, to find the difference in price between the two stores:
Difference in price = Discounted price of first store - Discounted price of second store
                   = $893 - €874
                   = $19

The difference in price between the two stores is $19.

To determine the difference in price between the two stores, we need to calculate the final price of the computer at each store after applying the discount.

For the first store:
Original price = $950
Discount percentage = 6%

Calculating the discount amount:
Discount amount = 6% of $950
                = 0.06 * $950
                = $57

Calculating the final price after discount:
Final price = Original price - Discount amount
           = $950 - $57
           = $893

For the second store:
Original price = €920
Discount percentage = 5%

Calculating the discount amount:
Discount amount = 5% of €920
                = 0.05 * €920
                = €46

Calculating the final price after discount:
Final price = Original price - Discount amount
           = €920 - €46
           = €874

Now, we calculate the difference in price between the two stores:
Difference = Final price at first store - Final price at second store
           = $893 - €874 (converting to the same currency for comparison)
           = $0.39 (approximately, considering the difference in currency conversions)

Therefore, the difference in price between the two stores is approximately $0.39.

Subtract the discount from the original price:

\[ \$950 - \$57 = \$893 \]

The price at the first store is \$893.

For the second store, we calculate 5% of €920 and subtract it from the original price:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } €920 = 0.05 \times €920 = €46 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price:

Let's calculate the discounted price for each store.

For the first store:
- Original price: $950
- Discount: 6%
- Discount amount: \( 950 \times 0.06 = 57 \) dollars
- Discounted price: \( 950 - 57 = 893 \) dollars

For the second store:
- Original price: €920
- Discount: 5%
- Discount amount: \( 920 \times 0.05 = 46 \) euros
- Discounted price: \( 920 - 46 = 874 \) euros

Now, let's convert the price from euros to dollars to compare it with the first store's price (since they are both in the same currency for this calculation).
- 1 euro ≈ $1.14 (using an approximate conversion rate)
- 874 euros ≈ \( 874 \times 1.14 = 998.36 \) dollars

Now we can find the difference in price between the two stores:

- Difference in price: \( 998.36 - 893 = 105.36 \) dollars

The difference in price between the two stores is 105.36 dollars.

To find the difference in price between the two stores, we need to calculate the actual prices after the discount for each store and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the price after the discount at the first store:
Original price = $950
Discount rate = 6%

Discount amount = $950 * 6% = $950 * 0.06 = $57

Price after discount = Original price - Discount amount
Price after discount = $950 - $57 = $893

Now, let's calculate the price after the discount at the second store:
Original price = €920
Discount rate = 5%

Discount amount = €920 * 5% = €920 * 0.05 = €46

Price after discount = Original price - Discount amount
Price after discount = €920 - €46 = €874

Now we find the difference in price between the two stores:

To compare the prices of the computers from the two stores, we'll first convert the price from the first store into euros to make a fair comparison.

The original price of the computer is $950. The store offers a 6% discount, so the discounted price in dollars is:
\[ 950 \times (1 - 0.06) = 900 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we convert $900 into euros using the conversion rate of 1 USD = 0.934 euros (this is an approximation based on exchange rates as of January 2023). Thus, the price in euros is:
\[ 900 \text{ dollars} \times 0.934 \text{ euros/dollar} = 840.6 \text{ euros} \]

Now, we can compare the discounted price in euros:
- First store: €840.6
- Second store: €920

The difference in price between the two stores is:
\[ 920 - 840.6 = 79.4 \text{ euros} \]

The discount on the computer in the second store is 5%, so the price Sara will pay in euros is:
\[ 920 \times (1 - 0.05) = 920 \times 0.95 = 874 \text{ euros} \]
The difference in price is:
\[ 920 - 874 = 46 \text{ euros} \]

Therefore, the difference in price between the two stores is €79.4. However, the second store actually has a lower price. So, the difference in price between the two stores is:
\[ 920 - 840.6 = 79.4 \text{ euros} \]

The answer is the absolute difference in price, which is €79.4.
