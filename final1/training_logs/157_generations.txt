###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A young girl pours 23 blue beads and 16 yellow beads into a bowl. She divides the total into 3 equal parts, removes some beads from each part, and doubles the rest to have 6 beads in each part now. How many beads were removed from each part?

The total number of beads is 23 + 16 = 39. When divided into 3 equal parts, each part contains 39/3 = 13 beads. If she doubles the rest to have 6 beads in each part, then 13 - 6 = 7 beads were removed from each part.

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####


system
Initially, the total number of beads is \(23 + 16 = 39\). When the beads are divided into 3 equal parts, each part contains \(39 / 3 = 13\) beads. The young girl doubles the remaining beads in each part to have 6 beads in each part now. This means that before doubling, the number of beads remaining in each part was \((6 - 13) / 2 = -\frac{7}{2}\), which is not possible since the number of beads cannot be negative. This indicates that we need to solve the equation before doubling correctly, which is to consider that after doubling the remaining beads, the number of beads in each part becomes 6. This implies that before doubling, there were \(6 - 13 / 2 = 6 - 6.5 = -0.5\), which again is not possible. However, the correct interpretation should be that after doubling, the remaining beads in each part are 6, so before doubling, the beads in each part had to be \(6 \times 2 = 12\) (before doubling, before accounting for the beads removed).

So, the initial number of beads in each part before removing any was 13 (the total was divided into 3 equal parts), and after removing some beads, the remaining beads were 12. Therefore, the beads removed from each part is \(13 - 12 = 1\).

The girl initially has 23 blue beads and 16 yellow beads, making a total of \(23 + 16 = 39\) beads.

She divides the total into 3 equal parts, so each part initially contains \(39 \div 3 = 13\) beads.

After removing some beads, she doubles the remaining beads to have 6 beads in each part.

Let \(x\) be the number of beads removed from each part. Then the remaining beads are \(13 - x\), and when doubled, they become 6:

\[
2(13 - x) = 6
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
26 - 2x = 6 \\
26 - 6 = 2x \\
20 = 2x \\
x = 10
\]

So, \(10\) beads were removed from each part.

Let's first find the total number of beads. Blue beads + Yellow beads = Total beads.

Total beads = 23 (blue) + 16 (yellow) = 39 beads.

Dividing the total beads into 3 equal parts gives us:

Each part = Total beads / 3 = 39 beads / 3 = 13 beads per part.

So, initially, each part has 13 beads.

Now, they double each part to have 6 beads in each part:

Initially, 13 beads were in each part.

If they double to have 6 beads in each part, the beads removed from each part before doubling was:

Removed beads  = Initially in each part - Doubled beads in each part
Removed beads = 13 beads per part - 6 beads per part
Removed beads = 7 beads per part.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####

system
The girl initially has a total of \(23 + 16 = 39\) beads. She divides these beads into 3 equal parts, so each part initially contains \(39 / 3 = 13\) beads.

Let's denote the number of beads removed from each part as \(r\). After removing \(r\) beads from each part, the number of beads left in each part is \(13 - r\). According to the problem, she then doubles the remaining beads in each part, resulting in \(2(13 - r) = 6\).

We can solve this equation to find \(r\):
\[
2(13 - r) = 6 \\
13 - r = \frac{6}{2} \\
13 - r = 3 \\
r = 13 - 3 \\
r = 10
\]

Therefore, the answer is 10.

The young girl initially has a total of 23 + 16 = 39 beads.

She divides these into 3 equal parts: 39 ÷ 3 = 13 beads per part.

After removing some beads, she doubles the remaining beads to have 6 beads in each part now.

Let's denote the number of beads removed from each part as \( x \).

After removing \( x \) beads from each part, she has 13 - \( x \) beads left in each part, which she doubles to 6 beads:
\[ 2 \times (13 - x) = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 13 - x = 3 \]
\[ x = 13 - 3 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, \( \boxed{10} \) beads were removed from each part.

Let's break it down:

1. First, the total number of beads is 23 (blue) + 16 (yellow) = 39 beads.
2. The total number of parts is divided into 3, so each part initially contains 39 ÷ 3 = 13 beads.
3. When the girl doubles the rest of the beads, she ends up with 6 beads in each part.
4. This means the total number of beads lost from each part initially was 13 - 6 = 7 beads.

Therefore, 7 beads were removed from each part.

The total number of beads poured into the bowl is 23 + 16 = 39 beads. Dividing this into 3 equal parts gives 39 ÷ 3 = 13 beads per part.

Removing some beads from each part leaves 13 - x beads where x is the number of beads removed from each part.

Doubling the rest after removing x beads results in 2(13 - x) = 6.

Solving the equation 2(13 - x) = 6 for x:

26 - 2x = 6,
2x = 26 - 6,
2x = 20,
x = 20/2,
x = 10.

So, 10 beads were removed from each part.

The young girl pours a total of 23 + 16 = 39 beads. Dividing these into 3 equal parts means each part initially contains 39 / 3 = 13 beads.

Removing beads then means subtracting an unknown number, x, from each part, leaving (13 - x) beads in each part. According to the problem, these remaining beads are doubled to give 6 in each part now. Hence, we can set up the equation:

2(13 - x) = 6

Solving this equation:

26 - 2x = 6
26 - 6 = 2x
20 = 2x
x = 10

Therefore, 10 beads were removed from each part.
