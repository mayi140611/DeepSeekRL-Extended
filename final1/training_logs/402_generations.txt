To find the average age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette, we need to first find their individual ages based on the information given.

1. Kimiko's age is given as 28 years.
2. Omi is twice as old as Kimiko, so Omi's age = 2 * Kimiko's age = 2 * 28 = 56 years.
3. Arlette is \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as old as Kimiko, so Arlette's age = \( \frac{3}{4} \) * Kimiko's age = \( \frac{3}{4} \) * 28 = 21 years.

Now, we calculate the average age of these three individuals:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Omi's age} + \text{Kimiko's age} + \text{Arlette's age}}{3} = \frac{56 + 28 + 21}{3} = \frac{105}{3} = 35
\]

To determine the average age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette, we first need to calculate their individual ages based on the given information.

1. Kimiko's age is given as 28 years.
2. Omi is twice as old as Kimiko, so Omi's age is:
   \[
   2 \times 28 = 56 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Arlette is \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as old as Kimiko, so Arlette's age is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 28 = 56 \times \frac{3}{4} = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we sum the ages of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette:
\[
56 + 28 + 42 = 126 \text{ years}
\]

To find the average age, we divide the total age by the number of individuals (which is 3):
\[
\frac{126}{3} = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, the average age of the three is \(\boxed{42}\).

To find the average age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette, we first need to determine their individual ages based on the given information.

1. Kimiko's age is given as 28 years.
2. Omi is twice as old as Kimiko, so:
   Omi's age = 2 * Kimiko's age = 2 * 28 = 56 years
3. Arlette is \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as old as Kimiko, so:
   Arlette's age = \(\frac{3}{4}\) * Kimiko's age = \(\frac{3}{4}\) * 28 = 21 years

Now that we have the ages of all three, we can calculate the average age:

Average age = \(\frac{Omi's age + Kimiko's age + Arlette's age}{3}\)

Let's calculate it:

Average age = \(\frac{56 + 28 + 21}{3}\)

Let's solve this using reasoning.
<answer>
Average age = \(\frac{56 + 28 + 21}{3} = \frac{105}{3} = 35\)

The average age of the three is 35 years.

</answer>
<reasoning>
First, we calculated Omi's age as 28 (twice Kimiko's age) and Arlette's age as 21 (3/4 times Kimiko's age). Then we added these three ages together and divided by 3 (to find the average), which gave us the result of 35.

To find the average age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette, we first need to calculate each of their ages based on the given relationships and Kimiko's age.

1. Since Kimiko is 28 years old:
   - Omi's age = 2 * Kimiko's age = 2 * 28 = 56 years old

2. Arlette's age = 3/4 times Kimiko's age = 3/4 * 28 = 21 years old

3. Now, we calculate the average age:
   - Average age = (Omi's age + Kimiko's age + Arlette's age) / 3
   - Average age = (56 + 28 + 21) / 3
   - Average age = 105 / 3
   - Average age = 35

Let's denote Kimiko's age as \( K \), Omi's age as \( O \), and Arlette's age as \( A \).

Given:
- Kimiko's age \( K = 28 \) years
- Omi's age \( O \) is twice Kimiko's age, so \( O = 2K \)
- Arlette's age \( A \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \) times Kimiko's age, so \( A = \frac{3}{4}K \)

First, we calculate Omi's and Arlette's ages:
\[
O = 2K = 2 \times 28 = 56 \text{ years}
\]
\[
A = \frac{3}{4}K = \frac{3}{4} \times 28 = 21 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we find the average age of the three:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{K + O + A}{3} = \frac{28 + 56 + 21}{3}
\]

Calculating the sum of the ages:
\[
28 + 56 + 21 = 105
\]

Then, the average age is:
\[
\frac{105}{3} = 35 \text{ years}
\]

So, the average age of the three is **35** years.

To find the average age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette, we need to determine their individual ages and then calculate the average.

1. Kimiko's age is given as 28 years.

2. Omi is twice as old as Kimiko:

   \]

4. To find the average age, we sum the ages of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette and divide by 3:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Omi's age} + \text{Kimiko's age} + \text{Arlette's age}}{3} = \frac{56 + 28 + 21}{3}

To calculate the average age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette, we first need to determine the ages of Omi and Arlette based on the given relationships and Kimiko's age.

1. **Kimiko's age**: Kimiko is given as 28 years old.
2. **Omi's age**: Omi is twice as old as Kimiko. Therefore, Omi's age is \(2 \times 28 = 56\) years old.
3. **Arlette's age**: Arlette is \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as old as Kimiko. Therefore, Arlette's age is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 28 = 21\) years old.

4. **Calculate the average age**: The average age is the sum of their ages divided by the number of people.

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Omi's age} + \text{Kimiko's age} + \text{Arlette's age}}{3} = \frac{56 + 28 + 21}{3} = \frac{105}{3} = 35
