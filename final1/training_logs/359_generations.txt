Rene can finish reading 30 pages in 60 minutes. Lulu can read 27 pages in 60 minutes and Cherry can read 25 pages in 60 minutes. If they have been reading for 240 minutes now, how many pages have they finished reading in total?

To determine the total number of pages read by Rene, Lulu, and Cherry, we first need to calculate how many pages each can read in 240 minutes.

Rene's reading rate is 30 pages in 60 minutes, so in 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ pages} \]

Lulu's reading rate is 27 pages in 60 minutes, so in 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ pages} \]

Cherry's reading rate is 25 pages in 60 minutes, so in 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we sum the pages read by all three:
\[ 10 \text{ pages} + 108 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 218 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages they have read in 240 minutes is:

Reasoning:
First, calculate how many pages each person can read in 240 minutes. Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes, so in 240 minutes, he would read \(240 \times \frac{30}{60} = 120\) pages. Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes, so in 240 minutes, she would read \(240 \times \frac{27}{60} = 108\) pages. Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes, so in 240 minutes, she would read \(240 \times \frac{25}{60} = 100\) pages. Now add up the total pages read by all three:
\(120 + 108 + 100 = 328\) pages in total.

Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes, so in 240 minutes, he would read \( \frac{240}{60} \times 30 \) pages.
Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes, so in 240 minutes, she would read \( \frac{240}{60} \times 27 \) pages.
Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes, so in 240 minutes, she would read \( \frac{240}{60} \times 25 \) pages.
To find the total number of pages they have read, we add the pages each has read.

To find out how many pages they have finished reading in total, we need to calculate how many pages each person can read in 240 minutes and then sum those amounts.

For Rene, in 60 minutes he can read 30 pages. Therefore, in 240 minutes he can read:
\( \frac{30 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 10 \times 24 = 240 \text{ pages} \)

For Lulu, in 60 minutes she can read 27 pages. Therefore, in 240 minutes she can read:
\( \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 0.45 \times 240 = 108 \text{ pages} \)

For Cherry, in 60 minutes she can read 25 pages. Therefore, in 240 minutes she can read:
\( \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = \frac{25}{60} \times 240 = \frac{25}{60} \times \frac{240}{1} = \frac{25 \times 240}{60} = \frac{25 \times 4}{1} = 100 \text{ pages} \)

Now, let's sum the pages they have finished:
\( 240 \text{ (Rene)} + 108 \text{ (Lulu)} + 100 \text{ (Cherry)} = 448 \text{ pages} \)

Therefore, the total number of pages they have finished reading in 240 minutes is 448 pages.

To determine the total number of pages read by Rene, Lulu, and Cherry, we need to calculate the number of pages each person reads in 240 minutes and then sum these amounts.

First, let's find out how many pages Rene reads in 240 minutes:
Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, in 240 minutes, which is 4 times 60 minutes, he reads:
\[ 30 \text{ pages/60 minutes} \times 4 = 120 \text{ pages} \]

Next, let's find out how many pages Lulu reads in 240 minutes:
Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, in 240 minutes, which is 4 times 60 minutes, she reads:
\[ 27 \text{ pages/60 minutes} \times 4 = 108 \text{ pages} \]

Finally, let's find out how many pages Cherry reads in 240 minutes:
Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, in 240 minutes, which is 4 times 60 minutes, she reads:
\[ 25 \text{ pages/60 minutes} \times 4 = 100 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we sum the pages read by all three:
\[ 120 \text{ pages} + 108 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 328 \text{ pages} \]

So, they have finished reading a total of 328 pages.

To determine how many pages they have finished reading in total, we first need to calculate how many pages each person has read in 240 minutes.

Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, in 240 minutes, Rene will read:

\[ \frac{240}{60} \times 30 = 4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ pages} \]

Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, in 240 minutes, Lulu will read:

\[ \frac{240}{60} \times 27 = 4 \times 27 = 108 \text{ pages} \]

Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, in 240 minutes, Cherry will read:

\[ \frac{240}{60} \times 25 = 4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we sum the pages read by all three:

\[ 120 + 108 + 100 = 328 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages they have finished reading in 240 minutes is \(328\).

To calculate the total pages read, we first find out how much Rene, Lulu, and Cherry read in 1 minute.

Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes, so he reads \( \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \) pages per minute.
Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes, so she reads \( \frac{27}{60} = 0.45 \) pages per minute.
Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes, so she reads \( \frac{25}{60} \approx 0.417 \) pages per minute.

Now, we calculate the total pages read in 240 minutes:

- Rene reads \( 0.5 \times 240 = 120 \) pages.
- Lulu reads \( 0.45 \times 240 \approx 108 \) pages.
- Cherry reads \( 0.417 \times 240 \approx 100.08 \) pages.

Adding it all up: \( 120 + 108 + 100.08 = 328.08 \) pages.

However, usually we round to the nearest whole number for page counts, so they would have read approximately 328 pages in 240 minutes.

Lulu reads 27 pages / 60 minutes = 0.45 pages per minute.
Cherry reads 25 pages / 60 minutes = 0.416667 pages per minute.

Next, we calculate how many pages each person has read in 240 minutes:

Rene reads 0.5 pages/minute * 240 minutes = 120 pages.
Lulu reads 0.45 pages/minute * 240 minutes = 108 pages.
Cherry reads 0.416667 pages/minute * 240 minutes = 100 pages.

First, let's calculate the reading speed of each person in terms of pages per minute:

- Lulu's reading speed: \( \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.45 \text{ pages/minute} \)
- Cherry's reading speed: \( \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4167 \text{ pages/minute} \) (rounded to four decimal places)

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages each person has read after 240 minutes:

- Rene's total pages: \( 0.5 \text{ pages/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ pages} \)
- Lulu's total pages: \( 0.45 \text{ pages/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ pages} \)
- Cherry's total pages: \( 0.4167 \text{ pages/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ pages} \) (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, let's sum up the total pages read by all three:

Total pages = Rene's total pages + Lulu's total pages + Cherry's total pages
Total pages = 120 + 108 + 100
Total pages = 328

Therefore, in total, they have read 328 pages.

To find out how many pages Rene, Lulu, and Cherry have finished reading in total, we first need to determine how many pages each person reads per minute and then calculate the total pages they have read in 240 minutes.
