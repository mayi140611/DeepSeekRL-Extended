system
To find out on average how much each book Fred bought cost, we first need to determine the total amount he spent on the books. We do this by subtracting the amount of money he had left after buying the books from the amount he started with.

\[ \text{Total cost of books} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Remaining amount} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of books} = 236 - 14 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of books} = 222 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we divide the total cost of the books by the number of books to find the average cost per book.

\[ \text{Average cost per book} = \frac{\text{Total cost of books}}{\text{Number of books}} \]
\[ \text{Average cost per book} = \frac{222}{6} \]
\[ \text{Average cost per book} = 37 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the average cost of each book is 37 dollars.

To find the average cost of each book, we first need to determine the total amount of money Fred spent on the books by subtracting the amount he had left from the total amount he had initially:

Total cost of books = Initial money - Money left
Total cost of books = 236 - 14
Total cost of books = 222 dollars

Now, we can find the average cost per book by dividing the total cost by the number of books:

Average cost per book = Total cost of books / Number of books
Average cost per book = 222 / 6
Average cost per book = 37 dollars

So, on average, each book cost 37 dollars.

To find the average cost of each book, first calculate the total amount of money Fred spent on the books. The total amount spent is the initial amount minus the amount he had after buying the books. So, 236 - 14 = 222 dollars. This is the total amount for 6 books, so we divide this by the number of books to get the average cost per book. So, 222 / 6 = 37 dollars.

To find the average cost of each book, we need to first determine how much Fred spent on the books. Fred started with $236 and had $14 left after buying the 6 books. Therefore, he spent:

\( 236 - 14 = 222 \) dollars on the books.

Since he bought 6 books, we can find the average cost per book by dividing the total amount spent by the number of books:

\( \frac{222}{6} = 37 \) dollars.

So, the average cost of each book is $37.

To find the average cost of each book, first calculate the total amount spent on the books. This is Fred's original amount minus the amount he had left after buying the books, which is 236 - 14 = 222 dollars. Next, divide the total amount spent by the number of books to find the average cost per book. This gives us 222 / 6 = 37 dollars per book.

Fred initially had 236 dollars. After buying 6 books, he had 14 dollars left. To find out how much he spent on the books, we subtract the remaining money from the initial amount:

Initial amount - Remaining amount = Amount spent
236 dollars - 14 dollars = 222 dollars

Now, we know that Fred spent a total of 222 dollars on 6 books. To find the average cost per book, we divide the total amount spent by the number of books:

Amount spent / Number of books = Average cost per book
222 dollars / 6 books = 37 dollars/book

Therefore, the average cost of each book is 37 dollars.

Let's denote the total cost of the 6 books as \( C \). According to the problem, Fred had 236 dollars initially and after buying the books, he had 14 dollars left. Therefore, the cost of the books is \( 236 - 14 = 222 \) dollars. Since Fred bought 6 books, the average cost per book is calculated by dividing the total cost of the books by the number of books. So, the average cost per book is \( \frac{222}{6} \).

Calculating this, we get:
\[
\frac{222}{6} = 37
\]

So, the average cost per book is \( 37 \) dollars.
