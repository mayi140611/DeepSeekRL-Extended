To determine how many pages Punger needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of baseball cards he will have.

Punger buys 60 packs of baseball cards, and each pack contains 7 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards is:

\[ 60 \text{ packs} \times 7 \text{ cards/pack} = 420 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages he needs to hold all 420 cards, given that each page can hold 10 cards. We do this by dividing the total number of cards by the number of cards each page can hold:

\[ \frac{420 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/page}} = 42 \text{ pages} \]

Since the result is an integer, we do not need to round up; 42 pages will exactly hold all the cards.

Thus, Punger needs to buy \(\boxed{42}\) pages.

To find out how many pages Punger needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of baseball cards he has, which is the product of the number of packs and the number of cards per pack. Then, we divide the total number of cards by the number of cards each page can hold.

The total number of cards is 60 packs * 7 cards per pack = 420 cards.

Each page can hold 10 cards, so Punger needs to divide the total number of cards by the number of cards each page can hold. The calculation is: 420 cards / 10 cards per page = 42 pages.

Therefore, Punger needs to buy 42 pages.

Punger has 60 packs of baseball cards, with each pack containing 7 cards. To find the total number of cards he has, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cards per pack:

\[ 60 \text{ packs} \times 7 \text{ cards/pack} = 420 \text{ cards} \]

Each page can hold 10 cards. To find out how many pages he needs, we divide the total number of cards by the capacity of one page:

\[ \frac{420 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/page}} = 42 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, Punger needs to buy 42 pages to hold all his cards.

To find out how many pages Punger needs, we first need to calculate the total number of baseball cards he has. He buys 60 packs, and each pack contains 7 cards. So, the total number of cards is calculated as 60 * 7 = 420 cards. 

Each page can hold 10 cards. To find out how many pages are needed, we divide the total number of cards by the capacity of each page. If there is a remainder after the division, Punger would need to buy an additional page to accommodate the remaining cards. 

Let's calculate the exact number of pages required.
