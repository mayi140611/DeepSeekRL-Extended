To determine the total number of pills Holly takes in a week, we first need to calculate the daily total of each type of pill.

1. **Insulin pills per day:**  
Holly takes 2 insulin pills per day.

2. **Blood pressure pills per day:**  
Holly takes 3 blood pressure pills per day.

3. **Anticonvulsants per day:**  
Holly takes twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills each day. Since she takes 3 blood pressure pills per day, the number of anticonvulsants she takes per day is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ anticonvulsants per day} \]

Next, we sum the daily totals of all the pills:
\[ \text{Total pills per day} = 2 \text{ insulin} + 3 \text{ blood pressure} + 6 \text{ anticonvulsants} = 11 \text{ pills per day} \]

Then, to find the weekly total, we multiply the daily total by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ \text{Total pills per week} = 11 \text{ pills per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 77 \text{ pills per week} \]

So, Holly takes 77 pills in a week.

First, calculate the number of each type of pill Holly takes per day: 2 insulin pills and 3 blood pressure pills, so 3 + 2 = 5 pills total. Twice as many as blood pressure pills is 2 × 3 = 6 anticonvulsant pills. Thus, the total number of pills Holly takes each day is 5 + 6 = 11 pills.

To find out how many pills Holly takes in a week, multiply the daily total by 7: 11 × 7 = 77 pills.

To calculate the total number of pills Holly takes in a week, we need to determine the daily consumption and then multiply by 7.

1. Insulin pills per day: 2
2. Blood pressure pills per day: 3
3. Anticonvulsants per day: twice as many as blood pressure pills, so 2 * 3 = 6

Total daily pills = Insulin pills + Blood pressure pills + Anticonvulsants
Total daily pills = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11

Total pills in a week = Total daily pills * 7
Total pills in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

To determine the total number of pills Holly takes in a week, we need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by 7.

1. **Insulin pills**: Holly needs 2 pills per day.
   \[
   2 \text{ pills/day}
   \]

2. **Blood pressure pills**: Holly needs 3 pills per day.
   \[
   3 \text{ pills/day}
   \]

3. **Anticonvulsants**: Holly needs twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills each day.
   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ anticonvulsants/day}
   \]

4. **Total pills per day**: Add the amount of each type of pill.
   \[
   2 + 3 + 6 = 11 \text{ pills/day}
   \]

5. **Total pills in a week**: Multiply the daily total by 7.
   \[
   11 \text{ pills/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ pills/week}

First, let's calculate how many anticonvulsants Holly takes per day:

\[
\text{Number of anticonvulsants per day} = 2 \times \text{Number of blood pressure pills per day} = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of each type of pill Holly takes per day:

\[
\text{Total pills per day} = \text{Insulin pills per day} + \text{Blood pressure pills per day} + \text{Anticonvulsants per day}
\]

\[
\text{Total pills per day} = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11
\]

To find out how many pills Holly takes in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[
\text{Total pills per week} = 11 \times 7
\]

\[
\text{Total pills per week} = 77

To find out how many pills Holly takes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of pills she takes each day and then multiply by the number of days in a week (7 days).

1. First, we determine the number of anticonvulsant pills she takes:
   Anticonvulsants = 2 * Blood pressure pills
                   = 2 * 3
                   = 6 pills per day

2. Next, we calculate the total number of pills per day:
   Total pills per day = Insulin pills + Blood pressure pills + Anticonvulsants
                      = 2 + 3 + 6
                      = 11 pills per day

3. Now, we calculate the total number of pills she takes in a week:
   Total pills per week = Total pills per day * Days per week
                       = 11 * 7
                       = 77 pills

To determine the total number of pills Holly takes in a week, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Insulin Pills:**
   Holly takes 2 insulin pills per day.

   \[
   \text{Total insulin pills per day} = 2
   \]

2. **Blood Pressure Pills:**
   Holly takes 3 blood pressure pills per day.

   \[
   \text{Total blood pressure pills per day} = 3

3. **Anticonvulsants:**
   Holly takes twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills each day.

   \[
   \text{Total anticonvulsants per day} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

4. **Total Daily Pills:**
   Now, we add up all the pills:

   \[
   \text{Total daily pills} = 2 \text{ (insulin)} + 3 \text{ (blood pressure)} + 6 \text{ (anticonvulsants)} = 11
   \]

5. **Weekly Pills:**
   To find the total number of pills for a week, multiply the daily total by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

To find out how many pills Holly takes in a week, we need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by 7.

1. Insulin pills: Holly needs to take 2 insulin pills per day.
   - In a week: \(2 \text{ pills/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ pills/week}\)

2. Blood pressure pills: Holly needs to take 3 blood pressure pills per day.
   - In a week: \(3 \text{ pills/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ pills/week}\)

3. Anticonvulsants: Holly needs to take twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills each day.
   - In a week: \(2 \times 3 \text{ pills/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ pills/week}\)

Now, let's add up the total number of pills for all medications in a week:

To determine the total number of pills Holly takes in a week, we need to calculate the daily pill intake for each type of medication and then find the weekly total.

1. **Insulin pills**: Holly takes 2 insulin pills per day.
   \[
   2 \text{ pills/day}
   \]

2. **Blood pressure pills**: Holly takes 3 blood pressure pills per day.
   \[
   3 \text{ pills/day}
   \]

3. **Anticonvulsants**: Holly takes twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills each day.
   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ pills/day}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pills Holly takes in one day:
\[
2 \text{ (insulin)} + 3 \text{ (blood pressure)} + 6 \text{ (anticonvulsants)} = 11 \text{ pills/day}
\]

Finally, we find the total number of pills Holly takes in a week (7 days):
\[
11 \text{ pills/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ pills/week}
\]

Thus, the total number of pills Holly takes in a week is \(\boxed{77}\).

To determine the total number of pills Holly takes in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply by 7.

First, let's break down the number of pills per day:
- Insulin pills per day: \(2\)
- Blood pressure pills per day: \(3\)
- Anticonvulsants per day: Twice the number of blood pressure pills, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\)

Next, we find the total number of pills per day by summing these values:
\[ 2 \text{ (insulin)} + 3 \text{ (blood pressure)} + 6 \text{ (anticonvulsants)} = 11 \text{ pills per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of pills per week, we multiply the daily total by 7:
\[ 11 \text{ pills/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ pills/week} \]

Therefore, Holly takes 77 pills in a week.

To determine the total number of pills Holly takes in a week, we need to first calculate the number of each type of pill she takes in a day.

For insulin pills:
She takes 2 insulin pills per day.

For blood pressure pills:
She takes 3 pills per day.

For anticonvulsants:
She takes twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills each day, so she takes \(2 \times 3 = 6\) anticonvulsants per day.

Now, let's sum up the daily total of pills she takes:

Total per day = Insulin pills + Blood pressure pills + Anticonvulsants
Total per day = 2 + 3 + 6
Total per day = 11 pills

Since there are 7 days in a week, we then calculate the weekly total:

Weekly total = Total per day \(\times\) 7
Weekly total = 11 \(\times\) 7
Weekly total = 77 pills

Therefore, Holly takes 77 pills in a week.
