###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

system
First, let's calculate the total hours Kat spends on strength training at the gym:
\[ \text{Strength training hours per week} = 1 \text{ hour/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kat spends at the boxing gym:
\[ \text{Boxing gym hours per week} = 1.5 \text{ hours/session} \times 4 \text{ sessions/week} = 6 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's add both totals to find the total training hours per week:
\[ \text{Total training hours per week} = 3 \text{ hours/week} + 6 \text{ hours/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To calculate the total hours Kat trains per week, we need to add the hours she spends in the gym doing strength training and the hours she spends at the boxing gym.

Strength training hours at the gym: 1 hour/visit * 3 visits/week = 3 hours/week
Boxing gym hours: 1.5 hours/visit * 4 visits/week = 6 hours/week

Total hours trained per week = Strength training hours + Boxing gym hours
Total hours trained per week = 3 hours + 6 hours
Total hours trained per week = 9 hours

To determine the total number of hours Kat trains each week, we need to consider both her strength training and her boxing training.

1. **Strength Training:**
   - Kat trains at the gym 3 times a week.
   - She spends 1 hour per session.
   - Total hours for strength training per week = \( 3 \text{ sessions} \times 1 \text{ hour/session} = 3 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Boxing Training:**
   - Kat trains at the boxing gym 4 times a week.
   - She spends 1.5 hours per session.
   - Total hours for boxing training per week = \( 4 \text{ sessions} \times 1.5 \text{ hours/session} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Total Training:**
   - Add the total hours for strength training and boxing training per week.
   - Total hours per week = \( 3 \text{ hours (strength training)} + 6 \text{ hours (boxing training)} = 9 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, Kat trains for a total of 9 hours a week.

The strength training session she does at the gym 3 times a week for 1 hour, giving us \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per week.

The boxing training she does at the boxing gym 4 times a week for 1.5 hours, giving us \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) hours per week.

Adding the two together, she trains \(3 + 6 = 9\) hours a week.

Kat's total training time per week includes both her strength training and boxing training.

Strength training: 1 hour/session * 3 sessions/week = 3 hours/week

Boxing training: 1.5 hours/session * 4 sessions/week = 6 hours/week

So her total training time per week is 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours.

To determine the total number of hours Kat trains per week, we need to consider both her strength training and her boxing training separately, and then add them together.

Kat spends 1 hour in the gym 3 times a week doing strength training. This means her strength training hours per week are:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Kat also trains at the boxing gym 4 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. This means her boxing training hours per week are:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours/session} \times 4 \text{ sessions/week} = 6 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, to find the total number of hours she trains per week, we add the strength training hours to the boxing training hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/week} + 6 \text{ hours/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, Kat trains a total of 9 hours per week.
