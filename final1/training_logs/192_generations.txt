system
Total cost for iPhones = 100 * 1000 = 100,000
Total cost for iPads = 20 * 900 = 18,000
Total cost for Apple TVs = 80 * 200 = 16,000
Total cost for all products = 100,000 + 18,000 + 16,000 = 134,000
Total products sold = 100 + 20 + 80 = 200
Average cost across all products = 134,000 / 200 = $670

The total revenue from iPhones is $100 * 100 = $10000. The total revenue from iPads is $900 * 20 = $18000. The total revenue from Apple TVs is $200 * 80 = $16000. The total revenue of all the products is $10000 + $18000 + $16000 = $44000. The total number of products sold is 100 + 20 + 80 = 200. The average cost is $44000 / 200 = $220.

To find the average cost across all products sold, we first calculate the total sales for each product and then divide by the total number of products sold.

For iPhones:
Sales = 100 iPhones * $1000 per iPhone = $100,000

For iPads:
Sales = 20 iPads * $900 per iPad = $18,000

For Apple TVs:
Sales = 80 Apple TVs * $200 per Apple TV = $16,000

Total sales:
Total sales = $100,000 + $18,000 + $16,000 = $134,000

Total number of products sold:
Total number of products = 100 iPhones + 20 iPads + 80 Apple TVs = 200 products

Average cost across all products:
Average cost = Total sales / Total number of products
Average cost = $134,000 / 200
Average cost = $670

The total cost for the iPhones is 100 × $1000 = $100,000. The total cost for the iPads is 20 × $900 = $18,000. The total cost for the Apple TVs is 80 × $200 = $16,000. The total cost for all the products is $100,000 + $18,000 + $16,000 = $134,000. The total number of all the products is 100 + 20 + 80 = 200. The average cost for all the products is $134,000 ÷ 200 = $670.

Let's calculate the total revenue from iPhones, iPads, and Apple TVs:

Total revenue from iPhones: 100 iPhones * $1000 each = $100,000
Total revenue from iPads: 20 iPads * $900 each = $18,000
Total revenue from Apple TVs: 80 Apple TVs * $200 each = $16,000

Now let's find the total revenue across all products:

Total revenue = $100,000 + $18,000 + $16,000 = $134,000

Now, let's find the total number of products sold:

Total number of products = 100 iPhones + 20 iPads + 80 Apple TVs = 200 products

Finally, we can calculate the average cost of all products sold today:

Average cost per product = Total revenue / Total number of products
                             = $134,000 / 200
                             = $670

The total sales from iPhones were \(100 \times 1000 = 100,000\) dollars. The total sales from iPads were \(20 \times 900 = 18,000\) dollars. The total sales from Apple TVs were \(80 \times 200 = 16,000\) dollars. Therefore, the total sales for all products sold today was \(100,000 + 18,000 + 16,000 = 134,000\) dollars. The average cost across all products sold today is \(134,000 \div (100 + 20 + 80) = 134,000 \div 200 = 670\) dollars.
