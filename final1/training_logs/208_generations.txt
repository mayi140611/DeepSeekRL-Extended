John saves $25 x 12 months = $300 per year for his vacation.
He saved $300 x 2 years = $600 for his vacation.
He had to spend $400 on his car, but after spending, his piggy bank has $600 - $400 = $200 left.

He put $25 per month for 2 years, which is 24 months (2 years * 12 months/year), so he put $25/month * 24 months = $600 into the piggy bank.
