###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Belinda can throw a ball at a speed of 20 feet/second. If the ball flies for 8 seconds before hitting the ground, and Belinda's border collie can run 5 feet/second, how many seconds will it take the border collie to catch up to the ball?

To determine how many seconds it will take the border collie to catch up to the ball, we first need to calculate the total distance the ball travels and then calculate how long it takes for the border collie to cover that distance.

The ball travels at a speed of 20 feet/second for 8 seconds. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the ball is:
\[
20 \, \text{feet/second} \times 8 \, \text{seconds} = 160 \, \text{feet}
\]

The border collie can run at a speed of 5 feet/second. To find out how long it will take for the border collie to run 160 feet, we divide the distance by the border collie's speed:
\[
\frac{160 \, \text{feet}}{5 \, \text{feet/second}} = 32 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Therefore, it will take the border collie 32 seconds to catch up to the ball.

To determine how many seconds it will take Belinda's border collie to catch up to the ball, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance the ball has traveled.
2. Determine the rate at which the border collie is closing the gap.
3. Calculate the time it takes for the border collie to catch up to the ball.

First, we know the ball has been flying for 8 seconds at a speed of 20 feet/second. The total distance the ball has traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{feet/second} \times 8 \, \text{seconds} = 160 \, \text{feet} \]

The border collie can run at a speed of 5 feet/second. To catch up to the ball, the border collie needs to close the 160 feet gap. The time it takes for the border collie to catch up to the ball is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{160 \, \text{feet}}{5 \, \text{feet/second}} = 32 \, \text{seconds} \]

To calculate the distance Belinda's ball has traveled, we use the formula: distance = speed × time.

For the ball: 
distance_ball = 20 feet/second × 8 seconds = 160 feet.

While the ball is flying, the border collie is running towards it at a speed of 5 feet per second. The difference in speed between Belinda's ball and the border collie is 20 - 5 = 15 feet per second.

To calculate the time it takes for the border collie to catch up to the ball, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the border collie:
time_catch_up = distance_ball / (speed_ball - speed_border_collie)
time_catch_up = 160 feet / 15 feet/second ≈ 10.67 seconds.

So, it will take the border collie approximately 10.67 seconds to catch up to the ball.

To determine how long it will take the border collie to catch up to the ball, we first need to calculate the total distance the ball travels. The ball is thrown at a speed of 20 feet/second for 8 seconds, so the distance the ball travels is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet/second} \times 8 \text{ seconds} = 160 \text{ feet} \]

The border collie runs at a speed of 5 feet/second. To find out how long it takes for the border collie to catch up to the ball, we divide the distance the ball has traveled by the speed of the border collie:

\[ \frac{160 \text{ feet}}{5 \text{ feet/second}} = 32 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take the border collie 32 seconds to catch up to the ball.

To determine how long it will take for the border collie to catch up to the ball, we first need to calculate the total distance the ball travels. Since Belinda throws the ball at a speed of 20 feet/second and the ball flies for 8 seconds, the total distance the ball travels is given by the product of the speed and time, which is 20 feet/second * 8 seconds = 160 feet.

Next, we consider the border collie's speed, which is 5 feet/second. The distance the border collie needs to cover to catch up to the ball is the same as the distance the ball has traveled, which is 160 feet. To find out how long it will take the border collie to cover this distance, we use the formula time = distance / speed.

Substituting the values, the time it takes for the border collie to catch up to the ball is 160 feet / 5 feet/second = 32 seconds.

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total distance the ball travels before hitting the ground. The ball travels at a speed of 20 feet/second for 8 seconds. Therefore, the distance the ball travels is:

\[ 20 \, \text{feet/second} \times 8 \, \text{seconds} = 160 \, \text{feet} \]

This means the ball has traveled 160 feet before hitting the ground. 

Next, we need to determine how long it will take for Belinda's border collie to run this same distance at a speed of 5 feet/second. Using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we find:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{160 \, \text{feet}}{5 \, \text{feet/second}} = 32 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take the border collie 32 seconds to catch up to the ball.

First, calculate the distance the ball travels before hitting the ground:
distance = speed * time
distance = 20 feet/second * 8 seconds = 160 feet.

Now, calculate how long it will take for the border collie to cover this distance running at 5 feet/second:
time = distance / speed
time = 160 feet / 5 feet/second = 32 seconds.

Thus, it will take the border collie 32 seconds to catch up to the ball.

To determine how long it will take the border collie to catch up to the ball, we need to calculate how far the ball travels before the collie starts chasing it.

The ball's speed is 20 feet/second, and it has been flying for 8 seconds before the collie starts chasing. Therefore, the ball has traveled a distance of \(20 \text{ feet/second} \times 8 \text{ seconds} = 160 \text{ feet}\) in that time.

The border collie runs at a speed of 5 feet/second. To catch up to the ball, the collie needs to cover the same distance that the ball has already traveled.

The time it takes for the collie to catch up to the ball can be calculated as the distance the ball has traveled divided by the collie's running speed: \( \frac{160 \text{ feet}}{5 \text{ feet/second}} = 32 \text{ seconds}\).

So, it will take the border collie 32 seconds to catch up to the ball.

To solve this, first calculate how far the ball travels in 8 seconds at a speed of 20 feet/second, then determine how long it will take the border collie to cover that distance at 5 feet/second.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance of ball = 20 feet/second * 8 seconds = 160 feet

Now, the border collie runs at 5 feet/second, so the time it takes to cover 160 feet is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 160 feet / 5 feet/second = 32 seconds

So, it will take the border collie 32 seconds to catch up to the ball.

The ball travels at a speed of 20 feet/second for 8 seconds, covering a distance of \( 20 \times 8 = 160 \) feet. The border collie has to run this same distance, and it runs at a speed of 5 feet/second. To find out how long it takes for the border collie to catch up, we divide the distance by the collie's speed: \( \frac{160}{5} = 32 \) seconds.

The border collie will need 32 seconds to catch up to the ball.
