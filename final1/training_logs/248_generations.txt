To calculate how many dollars cheaper the promotional subscription is compared to the normal one, we first need to determine the number of issues in an 18-month subscription and the discount per issue.

There are 12 months in a year, and the subscription is for 18 months, so:
\[12 \text{ months/year} \times 18 \text{ years} = 216 \text{ issues in total}\]

Since the magazine is published twice a month, the total number of issues is:
\[216 \text{ issues} \times 2 \text{ issues/month} = 432 \text{ issues}\]

Now, we apply the $0.25 discount to each issue:
\[432 \text{ issues} \times \$0.25 \text{ discount/issue} = \$108\]

This $108 represents how much the promotional subscription is cheaper per issue. To find out how many dollars cheaper the promotional subscription is, we need to calculate the total discount on the 18-month subscription:
\[\text{Total discount} = \$108 \times 18 \text{ months} = \$1,944\]

However, the question asks for the difference in cost between the promotional subscription and the normal one, not the total discount. Since the normal subscription cost is $34 for an 18-month period, the difference in cost is:
\[\text{Difference in cost} = \$34 (normal subscription) - \$1,944 (promotional subscription)\]
\[\text{Difference in cost} = -\$1,910\]

Therefore, the promotional subscription is $1,910 cheaper than the normal one.

The magazine is signed up for 18 months, with 18 / 2 = 9 issues. With the promotion, each issue is $0.25 cheaper, making the new price $34 - (0.25 * 9) = $30.25. The promotional subscription is $34.00 - $30.25 = $3.75 cheaper than the normal one.

The magazine subscription consists of 36 issues since it is twice a month. Thus, the promotional price per issue is 0.25 dollars, and the cost per issue after the promotion is 0.25 dollars. So, the cost of the 18-month subscription is 36 issues * 0.25 dollars = $9. Therefore, the promotional subscription is $34 - $9 = $25 cheaper than the normal one.

The magazine has 12 issues per subscription. With the promotion, there will be 4 issues for every 2-month period (2-month period * 4 = 4 issues). There are 18-months, so there will be 18/2 = 9 two-month periods. Each issue will be reduced in price by $0.25, so the total reduction in price will be 0.25 * 4 * 9 = $9.

Thus, 34 - 9 = $25 is the promotional price.

The magazine releases twice-a-month issues, so in an 18-month subscription, there are \(18 \times 12 \times 2 = 432\) issues. With the promotion of $0.25 off each issue, the total discount is \(432 \times 0.25 = 108\) dollars. The promotional subscription is thus \(34 - 108 = -74\) dollars cheaper than the normal one.

The magazine is published twice a month, so it will be published for \(18 \times 2 = 36\) times.

For the normal subscription, each issue costs $34, so for 36 issues, the total cost is \(34 \times 36 = 1224\) dollars.

For the promotional subscription, each issue is $34 - $0.25 = $33.75.

For 36 issues, the total cost is \(33.75 \times 36 = 1217\) dollars.

So, the promotional subscription is $1217 - $1224 = $7 cheaper than the normal subscription.

The magazine is delivered 2 times a month, so for 18 months, it is delivered \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) times.

The promotional price for each issue is reduced by $0.25, so for 36 issues, the total deduction is \( 36 \times 0.25 = 9 \) dollars.

The regular price for the subscription is $34, and the promotional price is \( 34 - 9 = 25 \) dollars.

Therefore, the promotional subscription is 9 dollars cheaper than the normal one.

The normal frequency of the magazine is twice a month, which means there are 12 issues in a year. The total number of issues for an 18-month subscription is \(12 \times 1.5 = 18\) issues.

The promotional subscription price per issue is \(34 - 0.25 = 33.75\) dollars.

The difference in price between the normal subscription and the promotional one is \(34 - 33.75 = 0.25\) dollars.

The magazine is published 2 times a month, so in 18 months, there are \(18 \times 2 = 36\) issues.

With the promotion, each issue costs \(34 - 0.25 = 33.75\) dollars.

The total cost for 36 issues on the promotional subscription is \(36 \times 33.75\).

To find out how many dollars cheaper the promotional subscription is compared to the normal one, we subtract the promotional total from the normal total:

\(34 \times 36 - 36 \times 33.75\)

Now, we calculate the final value.

The normal amount is 34 dollars. One issue costs $0.25, so for two issues it costs 0.25*2=0.5 dollars. The double-a-month is therefore 12 issues * 0.5=6 dollars cheaper. If one subscribes to the magazine for 18-months, there are 18*12=216 issues. This means the magazine subscription has a total promotion cost of 6*216=1296. The normal subscription cost is 34, so the difference is 34-1296=-1262 dollars.
