###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Max was doing homework in three different subjects. It took him 20 minutes to finish tasks from biology and two times more time to finish history. Geography took him the most time, three times more than history. How much time did Max spend on doing his homework?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the time Max spent on biology as B, history as H, and geography as G.

From the information given, we have:
B = 20 minutes (biology)
H = 2B (history is two times more than biology)
G = 3H (geography is three times more than history)

To find out how many minutes Max spent on geography, we first need to find out how much time he spent on history, which is:
H = 2B = 2 * 20 = 40 minutes

Then we can calculate the time for geography:
G = 3H = 3 * 40 = 120 minutes

Now, to find the total time spent on homework, we add up the times for all three subjects:
Total time = B + H + G
Total time = 20 + 40 + 120
Total time = 180 minutes

Therefore, Max spent a total of 180 minutes on doing his homework.

Let's denote the time Max spent on biology homework as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 20 \) minutes.

For history, the problem states that Max spent two times more time than on biology. Therefore, the time spent on history \( H \) is:
\[
H = 2 \times B = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

For geography, the problem says that Max spent three times more time than on history. Therefore, the time spent on geography \( G \) is:
\[
G = 3 \times H = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the total time spent on all three subjects:
\[
\text{Total time} = B + H + G = 20 + 40 + 120 = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, Max spent a total of 180 minutes on doing his homework.

Let's break down the time Max spent on each subject step by step:

1. Biology took 20 minutes.
2. History took two times more time than biology, so we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. Geography took three times more time than history, so we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add up the total time spent on all subjects:
\[
20 \text{ minutes (biology)} + 40 \text{ minutes (history)} + 120 \text{ minutes (Geography)} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, Max spent a total of 180 minutes doing his homework.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each subject:

20 minutes (Biology) + 40 minutes (History) + 120 minutes (Geography) = 180 minutes

Therefore, Max spent 180 minutes on his homework.

Max spent 20 minutes on biology. 

For history, he took two times more time than biology, which is 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.

For geography, it is three times more than history, which means 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Max spent on his homework was 20 (biology) + 40 (history) + 120 (geography) = 180 minutes.

Let's calculate the time spent on each subject step by step.

1. **Biology**: Max spent 20 minutes on biology.
   \[
   \text{Time for biology} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **History**: It took him two times more time to finish history compared to biology. Since biology took 20 minutes:
   \[
   \text{Time for history} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Geography**: Geography took him three times more time than history. Since history took 40 minutes:
   \[
   \text{Time for geography} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the times to find the total time spent on homework:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time for biology} + \text{Time for history} + \text{Time for geography}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 20 + 40 + 120 = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, Max spent a total of 180 minutes on doing his homework.

Let's denote the time Max spent on biology homework as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 20 \) minutes.

The time spent on history homework is two times the time spent on biology:

The time spent on geography homework is three times the time spent on history:
\[ G = 3H = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time spent on homework by adding the time spent on each subject:
\[ Total \, time = B + H + G = 20 + 40 + 120 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To determine the total time Max spent on his homework, we need to break down the time spent on each subject and then sum them up.

1. **Biology**: Max spent 20 minutes on biology.
2. **History**: The time spent on history is two times the time spent on biology. Therefore, the time spent on history is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ minutes}

Now, we sum the time spent on each subject to find the total time:
\[
20 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes}

For biology, Max spent 20 minutes which can be represented as 20 min.

For history, he spent twice more time than biology, which means:

\(2 \times 20\,min = 40\,min\)

For geography, it took him three times more than history, which means:

\(3 \times 40\,min = 120\,min\)

To find the total time Max spent on homework, we add up the times from all three subjects:

\(20\,min + 40\,min + 120\,min = 180\,min\)

So, Max spent a total of 180 minutes (or 3 hours) on his homework.
