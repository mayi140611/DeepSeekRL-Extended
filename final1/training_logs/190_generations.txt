<reasoning>
In Darcyâ€™s last year, Dexter was 8 years old. Since Darcy is twice as old as Dexter, Darcy was 16 years old last year. Last year, Dallas was 3 times the age of Darcy, which means Dallas was 48 last year. To find out how old Dallas is now, we need to add 2 to the age he was last year.

#### GENERATION 8 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dexter is 8 years old now.
2. Darcy is twice as old as Dexter, so:
   Darcy = 2 * Dexter = 2 * 8 = 16 years old now.
3. Last year, Dallas was 3 times the age of his sister Darcy. So:
   Last year, Dallas = 3 * Darcy = 3 * 16 = 48 years old.
4. If Dallas was 48 years old last year, we add 1 year to account for this year to find his current age:
   Dallas's current age = 48 + 1 = 49 years old.

#### GENERATION 11 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote Darcy's current age as \(D_d\) and Dallas's current age as \(D_d_l\).

From the information given:
1. Darcy is twice as old as Dexter, and Dexter is 8 years old. So, \(D_d = 2 \times 8 = 16\).
2. Last year, Dallas was 3 times the age of Darcy.

Last year, Darcy's age would have been \(16 - 1 = 15\). Since Dallas was 3 times Darcy's age at that time, Dallas's age last year was \(3 \times 15 = 45\).

If Dallas was 45 last year, then his current age is \(45 + 1 = 46\).

#### GENERATION 13 RESPONSE ####


system
Last year, Dallas was 3 times the age of Darcy, who at that time was 2 years younger (since Dexter is 8 and Darcy is twice that old this year). Thus, Dallas was 2 * 3 = 6 years old last year.

Since we're asked how old Dallas is right now, and he was 6 last year, we add 2 to that to find his age. Thus, Dallas is 6 + 2 = 8 years old right now.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Darcy is currently 8 years old.
2. Dexter is twice as old as Darcy, so Dexter is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
3. Last year, Dexter was 16 - 1 = 15 years old.
4. Yesterday, Dallas was three times as old as Darcy, so Dallas was 3 * 8 = 24 years.
5. This year, Dallas will be 24 + 1 = 25 years old.

So, Dallas is currently 25 years old.
