Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Peter started with $2 and left with $0.50.
   $2 - $0.50 = $1.50
   This indicates that he spent $1.50 on the soda.

2. The soda costs $0.25 per ounce.

3. To find out how many ounces he bought, we divide the total amount spent by the price per ounce:
   $1.50 รท $0.25 = 6 ounces

Therefore, Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.

Let's calculate the amount of money Peter spent on the soda. Peter initially brought $2 and left with $0.50, so he spent:

$2 - $0.50 = $1.50

Now, let's find out how many ounces of soda he bought at the cost of $0.25 per ounce. To do this, we divide the amount of money spent by the price per ounce:

$\frac{1.50}{0.25} = 6 \text{ ounces}$

Therefore, Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.

Peter's total amount spent at the store is the difference between the amount he brought with him and the amount he left with. This can be calculated as $2.00 - $0.50 = $1.50.

Since the soda costs $.25 an ounce, we can determine the number of ounces he bought by dividing his total amount spent by the price per ounce. Thus, the number of ounces is $1.50 / $0.25 = 6 ounces.

Therefore, Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.

To determine how many ounces of soda Peter bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Peter spent on the soda.
2. Determine how many ounces of soda can be bought with the amount of money spent.

Peter's initial amount of money is $2. After leaving the store with $0.50, he spent:
\[
2 - 0.50 = 1.50 \quad \text{dollars}
\]

The cost of soda is $0.25 per ounce. To find out how many ounces he bought with $1.50, we divide the amount of money spent by the cost per ounce:
\[
1.50 \div 0.25 = 6 \quad \text{ounces}
\]

Therefore, Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.

To determine how many ounces of soda Peter bought, let's break down the problem:

1) First, we need to find out how many dollars Peter spent on the soda.
   - He brought $2 and left with $0.50, so he spent $2 - $0.50 = $1.50 on the soda.

2) Next, we need to know how many dollars are in a standard amount of soda. Since each ounce of soda costs $0.25,
   - The number of ounces that $1.50 can buy is $1.50 / $0.25 = 6 ounces.

Therefore, Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.

To determine how many ounces of soda Peter bought, we start by calculating how much money he spent on the soda. He brought $2 with him and left with $0.50, so the amount spent is:

\[ 2.00 - 0.50 = 1.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many ounces of soda he bought with the $1.50 he spent. The cost of the soda is $0.25 per ounce. Therefore, the number of ounces he bought is:

\[ \frac{1.50}{0.25} = 6 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.
