<reasoning>
To find out how many more tails than heads were flipped, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tails. Since the total number of flips is 211 and the number of heads is 65, the number of tails is the total number of flips minus the number of heads:
\[ \text{Number of tails} = 211 - 65 \]

2. Calculate how many more tails than heads were flipped by subtracting the number of heads from the number of tails:
\[ \text{Difference between tails and heads} = \text{Number of tails} - 65 \]

Now, we can calculate these values.
</reasoning>
<answer>
\[ \text{Number of tails} = 211 - 65 = 146 \]
\[ \text{Difference between tails and heads} = 146 - 65 = 81 \]

To find out how many more tails than heads the solver got, first we need to determine the number of tails. The total number of flips is 211, and out of these, 65 are heads. Therefore, the number of tails is \(211 - 65 = 146\).

Then, we subtract the number of heads from the number of tails to find out how many more tails than heads were obtained: \(146 - 65 = 81\).

So, the solver got 81 more tails than heads.

To determine how many more tails than heads the solver got, we first need to find out how many tails were flipped. The solver got a head on 65 flips, so the number of tails is:
\[ \text{Number of tails} = \text{Total flips} - \text{Number of heads} = 211 - 65 = 146 \]

Next, we need to find the difference between the number of tails and the number of heads:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of tails} - \text{Number of heads} = 146 - 65 = 81 \]

Therefore, there are 81 more tails than heads.

For each flip of a coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails. If the coin is flipped 211 times, there will be 211 possible head-tail outcomes since each flip has 2 possibilities and there are 211 flips.

We are given that there were 65 heads in 211 flips. To find out the number of tails, we subtract the number of heads from the total number of flips: \(211 - 65 = 146\) tails.

To find how many more tails than heads were obtained, we subtract the number of heads from the number of tails: \(146 - 65 = 81\).

Therefore, he got 81 more tails than heads.

The total number of coin flips is 211. Out of these, 65 resulted in heads. Therefore, the number of tails is:
\[ 211 - 65 = 146 \]

To find out how many more tails than heads there were, we subtract the number of heads from the number of tails:
\[ 146 - 65 = 81 \]

Thus, there were 81 more tails than heads.

The solver flipped a coin 211 times and got heads 65 times. 

To find out how many tails he got, we can subtract the number of heads from the total number of flips:

211 total flips - 65 heads = 146 tails

Now, to find out how many more tails than heads he got, we subtract the number of heads from the number of tails:

146 tails - 65 heads = 81 more tails than heads

First, we need to determine the number of tails obtained by the solver. Since a total of 211 flips were made and heads were obtained 65 times, the number of tails can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of tails} = \text{Total flips} - \text{Number of heads} = 211 - 65 = 146 \]

Next, we need to find the difference between the number of tails and heads:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of tails} - \text{Number of heads} = 146 - 65 = 81 \]

So the number of tails is 81 more than the number of heads.

To determine how many more tails were flipped compared to heads, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tails:
   The total number of coin flips is 211, and the number of heads is 65. Therefore, the number of tails is:
   \[
   211 - 65 = 146

Let's break down the problem:

1. The total number of coin flips is 211.
2. The solver got a head on 65 flips.

First, we need to find the number of tails by subtracting the number of heads from the total number of flips:
\[ \text{Number of tails} = \text{Total flips} - \text{Number of heads} = 211 - 65 = 146 \]

Next, we need to determine how many more tails than heads there are:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of tails} - \text{Number of heads} = 146 - 65 = 81 \]

<reasoning>
In a coin flip, the total number of flips and the number of heads and tails must always sum up to 211 and 65, respectively. 

Let's denote:
- The number of heads as \( H \),
- The number of tails as \( T \).

From the problem, we have:
\[ H + T + 65 = 211 \]
\[ T + 65 = 211 - 65 \]
\[ T + 65 = 146 \]
\[ T = 146 - 65 \]
\[ T = 81 \]

So, the number of tails is 81.

The number of heads is 65.

The difference between the number of tails and the number of heads is:
\[ T - H = 81 - 65 = 16 \]

Therefore, there are 16 more tails than heads.

To determine how many more tails than heads the solver got, we start by calculating the number of tails, which is the difference between the total number of flips and the number of heads.

The total number of flips is 211, and the number of heads is 65. Therefore, the number of tails is:
\[ 211 - 65 = 146 \]

The difference between the number of tails and the number of heads is:
\[ 146 - 65 = 81 \]

The coin was flipped 211 times, and the solver got a head on 65 of those flips. The remaining flips must be tails. To find out how many tails were flipped, we subtract the number of heads from the total number of flips:

\[ \text{Total flips} - \text{Heads} = \text{Tails} \]

\[ 211 - 65 = 146 \text{ tails} \]

To find how many more tails than heads were flipped, we subtract the number of heads from the number of tails:

\[ \text{Tails} - \text{Heads} = \text{Difference} \]

\[ 146 - 65 = 81 \]

So, the solver got 81 more tails than heads.

To determine how many more tails than heads the solver got, we first need to know the total number of coin flips and the number of tails.

1. The solver flips the coin 211 times, and out of these, he gets heads on 65 of the flips. Therefore, the number of tails is calculated as follows:
   - Total heads = 65
   - Total tails = Total flips - Total heads = 211 - 65 = 146

2. Now, we need to find out how many more tails than heads there are:
   - More tails than heads = Total tails - Total heads = 146 - 65 = 81

So, the solver got 81 more tails than heads.

To determine how many more tails than heads the solver got, we first need to find the number of tails. Since the coin is flipped 211 times and the solver gets a head on 65 of the flips, the number of tails would be:

\[ \text{Number of tails} = \text{Total flips} - \text{Number of heads} \]
\[ \text{Number of tails} = 211 - 65 \]
\[ \text{Number of tails} = 146 \]

Now, to find how many more tails than heads the solver got, we subtract the number of heads from the number of tails:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of tails} - \text{Number of heads} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 146 - 65 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 81 \]

So, the solver got 81 more tails than heads.
