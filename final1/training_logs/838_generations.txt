###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Antonio is preparing a meal of spaghetti and meatballs for his family.  His recipe for meatballs calls for 1/8 of a pound of hamburger per meatball.  Antonio has 8 family members, including himself.  If he uses 4 pounds of hamburger to make meatballs, and each member of the family eats an equal number of meatballs, how many meatballs will Antonio eat?

<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how many meatballs Antonio can make with 4 pounds of hamburger. Since each meatball requires 1/8 of a pound of hamburger, we divide the total amount of hamburger by the amount needed per meatball:

\( \frac{4 \text{ pounds}}{1/8 \text{ pound per meatball}} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ meatballs} \)

Now, since there are 8 family members including Antonio, and they will all eat an equal number of meatballs, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of family members to find out how many meatballs each person will eat:

\( \frac{32 \text{ meatballs}}{8 \text{ family members}} = 4 \text{ meatballs per person} \)

Therefore, Antonio will eat 4 meatballs.

First, let's calculate the total number of meatballs that Antonio can make with 4 pounds of hamburger. Since each meatball requires 1/8 of a pound of hamburger, using 4 pounds of hamburger will give us \( 4 \div \frac{1}{8} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \) meatballs.

Next, we need to determine how many meatballs each family member gets. With 8 family members and a total of 32 meatballs, each family member will receive \( \frac{32}{8} = 4 \) meatballs.

Since Antonio is one of the family members, he will eat one of the meatballs.

Therefore, Antonio will eat 4 meatballs.

First, we need to determine how many meatballs Antonio can make with the 4 pounds of hamburger. To do this, we divide the total amount of hamburger by the amount required per meatball: \( 4 \text{ pounds} / (1/8 \text{ pound/meatball}) = 4 * 8 = 32 \text{ meatballs} \).

Next, we need to distribute the 32 meatballs among Antonio's family members. Since there are 8 family members, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of family members: \( 32 \text{ meatballs} / 8 = 4 \text{ meatballs per family member} \).

Therefore, Antonio will eat 4 meatballs.

First, we need to determine how many meatballs Antonio can make with the 4 pounds of hamburger he has. To do this, we divide the total amount of hamburger by the amount of hamburger needed for each meatball:
\[ \text{Number of meatballs per pound} = \frac{1}{8} \]
\[ \text{Total number of meatballs} = 4 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \]

So, Antonio can make \(\frac{1}{2}\) meatballs with 4 pounds of hamburger.

Next, we need to determine how many family members there are. The family includes Antonio and his 8 members, making a total of 9 family members. To find out how many meatballs each family member gets, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of family members:
\[ \text{Meatballs per family member} = \frac{1}{2} \div 9 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{18} \]

Therefore, each family member will eat \(\frac{1}{18}\) meatballs.

Now, we can calculate how many meatballs Antonio will eat. Since Antonio is one of the family members, his share is the same as the share for anyone else:
\[ \text{Meatballs Antonio eats} = \frac{1}{18} \]

Thus, Antonio will eat \(\frac{1}{18}\) meatballs.

\(\frac{1}{18}\)

First, let's determine the total number of meatballs Antonio can make with 4 pounds of hamburger. Since each meatball requires \(\frac{1}{8}\) pound of hamburger, we divide 4 pounds by \(\frac{1}{8}\) pound per meatball:

\[
4 \text{ pounds} \div \frac{1}{8} \text{ pound per meatball} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ meatballs}

Since there are 8 family members and they all eat an equal number of meatballs, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of family members:

\[

First, let's calculate the total number of meatballs Antonio can make with 4 pounds of hamburger. Since each meatball requires 1/8 of a pound of hamburger, we divide the total amount of hamburger by the amount of hamburger needed per meatball:

$$
\frac{4 \text{ pounds}}{\frac{1}{8} \text{ pound per meatball}} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ meatballs}
$$

Next, we need to determine how many people will be eating meatballs. Antonio has 8 family members, including himself, so there are 9 people in total.

We can now calculate the number of meatballs each person will get by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of people:

$$
\frac{32 \text{ meatballs}}{9 \text{ people}} = \frac{32}{9} \approx 3.56
$$

Since you can't eat half a meatball, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each person, including Antonio, will get 3 meatballs.

Therefore, Antonio will eat 3 meatballs.

First, we need to calculate the total number of meatballs Antonio can make with 4 pounds of hamburger. To do this, we divide the total amount of hamburger by the amount used per meatball.

$$
\text{Total meatballs} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ meatballs}
$$

Now, since there are 8 family members, each consuming an equal number of meatballs, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of family members to find out how many meatballs each person will eat.

$$
\text{Meatballs per family member} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Number of family members}} = \frac{32 \text{ meatballs}}{8}

$$
\text{Meatballs per family member} = 4 \text{ meatballs per family member}

Therefore, Antonio will eat 4 meatballs.
