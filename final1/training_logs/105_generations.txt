320
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find the total number of goats, we first need to determine how many goats Paddington has. We know that Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington, and Washington has 140 goats.

So, the number of goats Paddington has is:
140 (Washington's goats) + 40 = 180 goats.

Now, to find the total number of goats between Washington and Paddington, we add the number of goats each has:
140 (Washington's goats) + 180 (Paddington's goats) = 320 goats.

Therefore, the total number of goats they have is 320.

To find the total number of goats that Paddington and Washington have, we need to first determine how many goats Paddington has. We can do this by adding 40 to the number of goats Washington has.

Paddington has 140 + 40 = 180 goats.

Now we can add the number of goats each has to find the total:

140 (Washington's goats) + 180 (Paddington's goats) = 320 goats.

So, Paddington and Washington have 320 goats in total.

To find out how many goats Paddington and Washington have in total, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many goats Paddington has. Since Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington and Washington has 140 goats, we can calculate the number of goats Paddington has by adding 40 to 140.
2. Add the number of goats Paddington has to the number of goats Washington has to find the total number of goats.

Let's perform these calculations.

Paddington's goats: \( 140 + 40 \)

Total goats: \( 140 + (140 + 40) \)

First, calculate the number of goats Paddington has:
\[ 140 + 40 = 180 \]

Now, add this to the number of goats Washington has:
\[ 140 + 180 = 320 \]

Therefore, Paddington and Washington have a total of 320 goats.

To determine the total number of goats, we first need to find out how many goats Paddington has.

Given:
- Washington has 140 goats.
- Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington.

We calculate the number of goats Paddington has:
\[ \text{Paddington's goats} = \text{Washington's goats} + 40 \]
\[ \text{Paddington's goats} = 140 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Paddington's goats} = 180 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of goats by adding the number of goats each person has:
\[ \text{Total goats} = \text{Washington's goats} + \text{Paddington's goats} \]
\[ \text{Total goats} = 140 + 180 \]
\[ \text{Total goats} = 320 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats they have is 320.

<reasoning>
Let \( G_W \) represent the number of goats Washington has, and \( G_P \) represent the number of goats Paddington has. According to the problem, we have the following relationship between their goats:
\[
G_P = G_W + 40
\]

Given that Washington has 140 goats, \( G_W = 140 \).

Substitute \( G_W \) into the equation:
\[
G_P = 140 + 40
\]

Calculate the number of goats Paddington has:
\[
G_P = 180
\]

To find the total number of goats both have, add the goats from Washington and Paddington:
\[
\text{Total goats} = G_W + G_P = 140 + 180 = 320
\]

Therefore, the total number of goats they have together is 320.

Let's denote the number of goats Washington has as \( W \) and the number of goats Paddington has as \( P \).

From the information given, we know:
- \( W = 140 \)
- Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington, so \( P = W + 40 \)

Now, we can calculate the number of goats Paddington has:
\[ P = 140 + 40 = 180 \]

To find the total number of goats they have together, we add Washington's and Paddington's goats:
\[ \text{Total} = W + P = 140 + 180 = 320 \]

So, together they have 320 goats.

To find the total number of goats, we first need to determine how many goats Paddington has. Since Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington, we can calculate:

Paddington's goats = Washington's goats + 40
Paddington's goats = 140 + 40
Paddington's goats = 180

Now, to find the total number of goats (Paddington's and Washington's), we add their goats together:

Total goats = Paddington's goats + Washington's goats
Total goats = 180 + 140
Total goats = 320

So, they have 320 goats in total.

We are given that Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington and Washington has 140 goats.

This gives us the following information:
- Washington's goats = 140
- Paddington's goats = 140 + 40

We add the two quantities to find the total number of goats they have:
- Total goats = Washington's goats + Paddington's goats
- Total goats = 140 + 180

Let's compute this:
- Total goats = 140 + 180

Performing the sum gives:
- Total goats = 320

Therefore, the answer is 320.

We need to find out how many goats Paddington has, and then add that number to the number of goats Washington has to find the total number of goats.

Let's identify the information given:
- Washington has 140 goats,
- Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington.

We can set up a simple equation to find the number of goats Paddington has:
- Let's say the number of goats Paddington has is x.
- We know that Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington, which means x = 140 + 40.

Now we can solve the equation for x:
x = 140 + 40
x = 180

Therefore, Paddington has 180 goats.

To find the total number of goats, we add the number of goats Washington has and the number of goats Paddington has:
Total goats = Washington's goats + Paddington's goats
Total goats = 140 + 180
Total goats = 320

Therefore, in total, they have 320 goats.

Person A's reasoning:
Let's denote the number of goats Washington has as W. According to the information given, W = 140. We are told that Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington. So, Paddington has \( W + 40 \) goats.

Person B's reasoning:
To find out how many goats they have in total, we need to add the number of goats Washington has to the number of goats Paddington has. Since Washington has 140 goats, Paddington has \( 140 + 40 \) goats.

Person C's reasoning:
We know that Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington. If Washington has 140 goats, it means Paddington has \( 140 + 40 \) goats. So, the total number of goats they have together is the sum of Washington's goats and Paddington's goats, which is \( 140 + (140 + 40) \).

Person D's reasoning:
To find the total number of goats, we add the number of goats each person has. Since Washington has 140 goats and Paddington has 40 more than Washington, Paddington has \( 140 + 40 \) goats. Adding both together gives \( 140 + (140 + 40) = 320 \).

Person E's reasoning:
Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington. If Washington has 140 goats, then Paddington has \( 140 + 40 \) goats, which equals 180 goats. Adding both Washington and Paddington's goats together gives a total of \( 140 + 180 = 320 \).

Person F's reasoning:
If Washington has 140 goats, Paddington has 40 more, meaning Paddington has \( 140 + 40 = 180 \) goats. In addition to Washington's goats, Paddington has 180, making the total \( 140 + 180 = 320 \).

Person G's reasoning:
To find the total number of goats, we can add the goats Washington has to the goats Paddington has. Washington has 140 goats, and Paddington has \( 140 + 40 \) goats, which is 180. Therefore, the total number of goats is \( 140 + 180 = 320 \).

Person H's reasoning:
Adding the number of goats each person has gives the total number. Washington has 140 goats, and Paddington has \( 140 + 40 \) goats, which equals 180 goats. Altogether, they have \( 140 + 180 = 320 \) goats.

Person I's reasoning:
Given that Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington, if Washington has 140 goats, Paddington has \( 140 + 40 \) goats, which equals 180 goats. Adding Washington and Paddington's goats together gives \( 140 + 180 = 320 \) goats.

Person J's reasoning:
To find the total number of goats they have together, we add the number of goats Washington has to the number of goats Paddington has. Washington has 140 goats, and Paddington has \( 140 + 40 \) goats, which equals 180 goats. Adding both together gives \( 140 + 180 \), which equals 320 goats.

To find the total number of goats, we first need to calculate how many goats Paddington has and then add that to Washington's total.

Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington, so:
Paddington's goats = Washington's goats + 40
Paddington's goats = 140 + 40
Paddington's goats = 180

Now we add Washington's and Paddington's goats together:
Total goats = Washington's goats + Paddington's goats
Total goats = 140 + 180
Total goats = 320
