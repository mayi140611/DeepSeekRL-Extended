###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

At football tryouts, the coach wanted to see who could throw the ball the farthest.  Parker threw the ball 16 yards.  Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker and Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant.  Compared to Parker, how much farther did Kyle throw the ball?

Let's calculate the distance each person threw the ball. Parker threw the ball 16 yards. Grant threw the ball 25% farther than Parker. To find out how much farther Grant threw the ball, we calculate 25% of Parker's throw distance:

25% of 16 yards = 0.25 * 16 = 4 yards

Grant threw the ball 4 yards farther than Parker. Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant:

2 times 4 yards = 8 yards

Now we know that Kyle threw the ball 8 yards and Parker threw it 16 yards. To find out how much farther Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker, we subtract Parker's throw distance from Kyle's throw distance:

8 yards - 16 yards = -8 yards

Kyle threw the ball 8 yards less, or in other words, 8 yards closer compared to Parker.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Parker threw the ball 16 yards.
2. Grant threw the ball 25% farther than Parker.
   - To find out how much farther Grant threw the ball, we need to calculate 25% of 16 yards and add it to the original 16 yards.
   - 25% of 16 yards = 0.25 * 16 = 4 yards.
   - Therefore, Grant threw the ball 16 yards + 4 yards = 20 yards.
3. Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant.
   - To find out how much farther Kyle threw the ball, we need to multiply Grant's distance by 2.
   - Kyle's distance = 20 yards * 2 = 40 yards.
4. To find out how much farther Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker, we need to subtract Parker's distance from Kyle's distance.
   - Difference = Kyle's distance - Parker's distance = 40 yards - 16 yards = 24 yards.

So, Kyle threw the ball 24 yards farther than Parker.

We start by calculating how far Grant threw the ball. Since Grant threw 25 percent farther than Parker:

First, we find 25 percent of Parker's throw distance:
\( 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ yards} \)

Next, we add this to Parker's throw distance to find Grant's throw distance:
\( 16 + 4 = 20 \text{ yards} \)

Grant threw the ball 20 yards.

Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant:
\( 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ yards} \)

Now, to determine how much farther Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker:
\( 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ yards} \)

Kyle threw the ball 24 yards farther than Parker.

First, we need to calculate how far Grant threw the ball. Since Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker, we can calculate this by finding 25% of Parker's throw distance and adding it to Parker's throw distance.
Grant's throw distance = Parker's throw distance + (25% of Parker's throw distance)
Grant's throw distance = 16 yards + (0.25 * 16)
Grant's throw distance = 16 yards + 4 yards = 20 yards

Next, we need to calculate how far Kyle threw the ball. Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant, so we multiply Grant's throw distance by 2.
Kyle's throw distance = 2 * Grant's throw distance
Kyle's throw distance = 2 * 20 yards = 40 yards

Now, we need to compare Kyle's throw distance to Parker's throw distance to find out how much farther Kyle threw the ball.
Difference in throw distance = Kyle's throw distance - Parker's throw distance
Difference in throw distance = 40 yards - 16 yards = 24 yards

So, Kyle threw the ball 24 yards farther than Parker.

First, we need to determine how far Grant threw the ball. Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker. Parker threw the ball 16 yards. To find out how far Grant threw the ball, we calculate 25% of 16 yards and add it to 16 yards:

\[ \text{Grant's throw} = 16 \, \text{yards} + (16 \, \text{yards} \times 0.25) \]

\[ \text{Grant's throw} = 16 \, \text{yards} + 4 \, \text{yards} \]

\[ \text{Grant's throw} = 20 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Kyle threw the ball. Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant. Since Grant threw the ball 20 yards, we multiply this by 2:

\[ \text{Kyle's throw} = 20 \, \text{yards} \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Kyle's throw} = 40 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we compare Kyle's throw to Parker's throw to find out how much farther Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker. Parker threw the ball 16 yards, and Kyle threw it 40 yards. The difference in distance is:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Kyle's throw} - \text{Parker's throw} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 40 \, \text{yards} - 16 \, \text{yards} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 24 \, \text{yards} \]

Kyle threw the ball 24 yards farther than Parker.

First, let's calculate how far Grant threw the ball. Since Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker, we need to find 25 percent of Parker's throw and add it to Parker's thrown distance:

25% of 16 yards = (25/100) * 16 yards = 0.25 * 16 yards = 4 yards

Grant's throw distance = Parker's distance + 25% more
Grant's distance = 16 yards + 4 yards = 20 yards

Next, Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant. Therefore, we need to calculate twice Grant's throw distance:

Kyle's distance = 2 * Grant's distance
Kyle's distance = 2 * 20 yards = 40 yards

Now, to find out how much farther Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker, we subtract Parker's thrown distance from Kyle's thrown distance:

Difference = Kyle's distance - Parker's distance
Difference = 40 yards - 16 yards = 24 yards

Therefore, Kyle threw the ball 24 yards farther than Parker.

To find out how far Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker, we first need to determine how far Grant threw the ball. Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker, so we calculate 25% of Parker's throw distance and add it to Parker's throw distance.

Grant's throw distance = Parker's throw distance + 25% of Parker's throw distance
Grant's throw distance = 16 yards + (0.25 * 16 yards)
Grant's throw distance = 16 yards + 4 yards
Grant's throw distance = 20 yards

Now, Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant, so we multiply Grant's throw distance by 2.

Kyle's throw distance = 2 * Grant's throw distance
Kyle's throw distance = 2 * 20 yards
Kyle's throw distance = 40 yards

To find out how much farther Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker, we subtract Parker's throw distance from Kyle's throw distance.

To determine how much farther Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker, we need to calculate the distances thrown by Grant and Kyle based on the information given.
