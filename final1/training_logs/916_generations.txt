system
<reasoning>
To calculate the total expenditure, we need to multiply the unit cost of each item by the quantity purchased and then sum these amounts.

For drinks, the unit cost is $2 and Betty buys 10 drinks, so the cost is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

For cakes, the unit cost is $10 and Betty buys 5 cakes, so the cost is \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) dollars.

For ice creams, the unit cost is $5 and Betty buys 100 ice creams, so the cost is \( 100 \times 5 = 500 \) dollars.

Now, we sum the costs:
\[ 20 + 50 + 500 = 570 \]

So, Betty spends a total of $570.

To determine the total amount Betty spends, we need to calculate the cost of each item she buys and then sum these values.

1. Calculate the cost of drinks:
   Betty buys 10 drinks at $2 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of drinks} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the cost of cakes:
   Betty buys 5 cakes at $10 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of cakes} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the cost of ice creams:
   Betty buys 100 ice creams at $5 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of ice creams} = 100 \times 5 = 500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Sum the costs of all items to get the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20 + 50 + 500 = 570 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Betty buys drinks at a unit cost of $2, cakes at $10, and ice creams at $5. She buys 10 drinks, 5 cakes, and 100 ice creams. So the total cost for drinks is $2 x 10 = $20. For cakes, the total cost is $10 x 5 = $50. For ice creams, the total cost is $5 x 100 = $500. Adding up all the costs, Betty spends $20 + $50 + $500 = $570.

To calculate the total amount Betty spends, we need to consider the cost per item and the quantity she buys. 

For drinks:
- Unit cost: $2
- Quantity: 10
- Total cost for drinks: $2 × 10 = $20

For cakes:
- Unit cost: $10
- Quantity: 5
- Total cost for cakes: $10 × 5 = $50

For ice creams:
- Unit cost: $5
- Quantity: 100
- Total cost for ice creams: $5 × 100 = $500

Now, we sum up the total cost for all items to find out how much Betty spends:
Total cost = Total cost for drinks + Total cost for cakes + Total cost for ice creams
Total cost = $20 + $50 + $500
Total cost = $570

Therefore, Betty spends $570 on drinks, cakes, and ice creams.

To calculate the total amount Betty spends on drinks, cakes, and ice creams, we need to multiply the unit cost by the quantity she purchases for each item.

For drinks:
10 drinks * $2 per drink = $20

For cakes:
5 cakes * $10 per cake = $50

For ice creams:
100 ice creams * $5 per ice cream = $500

Now, add up the costs of each item:
$20 (drinks) + $50 (cakes) + $500 (ice creams) = $570

Therefore, Betty spends a total of $570.

To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the unit cost of each item by the quantity she is buying and then sum up the costs.

For drinks: \( 10 \times \$2 = \$20 \)

For cakes: \( 5 \times \$10 = \$50 \)

For ice creams: \( 100 \times \$5 = \$500 \)

Now, we add up all the costs: \( \$20 + \$50 + \$500 = \$570 \)

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Drinks:**
   - Betty buys 10 drinks.
   - Each drink costs $2.
   - Total cost for drinks = 10 drinks * $2 per drink = $20.

2. **Cakes:**
   - Betty buys 5 cakes.
   - Each cake costs $10.
   - Total cost for cakes = 5 cakes * $10 per cake = $50.

3. **Ice creams:**
   - Betty buys 100 ice creams.
   - Each ice cream costs $5.
   - Total cost for ice creams = 100 ice creams * $5 per ice cream = $500.

Now, we sum up the costs for each item:
- Total cost for drinks = $20.
- Total cost for cakes = $50.
- Total cost for ice creams = $500.

Total amount spent = $20 + $50 + $500 = $570.

Therefore, Betty spends $570 in total for the party.
