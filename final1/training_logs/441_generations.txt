###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Derek is watching the construction cranes downtown and is trying to figure out how much taller they have to be than the building they are building. He sees one crane that is 228 feet tall finishing a building that was 200 feet tall. He sees another that is 120 feet tall finishing a building that is 100 feet tall. The final crane he sees is 147 feet tall, finishing a building that is 140 feet tall. On average, what percentage taller are the cranes than the building?

To find the average percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings, we need to calculate the percentage difference for each crane and then find the average of these percentage differences.

1. For the first crane: Height difference = 228 - 200 = 28 feet. Percentage difference = (28 / 200) * 100 = 14%.
2. For the second crane: Height difference = 120 - 100 = 20 feet. Percentage difference = (20 / 100) * 100 = 20%.
3. For the third crane: Height difference = 147 - 140 = 7 feet. Percentage difference = (7 / 140) * 100 = 5%.

Now, we add up the percentage differences and divide by the number of cranes to find the average percentage difference.

(Average percentage difference) = (14% + 20% + 5%) / 3
Average percentage difference = 39% / 3
Average percentage difference = 13%

Therefore, on average, cranes are 13% taller than the building.

To find the average percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings, we need to calculate the percentage increase for each crane and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the percentage increase for the first crane:
- Crane height: 228 feet
- Building height: 200 feet
- Increase: 228 - 200 = 28 feet
- Percentage increase: (28 / 200) * 100 = 14%

Next, for the second crane:
- Crane height: 120 feet
- Building height: 100 feet
- Increase: 120 - 100 = 20 feet
- Percentage increase: (20 / 100) * 100 = 20%

Finally, for the third crane:
- Crane height: 147 feet
- Building height: 140 feet
- Increase: 147 - 140 = 7 feet
- Percentage increase: (7 / 140) * 100 = 5%

Now, let's calculate the average percentage increase:
- Average percentage increase = (Percentage increase of first crane + Percentage increase of second crane + Percentage increase of third crane) / 3
- Average percentage increase = (14% + 20% + 5%) / 3 = 39% / 3 = 13%

Therefore, on average, the cranes are 13% taller than the buildings.

To find the average percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings, we first calculate the height difference for each crane-building pair and then find the average of these differences.

For the first crane:
\[ \text{Height difference} = 228 \text{ ft} - 200 \text{ ft} = 28 \text{ ft} \]
\[ \text{Percentage higher} = \frac{28 \text{ ft}}{200 \text{ ft}} \times 100\% = 14\% \]

For the second crane:
\[ \text{Height difference} = 120 \text{ ft} - 100 \text{ ft} = 20 \text{ ft} \]
\[ \text{Percentage higher} = \frac{20 \text{ ft}}{100 \text{ ft}} \times 100\% = 20\% \]

For the third crane:
\[ \text{Height difference} = 147 \text{ ft} - 140 \text{ ft} = 7 \text{ ft} \]
\[ \text{Percentage higher} = \frac{7 \text{ ft}}{140 \text{ ft}} \times 100\% = 5\% \]

Now, to find the average percentage higher for all three cranes:
\[ \text{Average percentage higher} = \frac{14\% + 20\% + 5\%}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average percentage higher} = \frac{39\%}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average percentage higher} = 13\% \]

To find the percentage taller the cranes are compared to the buildings they are constructing, we need to calculate the difference in height between each crane and the building it is constructing, then divide that difference by the height of the building to get the fraction of the building's height that the crane is taller by. Finally, we'll convert that fraction to a percentage.

For the first crane:
Height difference = 228 - 200 = 28 feet
Height of crane / Height of building = 28 / 200 = 0.14
As a percentage: 0.14 * 100 = 14%

For the second crane:
Height difference = 120 - 100 = 20 feet
Height of crane / Height of building = 20 / 100 = 0.20
As a percentage: 0.20 * 100 = 20%

For the final crane:
Height difference = 147 - 140 = 7 feet
Height of crane / Height of building = 7 / 140 = 0.05
As a percentage: 0.05 * 100 = 5%

To find the average percentage, we sum the percentages and divide by the number of cranes:
Average percentage = (14 + 20 + 5) / 3 = 39 / 3 = 13%

So, on average, the cranes are 13% taller than the buildings.

For the first crane:

Difference: 228 - 200 = 28 feet

Average height difference:
Average = (28 + 20 + 7) / 3 feet
Average = 55 feet / 3 feet ≈ 18.33 feet

Now, to find the average percentage taller the cranes are than the buildings:

To find the percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings, we need to calculate the difference in height for each crane and then find the average of these differences.

For the first crane:
Difference = Height of crane - Height of building = 228 - 200 = 28 feet

For the second crane:
Difference = Height of crane - Height of building = 120 - 100 = 20 feet

For the third crane:
Difference = Height of crane - Height of building = 147 - 140 = 7 feet

Now, let's find the total difference and the average difference by adding these differences and dividing by the number of cranes:

Total difference = 28 + 20 + 7 = 55 feet
Average difference = Total difference / Number of cranes = 55 / 3 ≈ 18.33 feet

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Percentage difference = Average difference * 100 = 18.33 * 100 ≈ 1833.33%

So, in total, the cranes are approximately 1833.33% taller than the buildings on average.

For the first crane:
Height of crane: 228 feet
Height of building: 200 feet
Difference in height: 228 - 200 = 28 feet
Percentage increase: (28/228) * 100 = 12.25%

3. For the final crane:
   - Height of crane: 147 feet
   - Height of building: 140 feet

Next, we calculate the height difference ratio for each crane and the building:

1. For the first crane:
   - Ratio: 28 / 200

2. For the second crane:
   - Ratio: 20 / 100

3. For the final crane:

2. For the second crane:
   - Percentage: (20 / 100) * 100 = 20%

3. For the final crane:
