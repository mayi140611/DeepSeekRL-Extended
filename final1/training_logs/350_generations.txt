system
To find out how many more rolls of wrapping paper Chandler needs to sell, we can subtract the number of rolls he has already sold from the total number of rolls he needs to sell.

Chandler needs to sell: 12 rolls

He has sold: 3 (to his grandmother) + 4 (to his uncle) + 3 (to a neighbor) = 10 rolls

Now, we can subtract the number of rolls he has sold from the total number of rolls he needs to sell:

12 (total rolls needed) - 10 (rolled sold) = 2 rolls

So, Chandler needs to sell 2 more rolls of wrapping paper.

system
To determine how many more rolls of wrapping paper Chandler needs to sell, we first need to find out how many rolls he has already sold in total:

- Sold to grandmother: 3 rolls
- Sold to uncle: 4 rolls
- Sold to a neighbor: 3 rolls

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[ 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 \]

Chandler has sold 10 rolls so far. He needs to sell 12 rolls in total. To find out how many more rolls he needs to sell, we subtract the number of rolls he has already sold from the total number of rolls required:

\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Chandler needs to sell 2 more rolls of wrapping paper.

First, we calculate the total number of rolls Chandler has already sold:

- 3 rolls to his grandmother
- 4 rolls to his uncle
- 3 rolls to a neighbor

Total sold so far = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 rolls

Chandler needs to sell a total of 12 rolls. To find out how many more rolls he needs to sell, we subtract the number of rolls he has already sold from the total number of rolls needed:

12 total rolls needed - 10 rolls sold so far = 2 rolls

Chandler needs to sell 2 more rolls of wrapping paper.

Chandler has sold a total of 3 rolls to his grandmother + 4 rolls to his uncle + 3 rolls to a neighbor = 10 rolls of wrapping paper.

To find out how many more rolls Chandler needs to sell, we subtract the number of rolls he has already sold from the total number of rolls he needs to sell.

12 rolls (total needed) - 10 rolls (already sold) = 2 rolls.

So, Chandler needs to sell 2 more rolls of wrapping paper.

To find out how many more rolls of wrapping paper Chandler needs to sell, we first add up the rolls he has already sold:
3 (to grandmother) + 4 (to uncle) + 3 (to neighbor) = 10 rolls.

Now we know Chandler needs to sell 12 rolls, and he has already sold 10 rolls. So we subtract the rolls he has sold from the total rolls he needs to sell:
12 (total rolls) - 10 (sold rolls) = 2 rolls.

Chandler needs to sell 2 more rolls of wrapping paper.

system
To find out how many more rolls of wrapping paper Chandler needs to sell, we first need to calculate the total number of rolls he has already sold. Let's add up the rolls sold to his grandmother, uncle, and neighbor.

Grandmother: 3 rolls
Uncle: 4 rolls
Neighbor: 3 rolls

Total sold = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 rolls

Chandler needs to sell 12 rolls in total. To find out how many more rolls he needs to sell, we subtract the number of rolls he has already sold from the total number of rolls he needs to sell.

Total rolls needed - Total rolls sold = More rolls needed to sell

12 rolls - 10 rolls = 2 rolls

Chandler needs to sell 2 more rolls of wrapping paper.
