system
First, calculate the total number of oranges: \(12 \text{ crates} \times 150 \text{ oranges/crate} = 1800 \text{ oranges}\).

Next, calculate the total number of nectarines: \(16 \text{ boxes} \times 30 \text{ nectarines/box} = 480 \text{ nectarines}\).

Finally, add the total number of oranges and nectarines to find the total number of fruits: \(1800 \text{ oranges} + 480 \text{ nectarines} = 2280 \text{ fruits}\).

The number of oranges in the crates is 12 crates * 150 oranges/crate = 1800 oranges. The number of nectarines in the boxes is 16 boxes * 30 nectarines/box = 480 nectarines. So the total number of fruits is 1800 oranges + 480 nectarines = 2280 pieces of fruit.

Each crate has 150 oranges, so the total number of oranges in all the crates is \(12 \times 150 = 1800\).

Each box holds 30 nectarines, so the total number of nectarines in all the boxes is \(16 \times 30 = 480\).

To find the total number of pieces of fruit, add the number of oranges in the crates and the number of nectarines in the boxes together: \(1800 + 480 = 2280\).

Each crate contains 150 oranges, so the total number of oranges is 12 crates * 150 oranges/crate = 1800 oranges.
Each box contains 30 nectarines, so the total number of nectarines is 16 boxes * 30 nectarines/box = 480 nectarines.
To find the total number of pieces of fruit, we add the number of oranges to the number of nectarines: 1800 oranges + 480 nectarines = 2280 pieces of fruit.
