The total area of the first two walls is \(2 \times 3 \times 2 = 12\) square meters. The area of the third wall is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) square meters. The area of the fourth wall is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) square meters. The total area is \(12 + 10 + 8 = 30\) square meters. Since each can of paint covers 2 square meters, Lucille needs \(30 / 2 = 15\) cans of paint.

First, we need to calculate the area of each wall. The area of a wall can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For each of the first two walls, the area is:

\[ \text{Area of first two walls} = 3 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ meters} = 6 \text{ square meters} \]

For the third wall, the area is:

\[ \text{Area of third wall} = 5 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ meters} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]

For the final wall, the area is:

\[ \text{Area of final wall} = 4 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ meters} = 8 \text{ square meters} \]

Now, we need to find the total area of all the walls combined:

\[ \text{Total area} = 6 \text{ square meters} + 10 \text{ square meters} + 8 \text{ square meters} = 24 \text{ square meters} \]

Each can of paint covers 2 square meters. Therefore, to find the number of cans of paint needed, we divide the total area by the coverage of one can of paint:

\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Coverage per can}} = \frac{24 \text{ square meters}}{2 \text{ square meters per can}} = 12 \text{ cans} \]

So, Lucille needs 12 cans of paint.

To determine how many cans of paint Lucille needs, we first calculate the total area of the walls that will be painted. We start by finding the area of each wall:

- The two walls are 3 meters wide and 2 meters tall, so each of these walls has an area of \(3 \text{ m} \times 2 \text{ m} = 6 \text{ m}^2\). Since there are two such walls, their total area is \(2 \times 6 \text{ m}^2 = 12 \text{ m}^2\).

- The third wall is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall, so its area is \(5 \text{ m} \times 2 \text{ m} = 10 \text{ m}^2\).

- The fourth wall is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall, so its area is \(4 \text{ m} \times 2 \text{ m} = 8 \text{ m}^2\).

Adding these areas together gives the total area of the walls to be painted:
\[12 \text{ m}^2 + 10 \text{ m}^2 + 8 \text{ m}^2 = 30 \text{ m}^2.\]

Since each can of paint covers 2 square meters, we need to divide the total area by the coverage of one can of paint to find out how many cans are required:
\[\frac{30 \text{ m}^2}{2 \text{ m}^2/\text{can}} = 15 \text{ cans}.\]

Therefore, Lucille needs 15 cans of paint.

Each wall covers \(3 \times 2 = 6\) square meters. There are two walls of this size, so they cover \(2 \times 6 = 12\) square meters. The third and fourth wall cover \(5 \times 2 = 10\) square meters, giving a total of \(12 + 10 = 22\) square meters to paint. Since each can covers 2 square meters, Lucille will need \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\) cans of paint.

To determine how many cans of paint Lucille needs, we first calculate the total area she needs to paint. Since each wall is a rectangle, we can find the area of each wall by multiplying its width by its height.

For the first two walls (two walls of 3 meters by 2 meters):
\[ 3 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ meters} = 6 \text{ square meters per wall} \]
Since there are two such walls:
\[ 6 \text{ square meters} \times 2 = 12 \text{ square meters} \]

For the third wall (5 meters wide and 2 meters tall):
\[ 5 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ meters} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]

For the final wall (4 meters wide and 2 meters tall):
\[ 4 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ meters} = 8 \text{ square meters} \]

Now we sum up the total area of all the walls:
\[ 12 \text{ square meters} + 10 \text{ square meters} + 8 \text{ square meters} = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

Each can of paint covers 2 square meters. To find out how many cans of paint are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage per can:
\[ 30 \text{ square meters} \div 2 \text{ square meters per can} = 15 \text{ cans} \]

Therefore, Lucille needs 15 cans of paint.

To determine how many cans of paint Lucille needs, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls she is painting. 

The area of the first two walls (each with dimensions 3 meters wide by 2 meters tall) is:
\[3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ square meters}\]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for these two walls is:
\[2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ square meters}\]

Now, we add up the areas of all four walls to get the total area:
\[12 + 10 + 8 = 30 \text{ square meters}\]

Since each can of paint covers 2 square meters, the number of cans of paint needed is:
\[30 \div 2 = 15\]

To find the total square meters covered by the walls, we multiply the width and height of each wall to get the area. Two walls are 3 meters wide and 2 meters tall, so each wall is 3*2 = 6 square meters. The third wall is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall, so it is 5*2 = 10 square meters. The final wall is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall, so it is 4*2 = 8 square meters. Adding these together, the total area is 6+10+8 = 24 square meters. Since each can of paint covers 2 square meters, Lucille needs 24/2 = 12 cans of paint.

First, calculate the area of each wall. The area of a wall is given by the formula: length * width.

For the two walls that are 3 meters wide and 2 meters tall, the area of each is 3 * 2 = 6 square meters. Therefore, for two walls, the total area is 6 * 2 = 12 square meters.

For the third wall that is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall, the area is 5 * 2 = 10 square meters.

For the final wall that is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall, the area is 4 * 2 = 8 square meters.

Now, add up the areas of all the walls to get the total area that needs to be painted: 12 + 10 + 8 = 30 square meters.

Since each can of paint covers 2 square meters, you will need 30 / 2 = 15 cans of paint.

To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and then add them together.

The first two walls have a length of 3 meters and a height of 2 meters, so their area is 3 * 2 = 6 square meters each. Since there are two such walls, their combined area is 6 * 2 = 12 square meters.

The third wall is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall, so its area is 5 * 2 = 10 square meters.

The final wall is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall, so its area is 4 * 2 = 8 square meters.

Now we add all the areas together: 12 + 10 + 8 = 30 square meters.

Since each can of paint covers 2 square meters, Lucille will need 30 / 2 = 15 cans of paint.

To calculate the total area that needs to be painted, we first find the area of each wall and then sum them up.

For the first two walls:
Area = width x height
Area of first two walls = 3 m x 2 m = 6 m²

For the third wall:
Area = width x height
Area of third wall = 5 m x 2 m = 10 m²

For the fourth wall:
Area = width x height
Area of fourth wall = 4 m x 2 m = 8 m²

Now we sum the areas:

Total area to be painted = 6 m² + 10 m² + 8 m² = 24 m²

Each can of paint covers 2 square meters, so to calculate the number of cans required:

Number of cans needed = Total area / Area covered by one can
Number of cans needed = 24 m² / 2 m² = 12 cans

Therefore, Lucille needs 12 cans of paint.

To solve this, let's calculate the area of each wall:

1. First wall: 3 meters wide * 2 meters tall = 6 square meters
2. Second wall: 3 meters wide * 2 meters tall = 6 square meters
3. Third wall: 5 meters wide * 2 meters tall = 10 square meters
4. Fourth wall: 4 meters wide * 2 meters tall = 8 square meters

Now, let's add up all the areas of the walls:

Total area = 6 + 6 + 10 + 8 = 30 square meters

Since each can of paint covers 2 square meters, we need to divide the total area by the coverage of one can:

Number of cans = Total area / Coverage per can = 30 / 2 = 15 cans

Therefore, Lucille needs 15 cans of paint.

To calculate the total area of the walls that Lucille needs to paint, we multiply the width by the height for each wall and then sum the areas of all the walls.

Area of the first two walls:
\[2 \times 3 \times 2 = 12 \text{ square meters each}\]
So, for two walls of these dimensions, the total area is:
\[12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ square meters}\]

Area of the third wall:
\[5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ square meters}\]

Area of the fourth wall:
\[4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ square meters}\]

Now, we add the areas of all the walls together:
\[24 + 10 + 8 = 42 \text{ square meters}\]

Each can of paint covers 2 square meters, so to find out how many cans of paint Lucille needs, we divide the total area by the coverage of one can:
\[42 \div 2 = 21 \text{ cans}\]

Therefore, Lucille needs 21 cans of paint.

To find the total area that Lucille needs to paint, we first calculate the area of each wall and then sum them up.

For the two walls that are 3 meters wide and 2 meters tall:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 3 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 6 \, \text{m}^2 \]
Since there are two such walls, their total area is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \, \text{m}^2 = 12 \, \text{m}^2 \]

The third wall is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 5 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{m}^2 \]

The final wall is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 4 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 8 \, \text{m}^2 \]

Now, summing up all the wall areas:
\[ 12 \, \text{m}^2 + 10 \, \text{m}^2 + 8 \, \text{m}^2 = 30 \, \text{m}^2 \]

Each can of paint covers 2 square meters, so to find out how many cans Lucille needs:
\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Area covered by one can}} = \frac{30 \, \text{m}^2}{2 \, \text{m}^2/\text{can}} = 15 \, \text{cans} \]
