84
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
Brendan can initially cut 8 yards of grass per day. After buying the lawnmower, his production capacity increases by 50%, which means he can cut \(8 \times (1 + 0.5) = 8 \times 1.5 = 12\) yards per day. 

After a week, which is 7 days, the total number of yards he can cut is \(12 \times 7\).
</reasoning>
<answer>
12 \times 7 = 84

The answer is 84.

<reasoning>
To determine how many yards Brendan will cut after a week with his newly bought lawnmower, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cutting Capacity**: Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day without a lawnmower.
2. **Increase in Cutting Capacity**: The lawnmower increases his cutting capacity by 50%. 
   \[
   \text{Increase in yards} = 8 \times \frac{50}{100} = 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ yards per day}
   \]
3. **Total Cutting Capacity with Lawnmower**: 
   \[
   \text{Total yards per day} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ yards per day}
   \]
4. **Yards Cut in a Week**: Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily capacity by 7:
   \[
   \text{Yards in a week} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ yards}
   \]

Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day. After acquiring a lawnmower, he is able to cut 50% more grass per day. 50% of 8 yards is 4 yards. This means that with the lawnmower, Brendan can now cut 8 + 4 = 12 yards of grass per day. 
In a week, there are 7 days. Multiplying the daily cuttings by 7 gives the total cuttings over a week. So, 12 * 7 = 84 yards. 

Therefore, Brendan will be able to cut 84 yards of grass after a week.

First, we need to determine the additional yards Brendan can cut per day after buying the lawnmower, which is 50% more than the original amount. The original amount is 8 yards per day, so the additional amount is 50/100 * 8 = 4 yards per day. Therefore, the total amount Brendan can cut per day now is 8 + 4 = 12 yards per day.

Now, to find out how many yards Brendan will be able to cut after a week, we need to multiply the total amount he cuts per day by the number of days in a week, which is 7. So, the total yards cut after a week is 12 * 7 = 84 yards.

First, we need to determine how many yards Brendan can cut per day without the lawnmower. According to the problem, Brendan can cut 8 yards per day.

With the lawnmower, it helps him to cut more yards by 50% per day. This means he can cut \(8 + (8 \times 0.5) = 8 + 4 = 12\) yards per day with the lawnmower.

Next, we need to calculate how many yards he can cut in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so if Brendan can cut 12 yards per day with the lawnmower, then in a week he can cut \(12 \times 7 = 84\) yards.

First, we need to determine how many yards Brendan can cut per day after purchasing the lawnmower. According to the problem, the lawnmower helped him cut the yards by 50%.

To calculate the additional yards Brendan can cut per day with the lawnmower, we multiply his original rate of 8 yards by the 50% increase. This gives us an additional 4 yards per day.

By adding these additional yards to his original rate, we get the total number of yards Brendan can cut per day with the lawnmower. This equals 8 + 4 = 12 yards per day.

Next, to find out how many yards Brendan can cut after a week, we multiply the number of days in a week (7) by the total yards he can cut per day (12 yards). This gives us 7 * 12 = 84 yards.

Therefore, after a week, Brendan will be able to cut 84 yards of grass.

To determine how many yards Brendan will be able to cut after a week, we need to calculate his increased daily cutting capacity after purchasing the lawnmower, and then multiply by the number of days in a week (7).

Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day initially.
With the new lawnmower, he can cut 50% more, which means he can now cut an additional 8 * 0.50 = 4 yards per day. So, his new daily capacity is 8 + 4 = 12 yards.

Now, to find out how many yards he will cut in a week, we multiply his daily capacity by the number of days in a week: 12 yards/day * 7 days/week = 84 yards/week.

To determine how many yards Brendan will be able to cut after a week, we need to take into account the increase in his cutting capacity after he bought the lawnmower. After purchasing the lawnmower, Brendan can cut 8 yards per day plus an additional 50% of 8 yards per day, which is 4 yards per day. Therefore, the total number of yards he can cut per day is 8 + 4 = 12 yards. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of yards he will be able to cut in a week by multiplying the number of yards he can cut per day by 7.

The calculation is as follows:
12 yards/day * 7 days/week = 84 yards/week

To determine how many yards of grass Brendan can cut in a week with his new lawnmower, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yards Brendan can cut per day without the lawnmower.
2. Determine the increase in the number of yards that Brendan can cut per day with the lawnmower.
3. Find out how many yards Brendan can cut per day with the lawnmower.
4. Calculate how manyyards Brendan will be able to cut in a week if he continues to increase his daily yardage at the same rate.

The original rate of cutting grass is 8 yards per day. With the lawnmower, he can cut 50% more grass per day, which means he can cut an additional 8 * 50% = 4 yards per day.

So, with the lawnmower, Brendan can cut 8 (original rate) + 4 (additional yards) = 12 yards per day.

To find out how many yards Brendan can cut in a week, we multiply the number of yards he can cut per day by 7 days. 

12 yards/day * 7 days/week = 84 yards/week

So, with his lawnmower, Brendan can cut 84 yards of grass in a week.

To determine how many yards Brendan can cut after a week with his lawnmower, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased amount of yards Brendan can cut per day after buying the lawnmower.
2. Determine the total number of yards Brendan can cut in a week.

Firstly, Brendan can cut 8 yards per day without the lawnmower. With the lawnmower, he can cut 50% more yards per day. Therefore, the increased amount of yards per day is:
\[ 8 \text{ yards/day} \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ yards/day} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of yards Brendan can cut in a week. Since he cuts the same amount each day and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of yards per week is:
\[ 12 \text{ yards/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 84 \text{ yards/week} \]

So, Brendan will be able to cut 84 yards after a week.

To determine how many yards Brendan can cut after a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional yards Brendan can cut per day after buying the lawnmower.
2. Determine the total yards Brendan can cut per day after the lawnmower purchase.
3. Calculate the total yards Brendan will cut in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the additional yards Brendan can cut per day.**
Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day. With the lawnmower, he can cut 50% more.
\[ 8 \text{ yards} \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ yards} \]
So, Brendan can cut 4 additional yards per day.

**Step 2: Determine the total yards Brendan can cut per day after the lawnmower purchase.**
\[ 8 \text{ yards} + 4 \text{ yards} = 12 \text{ yards per day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total yards Brendan will cut in a week.**
There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 12 \text{ yards/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ yards} \]

**Conclusion**: Brendan will be able to cut 84 yards of grass in a week.

Brendan's original daily cutting capacity is 8 yards. With the help of the lawnmower, he can cut 50% more yards per day. To find out how many additional yards the lawnmower can help with, we multiply the original capacity by the percentage increase: \(8 \times 0.50 = 4\). This tells us that with the lawnmower, Brendan will now be able to cut 4 more yards per day.

Adding this to his original capacity, Brendan will now be able to cut \(8 + 4 = 12\) yards per day. To find out how many yards he can cut in a week (7 days), we multiply his daily capacity by 7: \(12 \times 7 = 84\) yards.

This calculation assumes that the lawnmower is used continuously throughout the week and does not affect his capacity on days when he doesn't use the lawnmower.
