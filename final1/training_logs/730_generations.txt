###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Chang's Garden has two kinds of apples. Sweet ones and sour ones. He can sell the sweet ones for $.5 an apple. The sour ones sell for $.1 an apple. 75% of the apples he gets are sweet and the rest are sour. If he earns $40, how many apples did his trees give him?

<reasoning>
Let's denote the total number of apples as \( x \).

First, since 75% of the apples are sweet, the number of sweet apples \( S \) would be:
\[ S = 0.75x \]

The remaining 25% would be sour, so the number of sour apples \( R \) would be:
\[ R = 0.25x \]

Chang can sell the sweet apples for $0.5 each and the sour apples for $0.1 each.

The total revenue \( R_{total} \) from selling the apples can be expressed as:
\[ R_{total} = S \times 0.5 + R \times 0.1 \]

Substituting the values of \( S \) and \( R \):
\[ R_{total} = 0.75x \times 0.5 + 0.25x \times 0.1 \]

\[ R_{total} = 0.375x + 0.025x \]

\[ R_{total} = 0.395x \]

Given that the total revenue earned is $40, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.395x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.395} \]

\[ x = 100.75 \]

Since the number of apples must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number:
\[ x \approx 101 \]

Therefore, Chang's trees gave him approximately 101 apples.

Let's denote the total number of apples as \( A \). According to the problem, 75% of the apples are sweet, which means 25% are sour. This can be expressed as \( 0.25A \) for sour apples and \( 0.75A \) for sweet apples.

The earnings from selling the sweet apples are \( 0.5 \times 0.75A = 0.375A \) dollars, and the earnings from selling the sour apples are \( 0.1 \times 0.25A = 0.025A \) dollars. 

The total earnings from selling all apples is given as $40. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.375A + 0.025A = 40 \]
Combining like terms gives:
\[ 0.4A = 40 \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]
So, the total number of apples Chang's Garden has is 100.

Let's denote the total number of apples Chang gets as \( x \). According to the problem, 75% of the apples are sweet, which means 25% are sour. 

The price of each sweet apple is $0.5, and the price of each sour apple is $0.1. The total earnings from the sweet apples are \( 0.5x \), and from the sour apples, it is \( 0.1(0.25x) \). Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated as:
\[ 0.5x + 0.1(0.25x) = 40 \]

Let's simplify this equation:
\[ 0.5x + 0.025x = 40 \]
\[ 0.525x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.525:
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.525} \]

We can perform this calculation using a calculator:
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.525} \approx 75.56 \]

Since the number of apples must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 76. Therefore, Chang had approximately 76 apples.

However, let's verify if 75 or 76 apples fit the logic directly:
- 75 apples would give \( 75 \times 0.5 = 37.5 \) from sweet apples, and \( 75 \times 0.1 = 7.5 \) from sour apples. Total earnings would be \( 37.5 + 7.5 = 45 \), which is too high.
- 76 apples would give \( 76 \times 0.5 = 38 \) from sweet apples, and \( 76 \times 0.1 = 7.6 \) from sour apples. Total earnings would be \( 38 + 7.6 = 45.6 \), which is very close to $40.

Since 76 apples give close to $40, we can conclude that 76 apples is a very good approximation.

Therefore, Chang's trees gave him approximately 76 apples.

Let's denote the total number of apples Chang's Garden grows as \( N \). According to the problem, 75% of the apples are sweet and the rest are sour. This means that \( 0.75N \) is the number of sweet apples and \( 0.25N \) is the number of sour apples.

The price of a sweet apple is $0.5, and the price of a sour apple is $0.1. Given that Chang earns $40 from selling all the apples, we can set up the following equation to represent this:

\[ 0.75N \times 0.5 + 0.25N \times 0.1 = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 0.375N + 0.025N = 40 \]
\[ 0.4N = 40 \]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:
\[ N = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ N = 100 \]

Therefore, Chang's Garden grew 100 apples in total.

Let's denote the total number of apples Chang's Garden has as \( x \).
Since 75% of the apples are sweet, the number of sweet apples is \( 0.75x \).
The remaining 25% are sour, so the number of sour apples is \( 0.25x \).

The selling price of the sweet apples is $0.5 per apple, and the sweet apples yield a total of \( 0.5 \times 0.75x = 0.375x \).

The selling price of the sour apples is $0.1 per apple, and the sour apples yield a total of \( 0.1 \times 0.25x = 0.025x \).

Adding these, the total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 0.375x + 0.025x = 0.4x \]

Given that the earnings are $40, we set up the equation:
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):

Therefore, Chang's Garden has 100 apples in total.

To determine the total number of apples Chang's Garden received, we need to set up an equation that accounts for the earnings from both sweet and sour apples. Let's define the variables and work through the problem step by step.

Let \( x \) be the total number of apples. According to the problem, 75% of the apples are sweet, so the remaining 25% are sour. Therefore, the number of sweet apples is \( 0.75x \) and the number of sour apples is \( 0.25x \).

The rate at which the sweet apples are sold is $0.5 per apple, and the rate for the sour apples is $0.1 per apple. Therefore, the total earnings from the sweet apples are \( 0.5 \times 0.75x = 0.375x \), and the total earnings from the sour apples are \( 0.1 \times 0.25x = 0.025x \).

The total earnings from both types of apples is given as $40. Thus, we can set up the following equation:

\[
0.375x + 0.025x = 40
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
0.4x = 40
\]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 0.4:

\[
x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100
\]

Therefore, the total number of apples is 100.

Let's denote the total number of apples Chang's Garden received as \( A \).

Given that 75% of the apples are sweet, this means 25% of the apples are sour.

The price for each sweet apple is $0.5, and the price for each sour apple is $0.1.

Using these information, we can write the equation based on the total earnings from these apples:

Total earnings = Number of sweet apples * Price per sweet apple + Number of sour apples * Price per sour apple

Total earnings = \( 0.75A \times 0.5 + 0.25A \times 0.1 \)

Simplifying this equation:

Total earnings = \( 0.375A + 0.025A \)

Combining like terms:

Total earnings = \( 0.4A \)

Given that the total earnings are $40, we can now solve for \( A \):

\( 0.4A = 40 \)

Dividing both sides by 0.4:

A = \( \frac{40}{0.4} \)

A = 100

Therefore, Chang's Garden received 100 apples.
