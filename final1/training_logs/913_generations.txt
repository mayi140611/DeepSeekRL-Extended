system
<reasoning>
In one minute, Matt climbs 6 feet. In 7 minutes, Matt will have climbed \( 6 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ feet} \).

Jason can climb 12 feet per minute, so in 7 minutes, Jason will have climbed \( 12 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 84 \text{ feet} \).

After 7 minutes, Jason will be \( 84 \text{ feet} - 42 \text{ feet} = 42 \text{ feet} \) higher than Matt.

To find out how much higher Jason will be than Matt after 7 minutes, we need to calculate how much each of them has climbed.

First, let's calculate how far Matt climbs in 7 minutes:
- Matt climbs at a rate of 6 feet per minute.
- In 7 minutes, Matt will climb \( 6 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ feet} \).

Next, let's calculate how far Jason climbs in 7 minutes:
- Jason climbs at a rate of 12 feet per minute.
- In 7 minutes, Jason will climb \( 12 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 84 \text{ feet} \).

Now we need to find the difference between Jason's climbing distance and Matt's climbing distance:
- The difference is \( 84 \text{ feet} - 42 \text{ feet} = 42 \text{ feet} \).

Therefore, Jason will be 42 feet higher than Matt.

Jason's climbing speed is 12 feet per minute, and Matt's is 6 feet per minute. In 7 minutes, Jason's additional height gain will be:
\[ 12 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 84 \text{ feet} \]

Matt's additional height gain will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ feet} \]

Jason's total height gain will be 84 feet, and Matt's total height gain will be 42 feet. Therefore, the difference in their heights after 7 minutes will be:
\[ 84 \text{ feet} - 42 \text{ feet} = 42 \text{ feet} \]

To determine how much higher Jason will be than Matt after 7 minutes, we need to calculate the distance each of them climbs in that time.

First, we'll find the distance Matt climbs in 7 minutes:
- Matt climbs at a rate of 6 feet per minute.
- In 7 minutes, Matt will climb: 
  \[
  6 \, \text{feet/minute} \times 7 \, \text{minutes} = 42 \, \text{feet}
  \]

Next, we calculate the distance Jason climbs in 7 minutes:
- Jason climbs at a rate of 12 feet per minute.
- In 7 minutes, Jason will climb:
  \[
  12 \, \text{feet/minute} \times 7 \, \text{minutes} = 84 \, \text{feet}
  \]

Now, to find how much higher Jason is than Matt after 7 minutes, we subtract the distance Matt climbs from the distance Jason climbs:
  \[
  84 \, \text{feet} - 42 \, \text{feet} = 42 \, \text{feet}
  \]

Therefore, after 7 minutes, Jason will be 42 feet higher than Matt.

First, let's determine how high Matt can climb in 7 minutes. Since Matt climbs at a rate of 6 feet per minute, in 7 minutes he will have climbed:
\[ 6 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's determine how high Jason can climb in the same 7 minutes. Since Jason climbs at a rate of 12 feet per minute, in 7 minutes he will have climbed:
\[ 12 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 84 \text{ feet} \]

To find out how much higher Jason will be than Matt after 7 minutes, we subtract the height Matt has climbed from the height Jason has climbed:
\[ 84 \text{ feet} - 42 \text{ feet} = 42 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, after 7 minutes, Jason will be 42 feet higher than Matt.

To determine how much higher Jason will be than Matt after 7 minutes, we need to calculate their respective heights after 7 minutes and then find the difference between their heights.

Matt's height after 7 minutes:
\[ \text{Matt's height} = \text{Matt's climbing speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ feet} \]

Jason's height after 7 minutes:
\[ \text{Jason's height} = \text{Jason's climbing speed} \times \text{Time} = 12 \text{ feet/minute} \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 84 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find out how much higher Jason is than Matt:
\[ \text{Difference in height} = \text{Jason's height} - \text{Matt's height} = 84 \text{ feet} - 42 \text{ feet} = 42 \text{ feet} \]

So Jason will be 42 feet higher than his friend Matt after 7 minutes.

First, we need to determine how far each person has climbed after 7 minutes. 

Matt climbs at a rate of 6 feet per minute, so in 7 minutes he will have climbed:

Jason climbs at a rate of 12 feet per minute, so in 7 minutes he will have climbed:

To find out how much higher Jason is than Matt after 7 minutes, we subtract Matt's height from Jason's height:

First, we need to calculate how far each person has climbed after 7 minutes.
For Matt: Matt climbs 6 feet per minute. So after 7 minutes, Matt climbs \(6 \times 7 = 42\) feet.
For Jason: Jason climbs 12 feet per minute. So after 7 minutes, Jason climbs \(12 \times 7 = 84\) feet.
To find out how much higher Jason is than Matt, we subtract Matt's distance from Jason's distance: \(84 - 42 = 42\).

Therefore, after 7 minutes, Jason will be 42 feet higher than his friend Matt.

To determine how much higher Jason will be than Matt after 7 minutes, we need to calculate the height each of them can climb in that time period.

First, we calculate Matt's height in 7 minutes:
\[ \text{Matt's height} = \text{Speed of Matt} \times \text{Time} = 6 \, \text{feet/minute} \times 7 \, \text{minutes} = 42 \, \text{feet} \]

Next, we calculate Jason's height in 7 minutes:
\[ \text{Jason's height} = \text{Speed of Jason} \times \text{Time} = 12 \, \text{feet/minute} \times 7 \, \text{minutes} = 84 \, \text{feet} \]

To find out how much higher Jason is than Matt, we subtract Matt's height from Jason's height:
\[ \text{Height difference} = \text{Jason's height} - \text{Matt's height} = 84 \, \text{feet} - 42 \, \text{feet} = 42 \, \text{feet} \]

Therefore, after 7 minutes, Jason will be 42 feet higher than Matt.

Jason can climb 12 feet per minute and Matt can climb 6 feet per minute. After 7 minutes, Jason's height gain will be 12 feet/minute * 7 minutes = 84 feet, and Matt's height gain will be 6 feet/minute * 7 minutes = 42 feet. To find out how much higher Jason will be than Matt after 7 minutes, we subtract Matt's height gain from Jason's height gain: 84 feet - 42 feet = 42 feet.
