Initially, John has 40 light bulbs. He uses 16 of them, so he has \(40 - 16 = 24\) light bulbs left.

Next, he gives half of the remaining bulbs to a friend. Half of 24 is \(24 / 2 = 12\).

Therefore, after giving away 12 bulbs, John has \(24 - 12 = 12\) light bulbs left.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine how many light bulbs John has left, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. John starts with 40 light bulbs.
2. He uses 16 of them. So, the number of light bulbs left after he uses some is:
   \[
   40 - 16 = 24
   \]
3. John then gives half of the remaining light bulbs to a friend. Half of 24 is:
   \[
   \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]
4. After giving away 12 light bulbs, the number of light bulbs John has left is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

So, John has 12 light bulbs left.
