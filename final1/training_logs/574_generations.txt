#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
John ate half of the 3 servings of candy, which means he ate 3 / 2 = 1.5 servings.

Since each serving has 120 calories, the total calories John ate is 1.5 servings * 120 calories/serving = 180 calories.

To find out how many calories John ate, we need to first determine the total number of calories in the entire package and then find out how many calories half of that represents.

1. The package has 3 servings, each with 120 calories. So, the total number of calories in the package is:
   \[
   3 \text{ servings} \times 120 \text{ calories/serving} = 360 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. John eats half of the package. So, the number of calories in half the package is:
   \[
   \frac{360 \text{ calories}}{2} = 180 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, John ate 180 calories.

To determine how many calories John ate, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the entire package.
2. Determine how many calories are in half of the package.

First, we know that the package has 3 servings, each with 120 calories. So, the total number of calories in the entire package is:
\[ 3 \text{ servings} \times 120 \text{ calories per serving} = 360 \text{ calories} \]

Next, since John eats half the package, we need to find half of the total number of calories:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ calories}}{2} = 180 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the number of calories John ate is:
\[ 180 \text{ calories} \]

To determine how many calories John consumed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the entire package.
2. Find out how many calories are in half of the package.

First, the total number of calories in the entire package is calculated by multiplying the number of servings by the calories per serving:
\[
3 \text{ servings} \times 120 \text{ calories/serving} = 360 \text{ calories}
\]

Since John eats half the package, he consumes half of the total calories:
\[
\frac{360 \text{ calories}}{2} = 180 \text{ calories}
\]

Thus, John ate \(\boxed{180}\) calories.

To determine how many calories John ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of servings in the package:**
   The package has 3 servings.

2. **Calculate the total number of calories in the package:**
   Each serving has 120 calories.
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = 3 \text{ servings} \times 120 \text{ calories/serving} = 360 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Determine how many servings John ate:**
   John eats half of the package.
   \[
   \text{Servings John ate} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ servings}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of calories in the servings John ate:**
   Each serving has 120 calories.
   \[
   \text{Calories John ate} = 1.5 \text{ servings} \times 120 \text{ calories/serving} = 180 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, John ate 180 calories.

To calculate how many calories John consumed, we start by determining the total number of calories in the whole package. The package has 3 servings with 120 calories each, so the total calories per package is:

\[ 3 \text{ servings} \times 120 \text{ calories per serving} = 360 \text{ calories} \]

Since John eats half the package, we calculate half of the total calories:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ calories}}{2} = 180 \text{ calories} \]

So, John ate 180 calories.

To find out how many calories John ate, we need to calculate the total number of calories in the entire package and then divide by 2 because he only ate half of it.

The package has 3 servings with 120 calories each, so the total number of calories in the package is:
3 servings * 120 calories/serving = 360 calories

Since John ate half the package, we need to divide the total by 2:
360 calories / 2 = 180 calories

So, John ate 180 calories.

To find out how many calories John ate, we need to first calculate the total number of calories in the package and then determine half of that amount.

1. Calculate the total calories in the package:
   Total calories = Number of servings × Calories per serving
   
   Total calories = 3 × 120 = 360 calories
   
2. Calculate how many calories John ate:
   Calories John ate = Total calories / 2
   
   Calories John ate = 360 / 2 = 180 calories
