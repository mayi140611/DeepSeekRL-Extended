<reasoning>
Jack bought 3 books a month for $20 each, so in one year, he bought 3 * 12 = 36 books. The total cost of buying the books in one year is 36 * $20 = $720. Jack sold them back for $500. Therefore, he lost $720 - $500 = $220.

Jack buys 3 books each month for $20, so he spends 3 * $20 = $60 per month. Over a year, he spends $60 * 12 = $720.

At the end of the year, he sells back the books for $500. Therefore, the loss is $720 - $500 = $220.

system
<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the total amount Jack spent on buying the books. Since he bought 3 books each month, we can calculate this as follows:
\[3 \text{ books/month} \times \$20 \text{ per book} = \$60 \text{ per month}\]

Since this happens every month for 12 months, the total amount spent on books is:
\[\$60 \times 12 \text{ months} = \$720\]

Next, we consider the amount of money Jack received when he sold the books. He sold them back for $500.

To find out how much money Jack lost, we need to subtract the amount received from the total amount spent:
\[\$720 - \$500 = \$220\]

Therefore, Jack lost $220.

Jack bought 3 books every month for 12 months, which means he bought 3 * 12 = 36 books in total. Each book costs $20, so he spent 36 * $20 = $720 on the books. At the end of the year, he sold the books back for $500. Therefore, he lost $720 - $500 = $220.

First, determine the total cost of books bought in a year. Jack buys 3 books per month at a price of $20 each. There are 12 months in a year, so the total cost of books is 3 books/month * $20/book * 12 months = $720.

Next, subtract the money he received from selling the books from the total cost of the books. Thus, the amount of money Jack lost is $720 (total cost) - $500 (money received) = $220.

First, let's calculate how much Jack spent on buying the books. He bought 3 books each month for 12 months, so he bought a total of 3 * 12 = 36 books. Each book cost $20, so his total spending was 36 * $20 = $720.

Next, we know that Jack sold the books back at the end of the year for $500.

To find out how much money Jack lost, we subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent: $720 - $500 = $220.

Therefore, Jack lost $220.

<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the total cost of the books that Jack bought during the year. Since Jack buys 3 books each month at $20 each, he spends $20 x 3 = $60 each month. In a year, which has 12 months, he spends $60 x 12 = $720 on books.

Next, we need to calculate the total value of the books he sold at the end of the year. He sold them back for $500.

Now, we can determine the net loss by subtracting the value of the sold books from the total value of the books he bought. The net loss is $720 - $500 = $220.

So, Jack lost $220 in the year.

Jack buys 3 books a month for $20 each, so if he buys books for a year (12 months), he buys a total of 3 * 12 = 36 books. The total cost for buying books is 36 * $20 = $720.

At the end of the year, he sells all the books for $500. The amount of money he lost is the total cost minus the money he got: $720 - $500 = $220.

To determine how much money Jack lost, we need to calculate both the total amount he spent on buying the books and the total amount he earned from selling them back.

1. Calculate the total cost of buying the books:
   Jack bought 3 books per month and each book costs $20.
   Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost is:
   \[
   3 \text{ books/month} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} \times 12 \text{ months} = 720 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount earned from selling the books:
   Jack sold the books back for $500.

3. Determine the loss:
   Subtract the total amount earned from the total amount spent:
   \[
   720 \text{ dollars} - 500 \text{ dollars} = 220 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Jack lost $220.

To determine how much money Jack lost, we need to calculate his total expenditure on buying books and deduct the amount he received from selling them back. Here are the steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of buying books: Jack buys 3 books a month for a year, so he buys \(3 \times 12 = 36\) books. Each book costs $20, so the total cost is \(36 \times 20 = \$720\).
2. Calculate the money received from selling the books: Jack received $500 from selling the books back.

Now, we can find out the loss by subtracting the money received from the total cost:
\[ \text{Loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Money received} = 720 - 500 = \$220 \]

Therefore, Jack lost $220.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the books that Jack bought. He bought 3 books a month, and each book costs $20. Therefore, the monthly cost is $20 * 3 = $60. Since he bought books for 12 months, his total cost is $60 * 12 = $720.

Next, we need to account for the money he got back from selling the books. He sold them back for $500.
To find out how much money he lost, we subtract the money he got back from the total cost: $720 - $500 = $220.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jack spent on the books over the course of a year. Since he bought 3 books each month at a price of $20, he would have spent $20 * 3 = $60 every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total amount he would have spent is $60 * 12 = $720.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jack made from selling the books back. He sold them for $500.

Now, we need to find the difference between what he spent and what he made:
$720 (total spent) - $500 (total made) = $220 loss.

Therefore, Jack lost $220.

To determine how much money Jack lost, we need to calculate his total expenditure and compare it to his total income. First, we calculate the total cost of the books he bought.

Jack buys 3 books a month at $20 each. There are 12 months in a year, so the total cost for the year is:
\[ 3 \text{ books/month} \times $20/\text{book} \times 12 \text{ months} = $720 \]

Next, we subtract the value of the books he sold back at the end of the year:
\[ $500 \]

The money lost by Jack is:
\[ $720 - $500 = $220 \]

Therefore, Jack lost a total of $220.

To determine how much money Jack lost, we need to calculate both the total amount of money he spent on buying books and the total amount he recovers from selling them back.

First, let's calculate the cost of the books Jack bought:
- He bought 3 books each month.
- Each book costs $20.
- There are 12 months in a year.

Total cost:
\[
3 \text{ books/month} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} \times 12 \text{ months} = 3 \times 20 \times 12 = 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out the total amount he recovers from selling the books:
- He sells them back for $500.

Total worth recovered:
\[
500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, to find out the net loss:
\[
\text{Total loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total recovered} = 72 \text{ dollars} - 500 \text{ dollars} = -428 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Jack lost $428.
