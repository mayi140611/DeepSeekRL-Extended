###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Jeff spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up with his Facebook pals as he does working. Monday through Friday, however, he spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up. If he spends 3 hours every day catching up, how many hours does he spend working in an entire week?

system
Let's denote the number of hours Jeff spends catching up with his Facebook pals each day as \( C \). According to the problem, Jeff spends 3 hours every day catching up, so \( C = 3 \) hours. On the weekends, Jeff spends three times as many hours catching up as he does working. Let's denote the number of hours he spends working on the weekend as \( W_{\text{weekend}} \). Therefore, \( W_{\text{weekend}} = 3W_{\text{weekend}} \). This means he spends \( 3W_{\text{weekend}} \) hours working on the weekend, and on a typical day, he spends \( 4 \times 3W_{\text{weekend}} = 12W_{\text{weekend}} \) hours working. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours he spends working in a week is \( 12W_{\text{weekend}} + 3 \times 3 \times 7 = 12W_{\text{weekend}} + 63 \). 

However, we can simplify our approach by directly calculating the total hours worked in a week. He works 5 weekdays, so he works \( 5 \times 12W_{\text{weekend}} = 60W_{\text{weekend}} \) hours. This can be further simplified by recognizing that his total weekly working hours are related to his weekend working hours. Since he spends three times as much time catching up as working each day, his total weekly working hours are directly related to how much he works each day. Thus, his total weekly working hours are computed as:

Total working hours = \(5 \times 12W_{\text{weekend}} = 60W_{\text{weekend}}\).

Without more specific information about the actual number of hours spent working on weekends, we express the total weekly working hours in terms of \( W_{\text{weekend}} \), the number of hours he works on the weekend. 

The total time Jeff spends working in an entire week is \(12W_{\text{weekend}} + 105\), where 105 is the total time he spends working on weekdays.

Since \( W_{\text{weekend}} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours (he spends 3 hours each day), we substitute to find:

\( 12W_{\text{weekend}} = 12 \times 9 = 108 \) hours.
Thus, the total working hours are:
\( 108 + 105 = 213 \)

Putting this into the format requested:

<reasoning>
We calculated that Jeff spends 108 hours working on the weekend (since he spends 3 hours each day catching up and 4 times as many on weekdays as the weekend) and 105 hours working on weekdays. Adding these up, we find a total of 213 hours.

Let's first calculate the number of hours Jeff spends catching up with his Facebook pals over the weekend. Since he spends 3 hours each day catching up and there are 2 days in the weekend, he spends:

3 hours/day * 2 days = 6 hours in total over the weekend.

According to the problem, he spends three times as many hours catching up on the weekend as he does working on the weekend. So, if he spends 6 hours catching up, we can find out the number of hours he spends working by dividing the number of hours catching up by 3:

6 hours catching up / 3 = 2 hours working.

Now we know he spends 2 hours working on the weekend. Since he works the same amount of time Monday through Friday, he spends:

2 hours per day * 5 days = 10 hours in total over the weekdays.

Adding the weekend hours (6 hours) to the weekday hours (10 hours) gives us:

6 hours weekend + 10 hours weekdays = 16 hours in total for the entire week.

To determine the total number of hours Jeff spends working in a week, we need to break down his schedules for the weekend and the weekdays.

1. **Weekend Schedule:**
   - **Catching up with Facebook pals:** Jeff spends 3 hours on Facebook on each day. Since he does this three times a weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he spends:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Weekday Schedule:**
   - **Catching up with Facebook pals:** Jeff spends 3 hours on Facebook every weekday. Since there are 5 weekdays, he spends:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]
     These 15 hours are four times the amount of time he spends working.

   - **Working:** If 15 hours of Facebook time is four times the amount of time spent working, then the amount of time he spends working is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{4} = 3.75 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

3. **Total Working Hours per Week:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours Jeff spends working in a week is:
     \[
     3.75 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 18.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

**Answer: 18.75 hours**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Weekend Hours**:
   - Jeff spends 3 hours every day catching up with his Facebook pals.
   - He works three times as many hours on the weekend.
   - Therefore, the hours he works on the weekend is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours per day.
   - Since there are 2 days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), the total weekend work hours are \(9 \times 2 = 18\) hours.

2. **Monday Through Friday Hours**:
   - Jeff spends 9 hours every day working from Monday to Friday.
   - So, the total work hours over Monday to Friday is \(9 \times 5 = 45\) hours.

3. **Total Weekly Work Hours**:
   - Add the weekend work hours to the Monday to Friday work hours to get the total weekly hours.
   - Total weekly work hours = Weekend work hours + Monday to Friday work hours
   - Total weekly work hours = 18 + 45 = 63 hours.

4. **Monday Through Friday Hours**:
   - Jeff spends 9 hours every day catching up.
   - Since there are 5 days from Monday to Friday, the total catching up hours over these days are \(9 \times 5 = 45\) hours.

5. **Total Hours in a Week**:
   - Add the total working hours to the total catching up hours.
   - Total weekly hours = Total weekend work hours + Total weekday working hours + Total weekday catching up hours
   - Total weekly hours = 18 (weekend) + 45 (weekdays working) + 45 (weekdays catching up)
   - Total weekly hours = 18 + 45 + 45 = 108 hours.

**Answer**: Jeff spends a total of 108 hours working and catching up with his Facebook pals in an entire week.

Let's denote the number of hours Jeff spends catching up with his Facebook pals on the weekend as \( W \) and the number of hours he spends working Monday through Friday as \( D \).

According to the information given:
- He spends 3 hours every day catching up, so \( W = 3 \times 7 = 21 \) hours on the weekend.
- He spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up with his Facebook pals as he does working, so \( W = 3D \).
- Monday through Friday, he spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up, so \( D = 4W \).

We can use the first equation to find \( W \):
\( W = 3D \)
Since \( W = 21 \), we have:
\( 21 = 3D \)
Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
\( D = 7 \) hours per day on Monday through Friday.

Now, since he works 7 days a week, the total number of hours he spends working in an entire week is:
\( 7D = 7 \times 7 = 49 \) hours.

So, Jeff spends 49 hours working in an entire week.

To determine how many hours Jeff spends working in a week, we first need to establish the number of hours he spends working each day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. **Weekend Hours:**
   - Jeff catches up with his Facebook pals on the weekend.
   - He spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up as he does working.
   - He spends 3 hours every day catching up.
   
   Therefore, the number of hours he spends working on the weekend is:
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ hours/day}}{3} = 1 \text{ hour/day}
   \]

2. **Work Hours per Day:**
   - Jeff spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up on Monday to Friday.
   - He spends 3 hours every day working.

   Therefore, the number of hours he spends working on Monday to Friday is:
   \[
   4 \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 12 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. **Total Weekwork Hours:**
   - There are 5 working days in a week (Monday through Friday).
   - The total hours he spends working in a week is:
   \[
   5 \text{ days} \times 12 \text{ hours/day} = 60 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total Weekend Work Hours:**
   - We know that the total hours he spends working on the weekend is 12 hours.

5. **Total Work Hours in a Week:**
   - The total number of work hours in a week is the sum of his work hours on the weekdays and the weekend:
   \[
   60 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 72 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, Jeff spends a total of 72 hours working in an entire week.

Let's break it down step by step.

Jeff spends 3 hours every day catching up with his Facebook pals. Over three days (the weekend), he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, on the weekend, Jeff spends 9 hours catching up. That means he spends the remaining time at work during the weekend:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/day} - 9 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]
in order to work throughout the rest of the weekend.

From Monday to Friday, Jeff works four times as many hours as he catches up on Facebook. He catches up 3 hours each day and works:
\[ 4 \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 12 \text{ hours/day} \]

Over the five weekdays, he spends:
\[ 12 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Jeff spends working in an entire week is:
\[ 60 \text{ hours} + 15 \text{ hours} = 75 \text{ hours} \]

   - Jeff spends 3 hours each day on Facebook.
   - There are 2 days in the weekend.
   - Hours spent on Facebook on the weekend: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours.

2. **Monday through Friday:**
   - Jeff spends 4 times as many hours working as he does catching up.
   - Hours spent working on a single day: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) hours.

3. **Total working hours for Monday through Friday:**
   - There are 5 days from Monday to Friday.
   - Hours spent working on Monday through Friday: \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) hours.

4. **Total working hours for the entire week:**
   - Hours spent working on the weekend: 6 hours.
   - Total working hours: \( 6 + 60 = 66 \) hours.

**Reasoning:**

- We calculate the hours spent working on the weekend as \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) hours per day for 2 days.
- For Monday through Friday, we use the formula hours worked = 4 times hours spent catching up, resulting in 60 hours.
- Finally, we add the weekend hours to Monday through Friday hours to get the total work hours.

Let's denote the number of hours Jeff spends catching up with his Facebook pals each day as \( C \) and the number of hours he spends working each day as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jeff spends 3 hours every day catching up.
2. He spends 3 hours every day catching up, so \( C = 3 \).
3. He spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up as he does working. Since he catches up 3 hours each day, this means he works 33 hours per weekend day (3 hours on each day over 10 days).
4. He spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up every weekday. Since he catches up 3 hours each day, this means he works 12 hours per weekday day (4 hours on each day over 5 days).

Now we calculate the number of hours he spends working in a week:
- Working hours on weekdays: \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \)
- Working hours on weekends: \( 10 \times 33 = 330 \)

Total working hours = \( 60 + 330 = 390 \).

Let's denote the number of hours Jeff spends catching up with Facebook pals on the weekend as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \) hours, because he spends 3 hours every day catching up. Let's denote the number of hours he spends working every day as \( y \).

On the weekend, Jeff spends three times as many hours catching up as he does working. So, if he works \( y \) hours on the weekend, he spends \( 3y \) hours catching up. Since he catches up on the weekend every day, the total number of hours he spends catching up on the weekend is \( 2x = 6 \) hours (since there are 2 days in a weekend). The equation for the weekend is:
\[ 3y + 3y = 6 \]
\[ 6y = 6 \]
\[ y = 1 \]

So, Jeff spends 1 hour working every day on the weekend.

From Monday to Friday, Jeff works four times as many hours working as he does catching up. So, if he catches up 3 hours every day, he works \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) hours every day. Since there are 5 weekdays, the total number of hours he spends working on weekdays is:
\[ 12 \times 5 = 60 \]

Adding the hours he spends working on the weekend (which is 1 hour per day for 2 days):

To determine how many hours Jeff spends working in an entire week, we need to break down his schedule day by day.

First, let's identify the number of hours Jeff spends catching up on Facebook each day. According to the problem, he spends 3 hours each day catching up with his Facebook pals.

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Jeff spends working each day. The problem states that he spends three times as many hours working as he does catching up. Therefore, the number of hours he spends working each day is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours of catching up} \times 3 = 9 \text{ hours of working} \]
Since this is the same for every day from Monday to Friday, the total hours he spends working from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to account for the hours he spends working on the weekend. The problem states that he spends four times as many hours working on the weekend as he does catching up. Since he spends 3 hours each day catching up, the number of hours he spends working each day on the weekend is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours of catching up} \times 4 = 12 \text{ hours of working} \]
Since he works on the weekend for two days (Saturday and Sunday), the total hours he spends working on the weekend is:
\[ 12 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add the hours he spends working from Monday to Friday and the hours he spends working on the weekend to get the total number of hours he spends working in the entire week:
\[ 45 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ hours} = 69 \text{ hours} \]
