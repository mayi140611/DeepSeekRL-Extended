system
<reasoning>
To determine how many rocking chairs Ben can build in 10 days, we first need to calculate the total number of hours he works in those 10 days. Since he works 8-hour shifts each day, the total number of hours in 10 days is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/shift} \times 10 \text{ days} = 80 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time it takes him to build one rocking chair. According to the problem, it takes him 5 hours to build one rocking chair. Therefore, the number of chairs he can build in 80 hours is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ hours/chair}} = 16 \text{ chairs} \]

So, Ben can build 16 rocking chairs in 10 days.

To calculate how many chairs Ben can build in 10 days, we first need to determine how many chairs he can build in one day by dividing the total hours in a day (8) by the number of hours it takes him to build one chair (5).

\( \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \) chairs per day.

Next, to find out how many chairs he can build in 10 days, we multiply the number of chairs he builds in one day by 10.

\( 1.6 \times 10 = 16 \) chairs.

So Ben can build 16 chairs in 10 days.

To determine how many rocking chairs Ben can build in 10 days, we can break this down into a few steps:

1. Calculate how many hours Ben works in one day: \(8 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 80 \text{ hours}\).
2. Determine how many hours Ben has available to build chairs each day: \(80 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours/chair} = 75 \text{ hours/day}\).
3. Calculate the number of rocking chairs he can build in one day: \(75 \text{ hours/day} \div 5 \text{ hours/chair} = 15 \text{ chairs/day}\).
4. Finally, calculate the total number of chairs he can build in 10 days: \(15 \text{ chairs/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ chairs}\).

Therefore, Ben can build 150 rocking chairs in 10 days.

To determine how many rocking chairs Ben can build in 10 days, let's break down the information given:

1. Ben works 8-hour shifts in the furniture shop.
2. It takes him 5 hours to build 1 rocking chair.
3. There are 10 days for the calculation.

First, we calculate the total number of hours Ben works in 10 days:
\[ \text{Total hours worked in 10 days} = 8 \, \text{hours/shift} \times 10 \, \text{days} = 80 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate how many rocking chairs Ben can build with these 80 hours. Since each chair takes 5 hours to build, we divide the total hours by the hours required to build one chair:
\[ \text{Number of chairs} = \frac{80 \, \text{hours}}{5 \, \text{hours/chair}} = 16 \, \text{chairs} \]

Therefore, Ben can build 16 rocking chairs in 10 days.

Ben works 8-hour shifts and it takes him 5 hours to build 1 rocking chair. Therefore, in one shift, he can build \( \frac{5 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \times 1 \) rocking chair. To calculate the total number of chairs he can build in 10 days, we first need to determine the total number of hours he works in 10 days. Since he works 8 hours a day, in 10 days he works \( 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 80 \text{ hours} \). Then we divide the total hours by the number of hours it takes to build one chair to find out how many chairs he can build. Finally, we multiply the number of chairs by the number of days to get the total number of chairs built.

\[ \text{Hours worked in 10 days} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ hours} \]

Now we find the number of rocking chairs he can build in that time and multiply by the number of days:

\[ \text{Chairs built} = \frac{80 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ hours/chair}} = 16 \text{ chairs} \]

\[ \text{Total chairs} = 16 \text{ chairs} \times 10 \text{ days} = 160 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, Ben can build 160 rocking chairs in 10 days.

Ben works 8-hour shifts. In a day, he works \( \frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \) shifts. In 10 days, he works \( 1.25 \times 10 = 12.5 \) shifts. Since it takes him 5 hours to build one rocking chair, he can build \( \frac{12.5}{5} = 2.5 \) chairs in 10 days. Since he can't build half a chair, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Ben can build 2 chairs in 10 days.

Ben works 8-hour shifts and it takes him 5 hours to build one chair. Therefore, he can work 8/5 hour per chair. In 10 days, he works 10*8 = 80 hours. To determine the number of chairs he can build in 80 hours, divide the total working hours by the hours needed to build one chair. Number of chairs build = 80 / (8/5) = 50. Thus, he can build a total of 50 rocking chairs in 10 days.

Ben works a 8-hour shift, and it takes him 5 hours to build one rocking chair. So, in one shift, he can build \( \frac{8}{5} \) chairs. In 10 days, he works 10 shifts.

First, calculate the number of chairs he can build in one shift: \( \frac{8}{5} \) chairs/hour.

Then, multiply by the number of weeks (10) to find the total number of chairs he can build in 10 days: \( \frac{8}{5} \times 10 \) chairs.

Finally, perform the calculation.

Ben works 8-hour shifts and it takes him 5 hours to build a rocking chair. Therefore, he can build $8\, \text{hours per shift} / 5\, \text{hours per chair} = 1.6$ chairs per shift. 

In one day, he can therefore build $1.6 \times 8\, \text{hours per day} = 12.8$ chairs.

To determine how many rocking chairs Ben can build in 10 days, we first need to calculate how many chairs he can build in one day and then multiply that by 10.

1. **Calculate the number of chairs Ben can build in one shift**:
   Ben works 8 hours per shift and it takes him 5 hours to build one rocking chair.
   \[
   \text{Number of chairs per shift} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ hours per chair}} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \text{ chairs per shift}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of chairs Ben can build in one day**:
   Since Ben works 8-hour shifts per day:
   \[
   \text{Number of chairs per day} = 1.6 \text{ chairs per shift} \times 8 \text{ hours per shift} = 1.6 \times 8 = 12.8 \text{ chairs per day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of chairs Ben can build in 10 days**:
   Ben works for 10 days:
   \[
   \text{Number of chairs in 10 days} = 12.8 \text{ chairs per day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 128 \text{ chairs}
   \]

So, Ben can build 128 rocking chairs in 10 days.
