John buys 10 packs of magic cards, each with 20 cards.
So, there are a total of \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cards.

1/4 of these cards are uncommon, hence the number of uncommon cards is:
\(\frac{200}{4} = 50\).

Therefore, the answer is 50.

John buys 10 packs of magic cards, and each pack has 20 cards. To find the total number of uncommon cards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cards John has:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ cards per pack} = 200 \text{ cards} \]

2. Determine how many of these cards are uncommon. Since 1/4 of the cards are uncommon:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 200 \text{ cards} = 50 \text{ uncommon cards} \]

Therefore, John got 50 uncommon cards.

#### GENERATION 14 RESPONSE ####


system
First, we find the total number of cards John bought by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cards in each pack:
\[10 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ cards per pack} = 200 \text{ cards}\]

Next, we calculate the number of uncommon cards by multiplying the total number of cards by the fraction that are uncommon:
\[200 \text{ cards} \times \frac{1}{4} = 50 \text{ uncommon cards}\]

Therefore, John got 50 uncommon cards.

#### GENERATION 16 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out how many uncommon cards John got, we need to multiply the total number of cards by the fraction that is uncommon.

1 pack = 20 cards
1/4 of these are uncommon, so we calculate:
\(20 \text{ cards/pack} \times \frac{1}{4} = 5 \text{ cards/uncommon}\)

Since John bought 10 packs, we multiply the uncommon cards per pack by the number of packs:

\(5 \text{ cards/uncommon} \times 10 \text{ packs} = 50 \text{ uncommon cards}\)

Therefore, John got 50 uncommon cards.
