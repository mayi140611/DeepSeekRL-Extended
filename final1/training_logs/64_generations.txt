###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

#### ANS ####

840
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
James earns $20/hour at his main job, so in 30 hours, he earns $20/hour * 30 hours = $600.

For his second job, he earns 20% less than $20/hour, which is $20/hour * 0.80 = $16/hour.

He works half as much at his second job as at his main job, so he works 30 hours / 2 = 15 hours at his second job.

So at his second job, he earns $16/hour * 15 hours = $240.

Therefore, in a week, James earns $600 + $240 = $840.

Therefore, the answer is 840.

First, let's calculate James's earnings from his secondary job. He earns 20% less than the $20 per hour at his main job. To calculate the hourly rate at his secondary job, we take 20% of $20, which is 0.2 * $20. Subtract this value from $20 to get his hourly rate at his secondary job. Then we multiply this rate by the 15 hours he works to determine his earnings there.

Next, we calculate his earnings from his main job by finding the product of his hourly rate at his main job, 20, and the number of hours he works, 30.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from both jobs to find his total weekly earnings.

Let's work through these calculations step-by-step.

Now let's perform the calculations.

<answer>
To calculate the earnings:

1. Calculate the hourly rate at the secondary job:
   0.2 * $20 = $4
   Hourly rate at the secondary job: $20 - $4 = $16

2. Calculate the earnings from the secondary job:
   16 * 15 = $240

3. Calculate the earnings from the main job:
   20 * 30 = $600

Therefore, the weekly earnings would be:
240 + 600 = $840

He earns $20*.2=$4 less which is $16 less per week.
So he earns $20-$16=$4 less
He works 30*2=60 hours at his main job
So he earns $4*60=$240
He works 30/2=15 hours at his second job
So he earns $4*15=$60
He earns $240+$60=$300 per week

First we multiply James' hourly rate at his main job by the number of hours he works at his main job to find how much he earns at his main job: 20 * 30 = $600. Then we divide that amount by 50% = 0.5 to find how much he earns at his second job: 600 / 0.5 = $1200. Then we add the two amounts together to find his total pay: $1200 + $600 = $1800. 

Therefore, the answer is 1800.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. James earns $20 an hour at his main job.
   - He works 30 hours at his main job.
   
2. James earns 20% less at his second job.
   
3. To find out how much he earns per hour at his second job, we calculate 80% of $20 (since he earns 20% less, that's 100% - 20% = 80% of his main job's hourly wage):
   - $20 x 80% = $20 x 0.80 = $16 per hour at his second job.

4. He works half the hours at his second job compared to his main job.
   - Half of 30 hours = 30 / 2 = 15 hours.

5. To calculate his weekly earnings:
   - From his main job: $20/hour x 30 hours = $600.
   - From his second job: $16/hour x 15 hours = $240.
   
6. Total weekly earnings:
   - Main job earnings + Second job earnings = $600 + $240 = $840.

Therefore, James earns $840 per week.

To determine how much James earns per week, we need to calculate his earnings from both his main job and his second job.

First, let's calculate his earnings from his main job:
- James earns $20 per hour.
- He works 30 hours at his main job.

\[
\text{Earnings from main job} = 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 30 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate his earnings from his second job:
- James earns 20% less per hour at his second job.
- This means he earns 80% of the hourly rate he earns at his main job.

\[
\text{Hourly rate at second job} = 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.80 = 16 \text{ dollars/hour}
\]

- He works half of the hours he works at his main job at his second job.

\[
\text{Hours worked at second job} = \frac{30 \text{ hours}}{2} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
\text{Earnings from second job} = 16 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 15 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the earnings from both jobs to find his total weekly earnings:

\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Earnings from main job} + \text{Earnings from second job} = 600 \text{ dollars} + 240 \text{ dollars} = 840 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, James earns \boxed{840} dollars per week.

At his second job, James earns $20 - 0.20($20) = $16 an hour.
At his second job, he works 30/2 = 15 hours.
At his main job, he earns $20/ hour x 30 hours = $600.
At his second job, he earns $16 / hour x 15 hours = $240.
In one week, he earns a total of $600 + $240 = $840.

First, we need to find out how much James earns per hour from his second job. Since he earns 20% less than his main job, we can calculate this as follows:

\( 20\% \) of $20 = \( 0.20 \times 20 = $4 \)

So, he earns $20 - $4 = $16 an hour from his second job.

Next, we calculate how many hours he works at his second job:

\( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) hours

Now we can find out how much he earns from both jobs:

For his main job: \( 30 \times 20 = $600 \)
For his second job: \( 15 \times 16 = $240 \)

Finally, we add the earnings from both jobs to find his total weekly earnings:

Total weekly earnings = $600 + $240 = $840

So, James earns $840 per week.

To find out how much James earns per week, we need to calculate his earnings from both his main job and second job separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate his earnings from his main job:
Earnings from main job = Hourly wage × Number of hours worked
Earnings from main job = $20/hour × 30 hours
Earnings from main job = $600

Next, let's calculate his earnings from his second job:
James works half as many hours at his second job as he does at his main job:
Number of hours worked at second job = 30 hours / 2
Number of hours worked at second job = 15 hours

Earnings from second job = Hourly wage × Number of hours worked
Earnings from second job = $20/hour × 15 hours
Earnings from second job = $300

Now, let's add his earnings from both jobs to find his total weekly earnings:
Total weekly earnings = Earnings from main job + Earnings from second job
Total weekly earnings = $600 + $300
Total weekly earnings = $900

Therefore, James earns $900 per week.

First, let's calculate James's earnings from his main job. He earns $20 per hour and works 30 hours a week. So, his earnings from the main job are:
$20/hour * 30 hours/week = $600/week

Next, let's calculate his earnings from his second job. He earns 20% less than his main job, which is $20 per hour. Therefore, he earns:
$20 * (1 - 0.20) = $20 * 0.80 = $16/hour

He works half as many hours as his main job, so he works:
30 hours/week / 2 = 15 hours/week

Now, let's calculate his earnings from his second job. At $16 per hour and 15 hours a week, his earnings from the second job are:
$16/hour * 15 hours/week = $240/week

Finally, to find out his total weekly earnings, we add his earnings from both jobs:
$600/week (main job) + $240/week (second job) = $840/week

Therefore, James earns $840 per week.

First, let's find out how much James earns at his second job. Since he earns 20% less, he earns 100% - 20% = 80% of the salary at his second job. 

Now, let's calculate how many hours he works at his second job. If he works half the hours at his second job as he does at his main job, he works 30 hours / 2 = 15 hours at his second job.

At his main job, he earns $20 per hour and works 30 hours, so he earns $20 * 30 = $600.

At his second job, he earns 80% of his main job's salary, which is $20 per hour * 80% = $16 per hour.

He works 15 hours at his second job, so he earns $16 * 15 = $240.

Now, let's add up his earnings from both jobs to find out how much he earns per week: 
$600 (main job) + $240 (second job) = $840.

So, James earns $840 per week.

To calculate James's weekly earnings, we first need to determine his hourly wage at his second job and then calculate his earnings for each job.

1. **Hourly Wage at the Second Job**: 
   James earns 20% less at his second job. 20% of $20 is calculated as follows:
   \[
   0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   Subtracting this from his main job wage:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16
   \]
   So, James earns $16 per hour at his second job.

2. **Hours Worked at Each Job**:
   - At his main job, he works 30 hours.
   - At his second job, he works half the number of hours at his main job:
     \[
     \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Weekly Earnings Calculation**:
   - Main job earnings: $20/hour * 30 hours = $600
   - Second job earnings: $16/hour * 15 hours = $240

4. **Total Weekly Earnings**:
   \[
   600 + 240 = 840 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Answer**:
James earns $840 per week.

James earns $20 \cdot 0.2 = $4 less at his second job.
Thus he earns $20 - $4 = $16 per hour while working at his second job.

He earns $16/hour \cdot 0.5 = $8 per hour at his second job.

James earns $20/hour \cdot 30 = $600 per week at his main job.

He earns $8/hour \cdot 8 = $64 per week at his second job.

Thus, he earns a total of $600 + $64 = $664 per week.

Therefore, the answer is 664.
