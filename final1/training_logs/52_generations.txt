#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let $x$ be the number of pencils in each box.
Arnel shared $10 + 5x$ pencils with his friends.

There are $5x$ pencils in total given to his friends.

We know that $10 + 5x = 5 \cdot 8 = 40$,

Solving the equation gives $x = \boxed{6}$.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{6}$ pencils in each box.

The answer is the number of pencils in each box

Arnel kept ten pencils for himself. Since each of his five friends got eight pencils, his friends received a total of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pencils. Subtracting the ten pencils Arnel kept, he shared \(40 - 10 = 30\) pencils with his friends. This means Arnel had \(30 + 10 = 40\) pencils in total.

Since he had ten boxes of pencils with the same number of pencils in each box, the number of pencils in each box is \(40 \div 10 = 4\). 

Therefore, the answer is 4.

system
Arnel shared the ten pencils with his five friends, so he had \(10 - 10 = 0\) pencils left to share among his friends. This means each friend got \(8\) pencils and Arnel had \(0\) pencils left. If we let the total number of pencils in Arnel's ten boxes be \(10x\), then we know that \(10x = 8 \times 5 + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50\). This implies that \(x = \boxed{5}\).

Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnel has 10 boxes of pencils, with the same number of pencils in each box.
2. He kept 10 pencils for himself.
3. He shared the remaining pencils equally with his 5 friends.
4. His friends each received 8 pencils.

First, let's determine the total number of pencils the friends received:

\[ 5 \text{ friends} \times 8 \text{ pencils per friend} = 40 \text{ pencils} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pencils Arnel had initially:

\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Pencils kept} + \text{Pencils shared} \]
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 10 \text{ (friends' pencils)} + 40 \text{ (Arnel's) = 50 \text{ pencils}} \]

Arnel had 10 boxes of pencils, so we can find out how many pencils are in each box by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of boxes:

\[ \text{Pencils per box} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{\text{Number of boxes}} \]
\[ \text{Pencils per box} = \frac{50}{10} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils in each box is 5.

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Since Arnel had ten boxes, the total number of pencils he had initially was \( 10x \).

Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself, so the number of pencils he shared with his friends was \( 10x - 10 \).

He shared these pencils equally among his five friends, with each friend receiving 8 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils shared is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \).

We can now set up the equation:
\[ 10x - 10 = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 10x = 40 + 10 \]
\[ 10x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{10} \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of pencils in each box is \( \boxed{5} \).

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of pencils in each box.

1. **Total number of pencils Arnel has**:
   - Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself.
   - He shared the remaining pencils equally among his 5 friends.
   - Each of his 5 friends received 8 pencils.
   
   Therefore, the total number of pencils shared with his friends is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ pencils}
   \]

2. **Total number of pencils**:
   - Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself.
   - He shared 40 pencils with his friends.

   Therefore, the total number of pencils Arnel had initially is:
   \[
   10 + 40 = 50 \text{ pencils}
   \]

3. **Number of boxes**:
   - Arnel had 10 boxes of pencils.
   - Each box contains the same number of pencils.

   Let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box.

4. **Total number of pencils in all boxes**:
   - Since Arnel has 10 boxes of pencils and the total number of pencils is 50, we can write:
   \[
   10x = 50
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{50}{10} = 5
   \]

Therefore, each box contains \( \boxed{5} \) pencils.

system
To solve this problem, let's first determine how many pencils Arnel shared with his friends. Since each of his five friends received eight pencils, the total number of pencils given to his friends is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pencils.

Next, we subtract the number of pencils given to his friends from the total number of pencils to find out how many pencils were in each box. We know Arnel kept ten pencils for himself, so the total number of pencils in the ten boxes is \(40 + 10 = 50\).

Now, since Arnel had ten boxes and the total number of pencils in these boxes is 50, we can divide 50 by 10 to find out how many pencils are in each box. This calculation gives us \(50 / 10 = 5\) pencils per box.

Therefore, the reason for the solution is that we calculated the total number of pencils in both Arnel's box and his friends' together, then subtracted the number of pencils Arnel kept to find the number in the boxes, and then divided that number by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils in each box.

Here's the answer:

Each box contains 5 pencils.

system
Let's denote the total number of pencils Arnel had as \( T \). According to the problem, Arnel shared ten pencils with himself, so the number of pencils he kept is \( T - 10 \). This remaining number of pencils is then shared equally among his five friends, with each friend getting eight pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils shared with friends is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) pencils. This means the total number of pencils Arnel had can be calculated as follows:

\[
T - 10 = 40 \implies T = 40 + 10 \implies T = 50
\]

So, the total number of pencils Arnel had is 50. Since this number of pencils is in ten boxes, the number of pencils in each box is:

\[
\frac{50}{10} = 5
\]

Therefore, the number of pencils in each box is \( \boxed{5} \).

Let's denote the total number of pencils Arnel had as \( T \). He had ten boxes of pencils, so the total number of pencils is \( 10 \times \text{(number of pencils in each box)} \). Therefore, \( T = 10 \times \text{(number of pencils in each box)} \).

Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself. So, the number of remaining pencils among his five friends is \( T - 10 \). Since his friends were each given 8 pencils, we can write:

\[ T - 10 = 5 \times 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the value of \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 10 \times \text{(number of pencils in each box)} - 10 = 40 \]

Let's solve for the number of pencils in each box:

\[ 10 \times \text{(number of pencils in each box)} = 40 + 10 \]
\[ 10 \times \text{(number of pencils in each box)} = 50 \]
\[ \text{(number of pencils in each box)} = \frac{50}{10} \]
\[ \text{(number of pencils in each box)} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils in each box is 5.

Let's denote the total number of pencils Arnel had as \( T \). Since he shared his pencils equally with his five friends and each friend received 8 pencils, the total number of pencils he shared can be expressed as \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Arnel had initially is \( T = 40 \).

Since Arnel had ten boxes of pencils, the total number of pencils is also equal to \( 10 \times n \), where \( n \) is the number of pencils in each box. Thus, we can write the equation:
\[ 10n = 40 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 10:
\[ n = \frac{40}{10} = 4 \]

So, the number of pencils in each box is \( 4 \).

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Since Arnel had ten boxes of pencils, the total number of pencils he had is \( 10x \).

Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself. Therefore, the number of pencils he shared with his five friends is \( 10x - 10 \).

According to the problem, each of his five friends received 8 pencils. So, the total number of pencils shared with his friends is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \).

Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[
10x - 10 = 40

Let's solve this step by step:

1) Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself. Each of his 5 friends received 8 pencils, so in total, he shared:
   5 friends * 8 pencils each = 40 pencils

2) The total number of pencils Arnel had is the sum of the pencils he kept and the pencils he shared, which is:
   10 pencils (kept) + 40 pencils (shared) = 50 pencils

3) Arnel had ten boxes of pencils, so each box must contain:
   50 pencils / 10 boxes = 5 pencils per box

Therefore, each box contains 5 pencils.

This reasoning leads us to the answer that each of the ten boxes contains 5 pencils.
