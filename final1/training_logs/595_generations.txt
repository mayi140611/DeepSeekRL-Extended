Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bianca worked for 12.5 hours.
2. Celeste worked for twice that amount, so 12.5 * 2 = 25 hours.
3. McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste. So, 25 - 8.5 = 16.5 hours.

Now, let's convert these hours into minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes

1. Bianca's work in minutes: 12.5 * 60 = 750 minutes
2. Celeste's work in minutes: 25 * 60 = 1500 minutes
3. McClain's work in minutes: 16.5 * 60 = 990 minutes

Now, let's sum these up to get the total minutes worked by all three:

Total minutes = 750 + 1500 + 990 = 3240 minutes

So, the 3 people worked a total of 3240 minutes.

To find out how many minutes the three people worked in total, we need to first determine how many hours each person worked and then convert those hours to minutes.

1. Bianca worked for 12.5 hours.

2. Celeste worked twice as long as Bianca:
   Celeste's work hours = 2 * Bianca's work hours = 2 * 12.5 = 25 hours

3. McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste:
   McClain's work hours = Celeste's work hours - 8.5 = 25 - 8.5 = 16.5 hours

Now, we convert the total hours worked by all three individuals to minutes:
- Bianca: 12.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 750 minutes
- Celeste: 25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1500 minutes
- McClain: 16.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 990 minutes

Total minutes worked by all three people:
750 + 1500 + 990 = 3240 minutes

To determine the total number of minutes the three people worked, we'll start by calculating the hours worked by each individual, then convert those hours to minutes, and finally sum them up.

1. **Calculate Celeste's hours worked:**
   Celeste worked for twice the amount of time that Bianca did.
   \[
   \text{Celeste's hours} = 2 \times 12.5 = 25 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate McClain's hours worked:**
   McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste.
   \[
   \text{McClain's hours} = 25 - 8.5 = 16.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total hours worked by all three:**
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 12.5 \text{ hours} + 25 \text{ hours} + 16.5 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Convert the total hours to minutes:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   \[
   \text{Total minutes} = 54 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3240 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the total minutes worked by Bianca, Celeste, and McClain is **3240 minutes**.

To find out how many minutes the three people worked in total, we first need to determine the number of hours each person worked and then convert those hours into minutes.

Bianca worked for 12.5 hours.
Celeste worked for twice that amount, so Celeste worked for \(2 \times 12.5 = 25\) hours.
McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste, so McClain worked for \(25 - 8.5 = 16.5\) hours.

Next, we'll convert the hours worked by each person into minutes:
- Bianca worked \(12.5 \times 60 = 750\) minutes.
- Celeste worked \(25 \times 60 = 1500\) minutes.
- McClain worked \(16.5 \times 60 = 990\) minutes.

To find the total minutes worked by the three people, we add their individual work in minutes:
\[750 + 1500 + 990 = 3240 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total number of minutes worked by the three people is 3240 minutes.

Bianca worked for 12.5 hours. Celeste worked for twice that amount, which is \(2 \times 12.5\) hours.

McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste, so we need to subtract 8.5 hours from Celeste's working hours to find out how many hours McClain worked.

Let's calculate the total hours worked by all three and then convert it into minutes.

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply the total hours by 60.

\[12.5 \text{ hours} + (2 \times 12.5 \text{ hours}) + (2 \times 12.5 \text{ hours} - 8.5 \text{ hours})\]

We will calculate the total hours first, then convert to minutes.

To find the total hours worked by Bianca, Celeste, and McClain, we first calculate the time each person worked:

Bianca worked for 12.5 hours.

Celeste worked for twice that amount of time, which is:
\[ 2 \times 12.5 \text{ hours} = 25 \text{ hours} \]

McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste, so we subtract 8.5 hours from Celeste's time:
\[ 25 \text{ hours (Celeste)} - 8.5 \text{ hours} = 16.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up the total hours worked by all three:

\[ 12.5 \text{ hours} + 25 \text{ hours} + 16.5 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):

\[ 54 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3240 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total number of minutes worked by the three people is 3240 minutes.

To find the total minutes worked by Bianca, Celeste, and McClain, we'll start by calculating their individual hours worked:

1. Bianca's working hours: 12.5
2. Celeste's working hours: 2 * Bianca's hours = 2 * 12.5 = 25
3. McClain's working hours: Celeste's hours - 8.5 = 25 - 8.5 = 16.5

Next, we will add these hours to find the total hours worked in minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert hours to minutes:

1. Bianca's total minutes: 12.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour
2. Celeste's total minutes: 25 hours * 60 minutes/hour

First, let's calculate the number of hours each person worked:

Bianca worked for 12.5 hours.
Celeste worked for twice that amount, which is \( 12.5 \times 2 = 25 \) hours.
McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste, which is \( 25 - 8.5 = 16.5 \) hours.

Next, let's convert their hours into minutes for ease of addition. There are 60 minutes in an hour:

- Bianca: \( 12.5 \times 60 = 750 \) minutes.
- Celeste: \( 25 \times 60 = 1500 \) minutes.
- McClain: \( 16.5 \times 60 = 990 \) minutes.

Finally, let's add up the total minutes worked by all three:

Total minutes = Bianca's minutes + Celeste's minutes + McClain's minutes
             = \( 750 + 1500 + 990 \)

To find out the total number of minutes worked by Bianca, Celeste, and McClain, we first need to determine the number of hours each person worked and then convert those hours to minutes, sum them up, and convert the total back to hours. 

1. **Bianca's work**: 12.5 hours
   - Converted to minutes: \( 12.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 750 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Celeste's work**: Since Celeste worked for twice the amount of time as Bianca, she worked:
   - \( 12.5 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 25 \text{ hours} \)
   - Converted to minutes: \( 25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1500 \text{ minutes} \)

3. **McClain's work**: McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste. Therefore, she worked:
   - \( 25 \text{ hours} - 8.5 \text{ hours} = 16.5 \text{ hours} \)
   - Converted to minutes: \( 16.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 990 \text{ minutes} \)

4. **Total minutes worked**: 
   - Add the minutes worked by Bianca, Celeste, and McClain: \( 750 \text{ minutes} + 1500 \text{ minutes} + 990 \text{ minutes} = 3240 \text{ minutes} \)

5. **Minutes to hours**: 
   - Convert the total minutes to hours: \( 3240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 54 \text{ hours} \)

Therefore, the total number of minutes worked by the three people is **54 hours**.

Bianca's work time is given as 12.5 hours.

Celeste worked for twice that amount, so Celeste's work time is \( 12.5 \times 2 = 25 \) hours.

McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste, so McClain's work time is \( 25 - 8.5 = 16.5 \) hours.

To find out how many minutes all three worked, we need to convert each of their work times to minutes and add them together.
