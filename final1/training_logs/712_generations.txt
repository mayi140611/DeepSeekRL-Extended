First, let's convert the amounts each person has into cents. 

- Lance has 70 cents.
- Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) cents.
- Guy has two quarters (each worth 25 cents) plus a dime (10 cents), which is \( 2 \times 25 + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \) cents.
- Bill has six dimes, which is \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \) cents.

Now, we'll add up all their amounts in cents:

- Lance: 70 cents
- Margaret: 75 cents
- Guy: 60 cents
- Bill: 60 cents

Total amount: \( 70 + 75 + 60 + 60 = 265 \) cents.

To find the total amount of money they have combined, let's first convert each person's amount to cents.

Lance has 70 cents.

Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar. Since one dollar is equal to 100 cents, three-fourths of a dollar is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ cents}
\]

Guy has two quarters and a dime. Two quarters are worth:
\[
2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ cents}
\]
A dime is worth 10 cents, so Guy's amount in cents is:
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
\]

Bill has six dimes. Six dimes are worth:
\[
6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, let's add up the amounts:
\[
70 \text{ cents} + 75 \text{ cents} + 60 \text{ cents} + 60 \text{ cents}
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
70 + 75 = 145
\]
\[
145 + 60 = 205
\]
\[
205 + 60 = 265
\]

So, their combined total is 265 cents.

The total amount of money that Lance, Margaret, Guy, and Bill have combined is 265 cents.

To find out how many cents they have combined, we need to calculate the total amount each person has and then sum it up.

1. Lance has 70 cents.
2. Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar, which is equivalent to 300 cents.
3. Guy has two quarters and a dime. Since a quarter is 25 cents, two quarters are 50 cents, and a dime is 10 cents, Guy has a total of 50 + 10 = 60 cents.
4. Bill has six dimes, which is 60 cents.

Now we add these amounts together: 70 + 300 + 60 + 60 = 590 cents.

Lance has 70 cents.

Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar. Since one dollar is 100 cents, three-fourths of a dollar is:
\[
3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ cents}
\]

Guy has two quarters (each quarter is 25 cents) and a dime (10 cents). So, the total for Guy is:
\[
2 \times 25 + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
\]

Bill has six dimes, each dime is 10 cents. So, the total for Bill is:
\[
6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[
70 + 75 + 60 + 60 = 265 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, they have combined 265 cents.

First, we need to convert all amounts into cents to make the calculations easier. 

- Lance has 70 cents.
- Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar, which is \(3/4 \times 100 = 75\) cents.
- Guy has two quarters and a dime. Since one quarter is 25 cents and a dime is 10 cents, Guy has \(2 \times 25 + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60\) cents.
- Bill has six dimes, which is \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.

Now, we add up all their amounts in cents:
\[ 70 + 75 + 60 + 60 = 265 \]

So, in total, they have 265 cents.

First, we need to convert Margaret's amount into cents. Since three-fourths of a dollar is 75 cents, we have:
\[ \text{Margaret's cents} = 75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cents Lance has:
\[ \text{Lance's cents} = 70 \]

Guy has two quarters and a dime, which amount to:
\[ 1 \times 25 + 1 \times 10 = 35 \text{ cents} \]

Bill has six dimes, which amount to:
\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add up the cents of all four individuals to find the total.

\[ \text{Total cents} = 70 + 75 + 35 + 60 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 70 + 75 = 145 \]
\[ 145 + 35 = 180 \]
\[ 180 + 60 = 240 \]

So, the total number of cents that Lance, Margaret, Guy, and Bill have combined is \( 240 \).

To find out how many cents Lance, Margaret, Guy, and Bill have combined, we need to convert all their amounts into cents and then sum them up.

1. Lance has 70 cents. This is already in cents, so we leave it as is.
2. Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, three-fourths of a dollar is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ cents}
   \]
3. Guy has two quarters and a dime. Here's the breakdown:
   - Two quarters are worth \(2 \times 25 = 50\) cents.
   - A dime is worth 10 cents.
   Adding these together gives:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
   \]
4. Bill has six dimes. Six dimes are worth:
   \[
   6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
   \]

Now, we sum the amounts:
\[
70 + 75 + 60 + 60 = 265 \text{ cents}
\]

So, combined, they have 265 cents.

Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar. Since one dollar is equal to 100 cents, three-fourths of a dollar would be \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) cents. Therefore, Margaret has 75 cents.

Guy has two quarters and a dime. Each quarter is equal to 25 cents, so two quarters total \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) cents. A dime is equal to 10 cents. So, Guy has \( 50 + 10 = 60 \) cents.
