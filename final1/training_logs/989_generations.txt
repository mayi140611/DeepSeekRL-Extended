#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
<reasoning>
Dean ordered two pizzas, each cut into 12 slices, so the total number of pizza slices is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza, which means he ate \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) slices of Hawaiian pizza.
Frank ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza.
So, the total number of Hawaiian pizza slices eaten is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) slices.

Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza, which means he ate \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) slices of cheese pizza.

The total number of slices eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy is \( 9 + 4 = 13 \) slices.

Therefore, the number of slices left over is \( 24 - 13 = 11 \) slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices Dean had initially. Since Dean ordered 2 large pizzas, each cut into 12 slices, the total number of slices is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) slices.

Next, we calculate how many slices Dean ate. Since Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza, he ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) slices.

Then, we calculate how many slices Frank ate. Frank ate 3 slices of the Hawaiian pizza.

Now, let's calculate how many slices Sammy ate. Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza, so he ate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding up all the slices eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy: \(6 + 3 + 4 = 13\) slices.

Finally, to find out how many slices were left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: \(24 - 13 = 11\).

So, there were 11 slices left over.

To find out how many slices were left over, we need to first determine how many slices were originally available and how many were eaten.

1. Each large pizza is cut into 12 slices.
2. Dean ordered 2 large pizzas, so there are a total of 12 + 12 = 24 slices.
3. Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza, which is 24 / 2 = 12 slices.
4. Frank ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza.
5. Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza. Since there are 12 slices in total, a third of that would be 12 / 3 = 4 slices.

Now we can calculate the total number of slices eaten:
Dean: 12
Frank: 3
Sammy: 4

Total eaten = 12 + 3 + 4 = 19 slices.

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the original total:
Total slices - Total eaten = 24 - 19 = 5 slices left over.

The total number of slices left over is 5, after accounting for the slices eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy.

Dean ordered 2 large pizzas, each cut into 12 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of Hawaiian pizza slices left is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Frank ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza. The remaining slices of the Hawaiian pizza are:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza. The entire cheese pizza is:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of cheese slices Sammy ate is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

The number of cheese slices left is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the remaining Hawaiian and cheese slices together, we get:
\[ 3 \text{ (hawaiian)} + 8 \text{ (cheese)} = 11 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the total number of slices left over is 11.

To determine the total number of slices left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices available.
2. Determine how many slices Dean ate.
3. Determine how many slices Frank ate.
4. Determine how many slices Sammy ate.
5. Subtract the number of slices eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left over.

Let's begin with step 1: We know that Dean ordered 2 pizzas that were each cut into 12 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices available is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, for step 2, we calculate how many slices Dean ate. Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza, so:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ slices} \]

For step 3, we know that Frank ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza.

For step 4, we calculate how many slices Sammy ate. Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza, so:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we can find out how many slices were eaten by adding the number of slices eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy:
\[ 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, for step 5, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 24 - 13 = 11 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the total number of slices left over is:
\[ 11 \]

Dean ordered 2 large pizzas, each cut into 12 slices, totaling 24 slices. Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza, which means he ate \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) slices. Frank ate 3 slices of the Hawaiian pizza. Sam kept 2 slices of the cheese pizza. So in total, 6 (Dean) + 3 (Frank) + 2 (Sam) = 11 slices were eaten. The total number of slices that were originally available on both pizzas is 24. Therefore, there are \( 24 - 11 \) slices left.

First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices Dean ordered. Since each pizza was cut into 12 slices and he ordered 2 pizzas:

Total slices = 2 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 24 slices

Now, let's determine how many slices Dean ate. He ate half of the Hawaiian pizza, which means he ate:

Half of Hawaiian pizza = 12 slices / 2 = 6 slices

Next, Frank ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza.

Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza. Since each pizza is cut into 12 slices, the fraction she ate is:

A third of cheese pizza = 12 slices / 3 = 4 slices

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten. We add the slices eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy:

Total slices eaten = Dean's Hawaiian slices + Frank's Hawaiian slices + Sammy's cheese slices
Total slices eaten = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 slices

Now, to find out how many slices were left overall, we subtract the total eaten slices from the total order:

Total slices left = Total slices - Total slices eaten
Total slices left = 24 slices - 13 slices = 11 slices

Therefore, there are 11 slices left.

First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Dean ordered 2 large pizzas, each cut into 12 slices, so the total number of slices is \(2 \times 12 = 24\).

Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza. Since each pizza is 12 slices, Dean ate \(12 \div 2 = 6\) slices of Hawaiian pizza. Frank ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza, so the number of Hawaiian slices left is \(6 - 3 = 3\).

Samuel ate one third of the cheese pizza. Since each pizza is 12 slices, Samuel ate \(12 \div 3 = 4\) slices of cheese pizza. The number of cheese slices left is \(12 - 4 = 8\).

The total number of slices eaten is the sum of the Hawaiian and cheese slices eaten: \(3 + 4 = 7\).

To find the total number of slices left, we subtract the eaten slices from the initial total: \(24 - 7 = 17\).

Therefore, there are 17 slices left.

First, we need to determine the total number of slices available. Dean ordered two large pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 12 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
2 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 24 slices

Next, we need to account for the slices eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy. Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza, so he ate:
1/2 * 12 slices = 6 slices
Frank ate 3 slices of the Hawaiian pizza.
Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza, so he ate:
1/3 * 12 slices = 4 slices

Now we have a total of slices eaten:
Dean: 6 slices
Frank: 3 slices
Sammy: 4 slices

Let's add the slices eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy:
6 + 3 + 4 = 13 slices

Finally, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices available to find out how many slices are left:
24 slices - 13 slices = 11 slices

First, we need to determine the total number of slices from both pizzas.
Each pizza is cut into 12 slices, so 2 pizzas have a total of:
\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Dean started with 24 slices, and since he ate half of the Hawaiian pizza, he ate:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ slices} = 12 \text{ slices of Hawaiian pizza} \]

After Dean ate, there were:
\[ 24 \text{ slices} - 12 \text{ slices} = 12 \text{ slices} \]

Frank ate 3 slices of the Hawaiian pizza:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 3 \text{ slices} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza. Since there are 12 slices to start with, a third of the cheese pizza is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

After Sammy ate 4 slices of the cheese pizza, there were:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 4 \text{ slices} = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Now, to find the total number of slices left:
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 12 \text{ (Dean)} + 3 \text{ (Frank)} + 4 \text{ (Sammy)} = 19 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:
