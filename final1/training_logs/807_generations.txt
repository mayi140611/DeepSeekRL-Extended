###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

300
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
First, Steve sells 50 fish, leaving him with \(200 - 50 = 150\) fish. Then, a third of the remaining fish become spoiled, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 150 = 50 \) fish spoil. Subtracting the spoiled fish from the remaining fish gives \(150 - 50 = 100\) fish left. After that, a new stock of 200 fish arrives, bringing the total to \(100 + 200 = 300\) fish.

Therefore, Steve now has 300 fish in stock.

<reasoning>
1. **Initial Stock**: Steve starts with 200 fish.
2. **Fish Sold**: Steve sells 50 fish.
   \[
   200 - 50 = 150
   \]
   So, he has 150 fish left after selling.
3. **Fish Spoiled**: A third of the remaining fish spoil.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 150 = 50
   \]
   So, 50 fish become spoiled.
4. **Remaining Fish**: Subtract the spoiled fish from the remaining fish.
   \[
   150 - 50 = 100
   \]
   So, he has 100 fish left after some spoiled.
5. **New Stock Arrival**: A new stock of 200 fish arrives.
   \[
   100 + 200 = 300
   \]
   So, he now has 300 fish in stock.

Steve starts with 200 fish. After selling 50 fish, the remaining stock is \( 200 - 50 = 150 \) fish. When the refrigerators stop working, a third of the remaining fish become spoiled. The number of spoiled fish is \( \frac{150}{3} = 50 \). Therefore, the number of fish left after spoilage is \( 150 - 50 = 100 \) fish. When the new stock of 200 fish arrives, the total stock becomes \( 100 + 200 = 300 \) fish.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Steve initially has 200 fish.
2. He sells 50 fish:
   - Remaining fish: 200 - 50 = 150 fish
3. Because the refrigerators stop working, a third of the remaining fish spoil:
   - Spoiled fish: 1/3 * 150 = 50 fish
   - Fish left after spoilage: 150 - 50 = 100 fish
4. A new stock of 200 more fish arrives:
   - Total fish now: 100 + 200 = 300 fish

Therefore, Steve now has 300 fish in stock.
