To determine how much money Whitney will have left after her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she plans to buy.

Whitney buys:
- 2 posters at $5 each
- 3 notebooks at $4 each
- 2 bookmarks at $2 each

The cost for the posters is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
The cost for the notebooks is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.
The cost for the bookmarks is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.

The total cost for all the items is \(10 + 12 + 4 = 26\) dollars.

Whitney initially has two $20 bills, which totals to \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

Subtract the total cost from the initial amount: \(40 - 26 = 14\) dollars.

Whitney will have $14 left after the purchase.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Whitney has decided to buy. 

- The cost of 2 posters is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).
- The cost of 3 notebooks is \(3 \times 4 = \$12\).
- The cost of 2 bookmarks is \(2 \times 2 = \$4\).

Now, we add these costs together to get the total amount Whitney will spend: 
\[10 + 12 + 4 = \$26\]

Whitney started with two $20 bills, which totals \(2 \times 20 = \$40\).

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount Whitney had gives us the amount of money she has left:
\[40 - 26 = \$14\]

Therefore, Whitney will have $\$14$ left over after the purchase.

- Cost of 3 notebooks: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars
- Cost of 2 bookmarks: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars

Adding these up gives the total cost:

\[ 10 + 12 + 4 = 26 \] dollars

Whitney has two $20 bills to spend, which totals:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \] dollars

Now, to find out how much money Whitney will have left over, we subtract the total cost from the total amount of money Whitney has:

\[ 40 - 26 = 14 \] dollars

Whitney has $20 x 2 = $40 in total. The two posters cost 2 x $5 = $10. Three notebooks cost 3 x $4 = $12. Two bookmarks cost 2 x $2 = $4. Therefore, Whitney’s total cost is $10 + $12 + $4 = $26. Therefore, Whitney will have $40 - $26 = $14 left.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Whitney wants to buy.

For the posters: 2 posters * $5 each = $10
For the notebooks: 3 notebooks * $4 each = $12
For the bookmarks: 2 bookmarks * $2 each = $4

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 + $12 + $4 = $26

Whitney has $20 * 2 = $40 total.

To find out how much money Whitney will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost from the total amount of money she has: $40 - $26 = $14.

Therefore, Whitney will have $14 left over after her purchase.

To determine how much money Whitney will have left after her purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she plans to buy and then subtract that from the total amount of money she has.

1. Calculate the cost of the posters: \(2 \text{ posters} \times \$5 \text{ per poster} = \$10\).
2. Calculate the cost of the notebooks: \(3 \text{ notebooks} \times \$4 \text{ per notebook} = \$12\).
3. Calculate the cost of the bookmarks: \(2 \text{ bookmarks} \times \$2 \text{ per bookmark} = \$4\).

Adding these amounts together, the total cost of all the items Whitney is buying is:
\[
\$10 + \$12 + \$4 = \$26.
\]

Whitney has two $20 bills, which means she has a total of:
\[
2 \times \$20 = \$40.
\]

Subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount of money she has:
\[
\$40 - \$26 = \$14.

Therefore, Whitney will have \$14 left over after the purchase.

To determine how much money Whitney will have left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract it from the total amount of money she has.

1. Calculate the cost of the posters: 
   - Each poster costs $5, and she wants to buy 2 posters.
   - Total cost for posters = $5 × 2 = $10.

2. Calculate the cost of the notebooks: 
   - Each notebook costs $4, and she wants to buy 3 notebooks.
   - Total cost for notebooks = $4 × 3 = $12.

3. Calculate the cost of the bookmarks: 
   - Each bookmark costs $2, and she wants to buy 2 bookmarks.
   - Total cost for bookmarks = $2 × 2 = $4.

4. Add up the total cost of all items: 
   - Total cost = cost of posters + cost of notebooks + cost of bookmarks
   - Total cost = $10 + $12 + $4 = $26.

5. Determine the total amount of money Whitney initially has: 
   - Whitney’s mom gave her two $20 bills, so the total is $20 + $20 = $40.

6. Subtract the total cost from the initial amount to find out how much money Whitney will have left: 
   - Money left = total amount - total cost
   - Money left = $40 - $26 = $14.

So, Whitney will have $14 left over after her purchases.
