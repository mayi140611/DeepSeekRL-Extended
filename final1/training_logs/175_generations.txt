###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Conner has a dune buggy that he rides in the desert.  On flat sand, it can ride at a speed of 60 miles per hour.  When traveling on downhill slopes, it can race at 12 miles per hour faster than it can when it is on flat sand.  And when riding on an uphill inclined slow, it travels at a speed 18 miles per hour slower than when it is riding on flat sand.  If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes, what is his average speed in miles per hour?

system
Let the time spent on flat sand be $t$ hours and on each of the uphill and downhill sections be $\frac{t}{3}$ hours. 

The speed on flat sand is 60 mph, on uphill is 60 - 18 = 42 mph, and on downhill is 60 + 12 = 72 mph.

The average speed is given by:
\[
\frac{t \cdot 60 + \frac{t}{3} \cdot 42 + \frac{t}{3} \cdot 72}{t + \frac{t}{3} + \frac{t}{3}} 
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
= \frac{60t + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 72t + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 42t}{\frac{10}{3}t}
\]

\[
= \frac{60t + \frac{288}{3}t + \frac{126}{3}t}{\frac{10}{3}t}
\]

\[
= \frac{60t + 96t + 42t}{\frac{10}{3}t}
\]

\[
= \frac{198t}{\frac{10}{3}t}
\]

\[
= \frac{198 \cdot 3}{10} 
\]

\[
= \frac{594}{10} 
\]

\[
= 59.4
\]

So, the average speed is $59.4$ mph.

Let's denote Conner's speed on flat sand as \( S_f = 60 \) mph, on downhill slopes as \( S_d = S_f + 12 = 72 \) mph, and on uphill slopes as \( S_u = S_f - 18 = 42 \) mph.

Since he rides for one-third of the time on each type of terrain, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{S_f \cdot \frac{1}{3} + S_d \cdot \frac{1}{3} + S_u \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}(60) + \frac{1}{3}(72) + \frac{1}{3}(42)}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}(60 + 72 + 42)}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}(174)}{\frac{1}{3}} = 174 \text{ mph}

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the speed on uphill as \( U \), on flat sand as \( F = 60 \) MPH, and on downhill as \( D = F + 12 = 72 \) MPH. The times are one third of the time on flat sand, one third of the time on uphill, and one third of the time on downhill. Speed is equal to distance divided by time, and the total distance is the same regardless of the terrain, so we don't need to calculate distances directly.

The average speed \( S_{\text{avg}} \) can be found with equation:

\[ S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{time on flat sand} \times \text{speed on flat sand} + \text{time on uphill} \times \text{speed on uphill} + \text{time on downhill} \times \text{speed on downhill}}{\text{total time}} \]

Since the total time is one third each on flat sand, uphill, and downhill, we can write out and simplify:

\[ S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\left(3\left(\frac{1}{3} \times 60 + \frac{1}{3} \times U + \frac{1}{3} \times 72\right)\right) \times 60}{1} \]

Simplifying the fractions:

\[ S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{60U + 1240}{3} \]

\[ S_{\text{avg}} = 20U + \frac{413.33}{3} \]

However, we don't have the value for \( U \), the uphill speed, to simplify further. No additional information is given and is required to calculate the final average speed.

\[ S_{\text{avg}} = 20U + \frac{413.33}{3} \]

To find Conner's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The average speed is then the total distance divided by the total time.

1. **Determine Conner's speeds on each type of terrain:**
   - Flat sand: 60 mph
   - Downhill: \(60 + 12 = 72\) mph
   - Uphill: \(60 - 18 = 42\) mph

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   Since Conner travels one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third on uphill slopes, and one-third on downhill slopes, the distribution of time (and thus distance for each terrain) will be the same.

   \[
   \text{Distance on each terrain} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total distance}
   \]
   Let \(D\) be the total distance traveled.

   \[
   \text{Distance on flat sand} = \frac{1}{3}D
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance on uphill slopes} = \frac{1}{3}D
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance on downhill slopes} = \frac{1}{3}D
   \]

3. **Calculate the time taken for each terrain:**
   - Time on flat sand: 
     \[
     \text{Time on flat sand} = \frac{D/3}{60} = \frac{D}{180} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time on uphill slopes:
     \[
     \text{Time on uphill slopes} = \frac{D/3}{42} = \frac{D}{126} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time on downhill slopes:
     \[
     \text{Time on downhill slopes} = \frac{D/3}{72} = \frac{D}{216} \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{D}{180} + \frac{D}{126} + \frac{D}{216}
   \]
   To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 180, 126, and 216 is 3780.

   \[
   \frac{D}{180} = \frac{2D}{3780}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{D}{126} = \frac{3D}{3780}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{D}{216} = \frac{1D}{3780}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{2D}{3780} + \frac{3D}{3780} + \frac{1D}{3780} = \frac{6D}{3780} = \frac{D}{630} \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate the average speed:**
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{630}} = 630 \text{ mph}
   \]

Let's denote the average speed on flat sand as \( S_f \), on downhill as \( S_d \), and on uphill as \( S_u \).

Given:
- \( S_f = 60 \) mph (flat sand speed)
- \( S_d = S_f + 12 \) mph (downhill speed)
- \( S_u = S_f - 18 \) mph (uphill speed)

Now, calculate each speed:
- \( S_d = 60 + 12 = 72 \) mph

Both \( S_f \) and \( S_u \) are consistent:
- \( S_f = 60 \) mph
- \( S_u = 60 - 18 = 42 \) mph

Conner rides 1/3 of the time on each of the three types of terrain:
- Time on flat sand: \( T_f = \frac{1}{3} \) hours
- Time on downhill: \( T_d = \frac{1}{3} \) hours
- Time on uphill: \( T_u = \frac{1}{3} \) hours

Now, calculate the total distance covered in a single trip:
- Distance on flat sand: \( D_f = S_f \times T_f \)
- Distance on downhill: \( D_d = S_d \times T_d \)
- Distance on uphill: \( D_u = S_u \times T_u \)

Plugging in the values:
- \( D_f = 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) miles
- \( D_d = 72 \times \frac{1}{3} = 24 \) miles
- \( D_u = 42 \times \frac{1}{3} = 14 \) miles

The total distance traveled in a single trip is:
\[ D = D_f + D_d + D_u = 20 + 24 + 14 = 58 \text{ miles} \]

The total time taken for the trip is:
\[ T = T_f + T_d + T_u = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{58 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 58 \text{ mph} \]

To find Conner's average speed, we need to determine the total distance he travels in each condition and then find the total time taken. Since we do not have the total distance, we will use the given speeds and the fractions of time.

Given:
Speed on flat sand = 60 mph
Speed on downhill = 60 + 12 = 72 mph
Speed on uphill = 60 - 18 = 42 mph

Let the total time spent on flat sand, uphill slopes, and downhill slopes be \( T \) hours each.

Total speed = (60 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (42 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (72 \times \frac{1}{3})
            = 20 + 14 + 24
            = 58 mph

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.

Total distance = 58 hours \(\times\) Total distance per hour
Total distance = 58 hours \(\times\) (Total distance per hour)

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 58 mph

Let's calculate the speed for each part of the journey:

1. **On flat sand:** Conner's speed is 60 mph.
2. **On uphill slope:** He travels 18 mph slower than on flat sand, so his speed is \(60 - 18 = 42\) mph.
3. **On downhill slope:** He travels 12 mph faster than on flat sand, so his speed is \(60 + 12 = 72\) mph.

Since we know he rides each part of his journey one-third of the time, we will calculate the average speed by summing up all the speeds and dividing by 3.

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Speed on flat sand} \times \frac{1}{3} + \text{Speed on uphill slope} \times \frac{1}{3} + \text{Speed on downhill slope} \times \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}}
