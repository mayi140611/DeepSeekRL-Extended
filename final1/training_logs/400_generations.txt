###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Kimberley, Ela, and Houston all are sent to collect firewood by their grammy. Kimberley collects ten pounds of firewood, and Houston collects 12 pounds of firewood. If the three of them managed to collect a total of 35 pounds of firewood, how many pounds were collected by Ela?

Let's denote the amount of firewood collected by Ela as \( E \).

According to the problem, the total amount of firewood collected by Kimberley, Ela, and Houston is 35 pounds. Kimberley collected 10 pounds of firewood, and Houston collected 12 pounds of firewood. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 10 + E + 12 = 35 \]

Combining the known amounts, we get:

\[ 10 + 12 + E = 35 \]
\[ 22 + E = 35 \]

Subtracting 22 from both sides to solve for \( E \):

\[ E = 35 - 22 \]
\[ E = 13 \]

Therefore, Ela collected 13 pounds of firewood.

<reasoning>
In the previous reasoning, we initially misunderstood the problem. The correct way to set up the equation is to consider the total wood collected by all three individuals. Kimberley collected 10 pounds, Houston collected 12 pounds, and Ela collected \( E \) pounds. The total was given as 35 pounds. We then subtract the wood collected by Kimberley and Houston from the total to get the amount collected by Ela, which is \( 35 - (10 + 12) = 13 \).

To find out how many pounds of firewood Ela collected, we can subtract the amount of firewood collected by Kimberley and Houston from the total amount.

Total amount of firewood collected by Kimberley and Houston = 10 pounds + 12 pounds = 22 pounds

Total amount of firewood collected by all three = 35 pounds

Now we can calculate the amount collected by Ela.

Amount collected by Ela = Total amount of firewood collected - Total amount of firewood collected by Kimberley and Houston
Amount collected by Ela = 35 pounds - 22 pounds = 13 pounds

So, Ela collected 13 pounds of firewood.

To find out how many pounds of firewood Ela collected, we need to subtract the amount collected by Kimberley and Houston from the total amount collected.

Total amount collected: 35 pounds
Amount collected by Kimberley: 10 pounds
Amount collected by Houston: 12 pounds

Apa yang membuat rumus ini bekerja? 

35 - 10 - 12 = 13 pounds
Ella adalah yang terakhir yang pergi. Jadi, jumlah yang perlu dikurang adalah 35 dan 10 dan 12. 13 pounds adalah jumlah yang tersisa.

<answer>

</answer>
<reasoning>
The total amount collected is 35 pounds, Kimberley collected 10 pounds and Houston collected 12 pounds, so the amount collected by Ela must be 35 - 10 - 12 = 13 pounds.

To find out how many pounds of firewood Ela collected, we start by noting the total amount collected by all three and the amount collected by Kimberley and Houston.

We know the total amount collected is 35 pounds, and Kimberley collected 10 pounds and Houston collected 12 pounds. Let \( E \) represent the amount collected by Ela. The equation representing the total collection is:

\[10 + 12 + E = 35\]

We can simplify this equation:

\[22 + E = 35\]

Next, we solve for \( E \):

\[E = 35 - 22\]

\[E = 13\]

So, Ela collected 13 pounds of firewood.

To determine how many pounds of firewood Ela collected, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of firewood collected**: We know from the problem statement that the total amount of firewood collected by Kimberley, Ela, and Houston is 35 pounds.

2. **Identify the amount of firewood collected by Kimberley and Houston**:
   - Kimberley collected 10 pounds of firewood.
   - Houston collected 12 pounds of firewood.

3. **Calculate the combined amount collected by Kimberley and Houston**:
   \[
   10 \text{ (Kimberley's collection)} + 12 \text{ (Houston's collection)} = 22 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine Ela's collection by subtracting the combined amount from the total**:
   - Let \( E \) represent the amount of firewood collected by Ela.
   - According to the problem, the total for all three is 35 pounds:
     \[
     E + 22 \text{ (Kimberley's and Houston's combined)} = 35 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Solve for Ela's collection**:
   \[
   E = 35 - 22
   \]
   \[
   E = 13
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: Ela collected 13 pounds of firewood.

Therefore, the number of pounds collected by Ela is \(\boxed{13}\).

To find out how many pounds of firewood Ela collected, we need to subtract the amounts collected by Kimberley and Houston from the total collected by all three. 

The total amount collected by Kimberley and Houston is 10 + 12 = 22 pounds.
Since the total collected by all three was 35 pounds, subtracting Kimberley's and Houston's amounts from the total gives us the amount collected by Ela.

35 pounds (total collected) - 22 pounds (Kimberley and Houston) = 13 pounds (Ela's collection).

To find out how many pounds of firewood Ela collected, we first need to find out how much firewood Kimberley and Houston collected together and then subtract that from the total amount collected.

Kimberley collected 10 pounds.
Houston collected 12 pounds.
Together, they collected 10 + 12 = 22 pounds of firewood.

The total amount collected by all three of them was 35 pounds.

So, Ela must have collected the remaining amount after subtracting the combined amount of Kim and Houston's firewood. 

Ela collected \(35 - 22 = 13\) pounds of firewood.

Let's denote the pounds of firewood collected by Ela as \( E \).

According to the problem, Kimberley collected 10 pounds, Houston collected 12 pounds, and Ela collected \( E \) pounds. The total weight collected by all three is 35 pounds. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 10 + 12 + E = 35 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 22 + E = 35 \]

To find \( E \), we need to subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:

\[ E = 35 - 22 \]
\[ E = 13 \]

So, Ela collected 13 pounds of firewood.

To find out how many pounds of firewood Ela collected, we can use the information given:

1) Kimberley collected 10 pounds of firewood.
2) Houston collected 12 pounds of firewood.
3) The total collected by all three was 35 pounds.

We can set up an equation to represent the total amount of firewood collected:

\[ \text{Kimberley's amount} + \text{Ela's amount} + \text{Houston's amount} = \text{Total amount} \]

\[ 10 + \text{Ela's amount} + 12 = 35 \]

Now, let's solve for Ela's amount:

\[ 22 + \text{Ela's amount} = 35 \]

Subtract 22 from both sides:

\[ \text{Ela's amount} = 35 - 22 \]

\[ \text{Ela's amount} = 13 \]

Let's denote the pounds of firewood collected by Ela as E.

From the problem, we know:
- Kimberley collected 10 pounds of firewood.
- Houston collected 12 pounds of firewood.
- The total collection by all three is 35 pounds.

So, we can write the equation:

\[ E + 10 + 12 = 35 \]

To find E, we need to solve this equation.

\[ E + 22 = 35 \]

Subtract 22 from both sides:

\[ E = 35 - 22 \]

\[ E = 13 \]
