###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

The county fair was hosting a pumpkin contest to see who could grow the biggest pumpkin in pounds.  Brad entered his pumpkin with a weight of 54 pounds.  Jessica's was half the weight of Brad's.  Betty's pumpkin weight 4 times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin.  What is the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin in  pounds?

First, let's determine the weights of the pumpkins entered by Jessica and Betty. Jessica's pumpkin is half the weight of Brad's, so it weighs 54 / 2 = 27 pounds. Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the amount of Jessica's, so it weighs 27 * 4 = 108 pounds. Now we know the weights of all three pumpkins: Brad's is 54 pounds, Jessica's is 27 pounds, and Betty's is 108 pounds. The heaviest pumpkin is Betty's, which weighs 108 pounds, and the lightest is Jessica's, which weighs 27 pounds. The difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin is the heaviest minus the lightest, which is 108 - 27 = 81 pounds.

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####

<reasoning>
To find the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin, we need to determine the weight of each pumpkin:

1. Brad's pumpkin: 54 pounds
2. Jessica's pumpkin: 1/2 of Brad's, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \) pounds
3. Betty's pumpkin: 4 times Jessica's, which is \( 4 \times 27 = 108 \) pounds

Now, we can compare these weights to find the heaviest and lightest:

- Heaviest pumpkin: Betty's pumpkin (108 pounds)
- Lightest pumpkin: Jessica's pumpkin (27 pounds)

To find the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin, we subtract the lightest from the heaviest:

\( 108 - 27 = 81 \) pounds

Therefore, the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin is 81 pounds.

Let's start by calculating the weight of each pumpkin:

1. Brad's pumpkin: 54 pounds
2. Jessica's pumpkin: Since it is half the weight of Brad's, it is \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) pounds.
3. Betty's pumpkin: Since it is 4 times the weight of Jessica's, it is \( 4 \times 27 = 108 \) pounds.

Now we know:
- Brad's pumpkin = 54 pounds
- Jessica's pumpkin = 27 pounds
- Betty's pumpkin = 108 pounds

The heaviest pumpkin is Betty's and the lightest is Jessica's. Therefore, the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin is \( 108 - 27 = 81 \) pounds.

To find the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin, we need to first determine the weights of Jessica's and Betty's pumpkins.

3. Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the weight of Jessica's, so Betty's pumpkin weighs \( 4 \times 27 = 108 \) pounds.

Now, we compare Brad's 54 pounds, Jessica's 27 pounds, and Betty's 108 pounds. Betty's pumpkin is the heaviest, whereas Brad's is the lightest. The difference between Betty's and Brad's pumpkins is \( 108 - 54 = 54 \) pounds.

Therefore, the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin is \( 54 \) pounds.

To find out the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin, we need to calculate the weight of each pumpkin.

Brad's pumpkin weighs 54 pounds.

Jessica's pumpkin is half the weight of Brad's, so its weight is:
\( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) pounds.

Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the amount of Jessica's, so its weight is:
\( 4 \times 27 = 108 \) pounds.

Now we compare Brad's pumpkin (54 pounds) with Betty's pumpkin (108 pounds) to find the difference:
\( 108 - 54 = 54 \) pounds.

So, the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin is 54 pounds.

Jessica's pumpkin is half the weight of Brad's, so it weighs 54/2 = 27 pounds. Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times Jessica's weight, so it weighs 27*4 = 108 pounds. To find the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin, we need to subtract the weight of Brad's pumpkin from the weight of Betty's pumpkin. 108 - 54 = 54 pounds.

We'll start by calculating the weight of Jessica's pumpkin. Since Jessica's pumpkin is half the weight of Brad's, we can calculate Jessica's pumpkin's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Jessica's weight} = \frac{\text{Brad's weight}}{2} = \frac{54 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we'll calculate the weight of Betty's pumpkin. Betty's pumpkin weighs four times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin, so:

\[ \text{Betty's weight} = 4 \times \text{Jessica's weight} = 4 \times 27 = 108 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin. The heaviest is Betty's pumpkin at 108 pounds, and the lightest is Jessica's at 27 pounds. Thus, the difference is:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Betty's weight} - \text{Jessica's weight} = 108 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 81 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin is 81 pounds.

To find the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin, we first need to determine the weights of each participant's pumpkin.

First, we know that Brad's pumpkin weighs 54 pounds.

Next, we are given that Jessica's pumpkin is half the weight of Brad's. Therefore, we calculate Jessica's pumpkin weight as follows:
- Jessica's pumpkin weight = \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) pounds.

Then, we are told that Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin. Therefore, we calculate Betty's pumpkin weight as follows:
- Betty's pumpkin weight = \( 4 \times 27 = 108 \) pounds.

Now we know the weight of each pumpkin:
- Brad's pumpkin weight = 54 pounds
- Jessica's pumpkin weight = 27 pounds
- Betty's pumpkin weight = 108 pounds

Among these weights, Betty's pumpkin is the heaviest, and Jessica's pumpkin is the lightest. The difference between the heaviest and the lightest pumpkin is calculated as follows:
- Difference in weights = \( 108 - 27 = 81 \) pounds

Therefore, the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin is 81 pounds.

First, let's determine the weights of Jessica's and Betty's pumpkins based on the information given:

1. Brad's pumpkin has a weight of 54 pounds.
2. Jessica's pumpkin is half the weight of Brad's, so Jessica's pumpkin weighs \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) pounds.
3. Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the amount of Jessica's, so Betty's pumpkin weighs \( 4 \times 27 = 108 \) pounds.

Now, we have the weights of Brad's, Jessica's, and Betty's pumpkins:
- Brad: 54 pounds
- Jessica: 27 pounds
- Betty: 108 pounds

The heaviest pumpkin weighs 108 pounds (Betty's), and the lightest pumpkin weighs 27 pounds (Jessica's).

To find the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin, we subtract the weight of the lightest from the weight of the heaviest:
