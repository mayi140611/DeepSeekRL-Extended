John buys 200 pounds of burgers at $3 per pound so they cost 200*$3=$600
He also buys a condiments and propane kit for $80
The total cost of the burgers, condiment kit and propane is $600+$80=$680
John and his friends split the cost of the burgers, condiment kit, propane and alcohol equally so John pays a third which is $680/3=$226.67
John also buys the alcohol which cost $200 so he is out $226.67+$200=$426.67

John splits the cost of the burgers with 3 other people, so he pays for \(\frac{100 \text{ pounds} \times \$3/\text{pound}}{4} = \$75\) worth of burgers. Adding the condiments and propane cost, John pays for \(\$75 + \$80 = \$155\). Additionally, John buys alcohol which costs \$200. Therefore, John spends \(\$155 + \$200 = \$355\) altogether.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####

system
John splits the cost with 3 other people, so initially, each person pays for $\frac{100 \text{ pounds of burgers}}{4 \text{ people}} = 25 \text{ pounds of burgers}$.
Since the cost of $25 \text{ pounds of burgers}$ is $25 \text{ pounds} \times $ (\$3/pound) = $75, John and the other 3 people split this cost, which means each person pays $75/4 = $18.75 for the burgers.
Adding the condiments and propane, the total of John's payments so far is $18.75 + $80 = $98.75.
Finally, adding the cost of the alcohol, John spends a total of $98.75 + $200 = $298.75.

John and his 3 friends split the cost for the burgers, which amounts to $3 per pound times 100 pounds, which totals to $300. They also spend $80 on condiments and propane, which equals a total of $380. Adding John's share of the burger cost, a total of $380 + $300 = $680. Then, we must add the cost of alcohol which is $200. Therefore, John spends $680 + $200 = $880 altogether.

John splits the cost of the burgers and condiments with 3 people, so the total cost of the burgers and condiments is $80. Now, we have to calculate the cost of all the burgers, which is 100 pounds at $3 per pound, so 100 * $3 = $300. Adding all these to the cost of the alcohol, we get $300 + $30 + $80 + $200 = $680. John splits the cost with 3 other people, so he pays a total of $680 / 4 = $170.

Since John splits the cost with 3 other people, they split the total cost of the burgers and condiments and propane equally. 

The total cost for the burgers and condiments and propane is 100 pounds * $3/pound + $80 = $300 + $80 = $380 split among 4 people, which means each person, including John, spends $380 / 4 = $95.

John also spends $200 on alcohol, so the total amount John spends is $95 on burgers and condiments/propane + $200 on alcohol = $295.
