#### GENERATION 10 RESPONSE ####


system
Winwin won $50 in a lottery, which includes a tax of 20%.

Mathematically, the amount of tax is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Tax} = \text{Total Winnings} \times \text{Tax Rate} \]
\[ \text{Tax} = \$50 \times 0.20 \]
\[ \text{Tax} = \$10 \]

Therefore, the net amount won after tax is:
\[ \text{Net Winnings} = \text{Total Winnings} - \text{Tax} \]
\[ \text{Net Winnings} = \$50 - \$10 \]
\[ \text{Net Winnings} = \$40 \]

Next, she paid a processing fee of $5.

Therefore, the amount she was able to take home after the tax and processing fee is:
\[ \text{Take Home Amount} = \text{Net Winnings} - \text{Processing Fee} \]
\[ \text{Take Home Amount} = \$40 - \$5 \]
\[ \text{Take Home Amount} = \$35 \]

#### GENERATION 14 RESPONSE ####


system
Step 1: Calculate the tax amount
Winwin paid 20% of $50 as tax, so we calculate 20% of $50.

Tax = 20/100 * $50 = $10

Step 2: Calculate the total amount after tax
Total after tax = Amount won - Tax
Total after tax = $50 - $10 = $40

Step 3: Subtract the processing fee
Processing fee = $5

Total after tax and processing fee = Total after tax - Processing fee
Total after tax and processing fee = $40 - $5 = $35

Step 4: Calculate the final amount Winwin was able to take home
Winwin was able to take home $35.
