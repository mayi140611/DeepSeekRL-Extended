To find out how many skips Roberto and Valerie will make in 15 minutes, we need to calculate their individual rates of skipping and then multiply by the duration of 15 minutes.

First, let's calculate how many skips Roberto can do in 15 minutes. Roberto can skip 4,200 times per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find out how many skips Roberto does in 15 minutes by dividing 15 into the hourly rate:

4,200 skips/hour ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 70 skips/minute

Now, we multiply this by 15 minutes:

70 skips/minute × 15 minutes = 1,050 skips

Next, let's calculate how many skips Valerie can do in 15 minutes. Valerie skips 80 times per minute. 

80 skips/minute × 15 minutes = 1,200 skips

Now we add the number of skips they both make together:

Roberto's skips: 1,050
Valerie's skips: 1,200
Total skips: 1,050 + 1,200 = 2,250 skips

Therefore, in 15 minutes, they will total 2,250 skips.

To determine the total number of skips, we first need to calculate the number of skips each person can perform in fifteen minutes.

Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate how many skips he can do in one minute:
\[ 4,200 \div 60 = 70 \text{ skips per minute} \]
Now, we can find out how many skips Roberto can do in fifteen minutes:
\[ 70 \times 15 = 1,050 \text{ skips} \]

Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. To find out how many skips she can do in fifteen minutes, we multiply her rate by the number of minutes:
\[ 80 \times 15 = 1,200 \text{ skips} \]

Next, we add the total number of skips from both Roberto and Valerie:
\[ 1,050 + 1,200 = 2,250 \text{ skips} \]

So, their total skips is:

To find the total number of skips, we need to calculate the skips per hour for both Roberto and Valerie, then multiply by the number of minutes they jump rope.

Roberto skips 4,200 times an hour. Valerie skips 80 times a minute. Therefore, she skips:

80 skips/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 4,800 skips/hour

Now they jump for 15 minutes. So, the total number of skips for each is:

Roberto: 4,200 skips/hour * 15 minutes = 63,000 skips
Valerie: 4,800 skips/hour * 15 minutes = 72,000 skips

Total skips for both Roberto and Valerie:
63,000 + 72,000 = 135,000 skips

Roberto skips at a rate of 4,200 skips per hour. Since they are jumping for 15 minutes, we first need to find out how many skips Roberto completes in 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 15 minutes, Roberto completes:

\[ \frac{4,200 \text{ skips}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 105 \times 15 = 1,575 \text{ skips} \]

Valerie skips at a rate of 80 skips per minute, so in 15 minutes, Valerie will:

\[ 80 \text{ skips/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,200 \text{ skips} \]

The total number of skips by both Roberto and Valerie combined is:

\[ 1,575 \text{ skips} + 1,200 \text{ skips} = 2,775 \text{ skips} \]

To calculate the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie will make, we need to find out how many skips each can make in fifteen minutes and then add them together.

First, let's calculate how many skips Roberto makes in fifteen minutes:
Roberto skips 4,200 times an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate how many skips he makes in five minutes:
4,200 skips per hour ÷ 60 minutes = 70 skips per minute.
Therefore, in fifteen minutes, Roberto makes:
70 skips per minute × 15 minutes = 1,050 skips.

Next, let's calculate how many skips Valerie makes in fifteen minutes:
Valerie skips 80 times a minute, so in fifteen minutes she makes:
80 skips per minute × 15 minutes = 1,200 skips.

Now we add their skips together:
Roberto's skips + Valerie's skips = 1,050 + 1,200 = 2,250 skips.

So, they will total 2,250 skips in fifteen minutes.

First, calculate the number of skips Roberto can complete in fifteen minutes. Roberto skips 4,200 times per hour, so in a minute, he skips \( \frac{4,200}{60} = 70 \) times. Therefore, in fifteen minutes, he skips \( 70 \times 15 = 1,050 \) times.

Next, calculate the number of skips Valerie can complete in fifteen minutes. Valerie skips 80 times per minute, so in fifteen minutes, she skips \( 80 \times 15 = 1,200 \) times.

Now, add the total number of skips from both Roberto and Valerie. Roberto skips 1,050 times and Valerie skips 1,200 times, so together they skip \( 1,050 + 1,200 = 2,250 \) times in fifteen minutes.

To find out the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie will make, we first need to calculate how many skips each of them can do in 15 minutes.

Roberto can jump rope at 4,200 skips per hour. In 15 minutes, which is a quarter of an hour, he would be able to skip:
\[ 4200 \text{ skips/hour} \times \frac{15 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 1050 \text{ skips/minute} \]

Valerie can skip 80 times per minute. In 15 minutes, she would be able to skip:
\[ 80 \text{ skips/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1200 \text{ skips} \]

Now, we add the skips made by Roberto and Valerie to get the total skips:

To find the total number of skips both Roberto and Valerie will have made in fifteen minutes, we'll calculate the number of skips each can make in that time period separately and then add those numbers together.

1. For Roberto:
   Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate his skips per minute and then for 15 minutes:
   \[
   \text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{4,200}{60} = 70
   \]
   \[
   \text{Roberto's skips in 15 minutes} = 70 \times 15 = 1,050
   \]

2. For Valerie:
   Valerie skips 80 times a minute. So if she jumps for 15 minutes:
   \[
   \text{Valerie's skips in 15 minutes} = 80 \times 15 = 1,200
   \]

Finally, to find the total number of skips the two of them made together in 15 minutes, we add their individual totals:
\[
\text{Total skips} = \text{Roberto's skips} + \text{Valerie's skips} = 1,050 + 1,200 = 2,250

To find the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie will make in fifteen minutes, we need to calculate the skips each of them can do in that time.

First, let's calculate the number of skips Roberto can do in fifteen minutes. Since Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour, we need to find out how many skips he can do in a minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{4200}{60} \]

\[ \text{Roberto's skips per minute} = 70 \]

Now, we multiply this by 15 minutes:

\[ \text{Roberto's total skips} = 70 \times 15 = 1050 \]

Next, for Valerie, we know she can skip 80 times per minute. So:

\[ \text{Valerie's skips per minute} = 80 \]

\[ \text{Valerie's total skips} = 80 \times 15 = 1200 \]

Now we add their skips together:

\[ \text{Total skips} = \text{Roberto's skips} + \text{Valerie's skips} \]

\[ \text{Total skips} = 1050 + 1200 = 2250 \]

To determine the total number of skips that Roberto and Valerie will make in fifteen minutes, we need to calculate how many skips each of them can do in that time and then add those numbers together.

First, let's find out how many skips Roberto can do in fifteen minutes. We know that Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert his skipping rate into skips per minute by dividing 4,200 by 60:

\[ \text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{4200}{60} = 70 \]

Now, since Roberto is jumping for fifteen minutes, we can find out the total number of skips he can do by multiplying his skips per minute by 15:

\[ \text{Roberto's total skips} = 70 \times 15 = 1050 \]

Next, let's calculate how many skips Valerie can do in the same fifteen minutes. We know that Valerie skips 80 times a minute, so in 15 minutes, she will skip:

\[ \text{Valerie's total skips} = 80 \times 15 = 1200 \]

Now, to find the total number of skips done by both Roberto and Valerie, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total skips} = 1050 + 1200 = 2250 \]

Therefore, the total number of skips they will make together in fifteen minutes is 2250.

To find the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie can perform in 15 minutes, we need to calculate the skips per minute for each of them and then multiply by the number of minutes.

For Roberto, we know he can skip 4,200 times in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the skips per minute as follows:
\[ \text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{\text{Roberto's skips per hour}}{60} = \frac{4200}{60} = 70 \]

For Valerie, we know she can skip 80 times a minute. So for 15 minutes, the number of skips is:

To determine the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie will make in 15 minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Roberto's skips in 15 minutes:**
   - Roberto skips at a rate of 4,200 times per hour.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - To find how many times Roberto skips in 15 minutes, we use the proportion:
     \[
     \text{Roberto's skips in 15 minutes} = \frac{4200 \text{ skips/hour}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} \times 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     = 70 \text{ skips/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     = 1050 \text{ skips}
     \]

2. **Calculate Valerie's skips in 15 minutes:**
   - Valerie skips at a rate of 80 times per minute.
   - To find how many times Valerie skips in 15 minutes, we use the rate directly:
     \[
     \text{Valerie's skips in 15 minutes} = 80 \text{ skips/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     = 1200 \text{ skips}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total skips:**
   - Add the skips made by Roberto and Valerie together:
     \[
     \text{Total skips} = \text{Roberto's skips} + \text{Valerie's skips}
     \]
     \[
     = 1050 \text{ skips} + 1200 \text{ skips}
