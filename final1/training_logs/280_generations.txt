The total cost of the cards from the first box is \(6 \times \$1.25 = \$7.50\).

The total cost of the cards from the second box is \(6 \times \$1.75 = \$10.50\).

The total cost of all the cards he bought is \(\$7.50 + \$10.50 = \$18.00\).

The cost of cards from the first box is $1.25 per card. Therefore, the total cost for 6 cards is \( 1.25 \times 6 = 7.5 \) dollars. The cost of cards from the second box is $1.75 per card. Therefore, the total cost for 6 cards is \( 1.75 \times 6 = 10.5 \) dollars. The total cost of all cards is \( 7.5 + 10.5 = 18 \) dollars.

The cost of cards from the first box is $1.25 each, so the cost of 6 cards from the first box is 1.25 * 6 = $7.50. The cost of cards from the second box is $1.75 each, so the cost of 6 cards from the second box is 1.75 * 6 = $10.50. The total cost, in dollars, of the cards he bought is the sum of the cost of the cards from the first and the second box, which is 7.50 + 10.50 = $18.00.

The cost of one card from the first box is $1.25. Since the boy bought 6 cards from the first box, the total cost for the first box is \(6 \times 1.25 = 7.5\) dollars. Similarly, the cost of one card from the second box is $1.75. Since the boy bought 6 cards from the second box, the total cost for the second box is \(6 \times 1.75 = 10.5\) dollars. Therefore, the total cost of all the cards the boy bought is \(7.5 + 10.5 = 18\) dollars.

First, we calculate the total cost of the cards bought from the first box. Since each card in the first box costs $1. 25 and the boy buys 6 cards, the total cost for this box is \(6 \times 1. 25 = 7. 50\) dollars. For the second box, the cost is \(6 \times 1. 75 = 10. 50\) dollars. To find the overall total cost, we sum these amounts: \(7. 50 + 10. 50 = 18. 00\) dollars.
