<reasoning>
To determine the total cost of hiring the professionals for the renovation of Kamil's kitchen, we need to calculate the number of hours each professional works and then multiply by their hourly wage.

First, let's find the total number of hours worked by each professional:
- Each professional works 6 hours per day for 7 days.
- Total hours worked per professional = 6 hours/day × 7 days = 42 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost for one professional:
- The hourly wage for one professional is $15.
- Cost for one professional = 42 hours × $15/hour = $630.

Since Kamil hired two professionals, we need to find the total cost for both:
- Total cost for one professional × 2 = $630 × 2 = $1260.

Therefore, the total cost for hiring both professionals is $1260.

To determine the total cost for Kamil to hire the professionals, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each professional.
2. Determine the total payment for each professional.
3. Sum the total payments for both professionals.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours worked by each professional. Since each professional works 6 hours a day for 7 days, the total number of hours each professional works is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the payment for each professional. The payment is $15 per hour. Therefore, the payment for each professional is:
\[ 42 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 630 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are two professionals, the total cost for both professionals is:
\[ 630 \text{ dollars/professional} \times 2 \text{ professionals} = 1260 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Kamil to hire the two professionals is $1260.

To determine the total cost for Kamil to hire the two professionals, we need to calculate the daily wage for one professional, then multiply by the number of days and professionals hired.

1. **Daily wage calculation for one professional:**
   - One professional works 6 hours a day.
   - The hourly wage is $15.

   Therefore, daily wage for one professional:
   \[
   \text{Daily wage} = 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars/day}
   \]

2. **Total wage calculation for two professionals:**
   - There are two professionals.

   Therefore, total daily wage for two professionals:
   \[
   \text{Total daily wage} = 90 \text{ dollars/day} \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars/day}
   \]

3. **Total cost for 7 days:**
   - The professionals work for 7 days.

   Therefore, total cost for 7 days:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 180 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1260 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, it costs Kamil $1260 to hire the two professionals for 7 days.

To calculate the total cost for hiring the professionals, we first need to determine the total number of hours worked by both professionals combined. Since each professional works 6 hours a day for 7 days, the total number of hours each professional works in a week is \(6 \times 7 = 42\) hours. For two professionals, the total number of hours worked in a week is \(42 \times 2 = 84\) hours.

Given that the hourly rate for each professional is $15, the cost for each professional working 84 hours in a week is \(84 \times 15 = 1260\) dollars. Therefore, the total cost for both professionals working 7 days is \(1260 \times 2 = 2520\) dollars.

To calculate the total cost of hiring the two professionals for 6 hours a day for 7 days, we can break the problem down into several steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by one professional in 7 days.
2. Multiply the total hours worked by one professional by the hourly rate to get the cost for one professional.
3. Multiply the cost for one professional by 2 to get the total cost for both professionals.

So the cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (\text{Total number of hours worked by one professional}) \times (\text{Hourly rate}) \times (\text{Number of professionals}) \]

Let's calculate that:

\[ \text{Total number of hours worked by one professional for 7 days} = 6 \text{ hours per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Cost for one professional} = 42 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$630 \]

\[ \text{Total cost for two professionals} = 2 \times \$630 = \$1260 \]

So the total cost Kamil has to pay is \$1260.

To calculate the total cost for Kamil to hire the two professionals, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the daily cost for one professional:
   - One professional works for 6 hours a day.
   - Their hourly wage is $15.
   - Therefore, the daily cost for one professional is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

2. Determine the daily cost for both professionals:
   - Since the two professionals work together, the daily cost for both is \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars.

3. Determine the total cost for 7 days:
   - The cost for one professional over 7 days is \(180 \times 7 = 1260\) dollars.
   - Since Kamil hired two professionals, the total cost for both is \(2 \times 1260 = 2520\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for Kamil to hire the two professionals over 7 days is $2520.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for hiring the two professionals for 7 days, with each working 6 hours a day.

1. First, let's calculate the daily cost for one professional:
\[ \text{Daily cost for one professional} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$90/\text{day} \]

2. Since Kamil hired two professionals, their total daily cost would be:
\[ \text{Total daily cost for two professionals} = 2 \times \$90/\text{day} = \$180/\text{day} \]

3. Now, we need to find the total cost for 7 days:
\[ \text{Total cost for 7 days} = 7 \, \text{days} \times \$180/\text{day} = \$1,260 \]

So, the total cost for hiring the two professionals for 7 days is \$1,260.

To calculate the total cost for Kamil to hire both professionals, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of hours each professional works in a day.
2. Calculate the number of days each professional works.
3. Compute the daily wage for each professional.
4. Sum the total wages for both professionals.

Given:
- Each professional works 6 hours a day.
- Each professional works 7 days a week.
- The wage per hour is $15.

Firstly, for each professional:
- Number of hours worked in a day = 6
- Number of working days in a week = 7
- Total hours worked in a week = number of hours worked/day × number of working days = 6 × 7 = 42 hours

Next, since they work every day, this is the same for each week:
- Daily wage for each professional = number of hours worked/day × wage per hour = 42 hours × $15/hour

Calculate the daily wage for one professional:
- Daily wage = 42 × $15 = $630

Since Kamil hires two professionals:
- Total daily wage for both professionals = 2 × daily wage = 2 × $630 = $1260

Therefore, Kamil will pay $1260 for both professionals to work for 7 days.
