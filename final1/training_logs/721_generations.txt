<reasoning>
Let's calculate the number of toads each person has step by step:

1. Tim has 30 toads.
2. Jim has 20 more toads than Tim, so Jim has \(30 + 20 = 50\) toads.
3. Sarah has twice as many toads as Jim, so Sarah has \(50 \times 2 = 100\) toads.

Now we can state the number of toads Sarah has.

To find out how many toads Sarah has, we need to first figure out how many toads Jim has. We know that Jim has 20 more toads than Tim. Since Tim has 30 toads, Jim has:

\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ toads} \]

Next, we need to determine how many toads Sarah has. The problem states that Sarah has twice as many toads as Jim. Since Jim has 50 toads, Sarah has:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ toads} \]

So, Sarah has 100 toads.

Let's calculate the number of toads each person has step by step:

1. Tim has 30 toads.
2. Jim has 20 more toads than Tim. Therefore, Jim’s toads can be calculated as:
   \[ \text{Jim's toads} = \text{Tim's toads} + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \]
3. Sarah has twice as many toads as Jim. Thus, Sarah’s toads can be calculated as:
   \[ \text{Sarah's toads} = 2 \times \text{Jim's toads} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, Sarah has 100 toads.

To find out how many toads Sarah has, we need to calculate step by step. 

First, we know that Tim has 30 toads. 

Tim has 20 more toads than Jim, so we add 20 to the number of toads Tim has to find out how many toads Jim has:
\[ \text{Jim's toads} = \text{Tim's toads} + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

Sarah has twice as many toads as Jim does, so we multiply the number of toads Jim has by 2 to find out how many Sarah has:
\[ \text{Sarah's toads} = 2 \times \text{Jim's toads} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

To determine how many toads Sarah has, we start by finding out how many toads Jim has. According to the problem, Jim has 20 more toads than Tim. Since Tim has 30 toads, we can calculate the number of toads Jim has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of toads Jim has} = \text{Number of toads Tim has} + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50
\]

Next, we need to find out how many toads Sarah has. The problem states that Sarah has twice as many toads as Jim. Therefore, we multiply the number of toads Jim has by 2:

\[
\text{Number of toads Sarah has} = 2 \times \text{Number of toads Jim has} = 2 \times 50 = 100
\]

So, Sarah has 100 toads.

To determine how many toads Sarah has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many toads Jim has. Since Jim has 20 more toads than Tim, we can calculate this by adding 20 to the number of toads Tim has.
2. Once we know how many toads Jim has, we can find out how many toads Sarah has. Since Sarah has twice as many toads as Jim, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of toads Jim has by 2.

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Tim has 30 toads.
2. Jim has \(30 + 20 = 50\) toads.
3. Sarah has \(50 \times 2 = 100\) toads.

Therefore, Sarah has 100 toads.
