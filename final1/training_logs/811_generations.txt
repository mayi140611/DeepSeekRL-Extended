Initially, Bingley has 5 bracelets. Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets, which is \( \frac{16}{4} = 4 \) bracelets. After receiving these bracelets, Bingley has \( 5 + 4 = 9 \) bracelets. Bingley then gives a third of these to his little sister, which is \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) bracelets. After giving away 3 bracelets, Bingley has \( 9 - 3 = 6 \) bracelets remaining.

1. Bingley starts with 5 bracelets.
2. Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets:
   \( 
   \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 
   \)
3. Therefore, Bingley now has:
   \( 
   5 + 4 = 9 
   \) bracelets.
4. Bingley gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister:
   \( 
   \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 
   \)
5. Therefore, Bingley has:
   \( 
   9 - 3 = 6 
   \) bracelets remaining.

To determine how many bracelets Bingley has remaining, we can break the problem down into a series of steps.

1. **Initial number of bracelets Bingley has:**
   Bingley starts with 5 bracelets.

2. **Bracelets given to Kelly:**
   Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets. This means Kelly gives Bingley:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \text{ bracelets}
   \]
   Adding these to Bingley's initial bracelets:
   \[
   5 + 4 = 9 \text{ bracelets}
   \]

3. **Bracelets given to little sister:**
   Bingley gives a third of his current total (9 bracelets) to his little sister. This means Bingley gives:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ bracelets}
   \]
   Subtracting these from Bingley's total:
   \[
   9 - 3 = 6 \text{ bracelets}
   \]

Therefore, after receiving bracelets from Kelly and giving some to his little sister, Bingley has 6 bracelets remaining.

To determine how many bracelets Bingley has remaining, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many bracelets Kelly gives to Bingley. Since Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of bracelets Kelly gives} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

2. Add the bracelets given by Kelly to Bingley's original 5 bracelets:
\[ \text{Total bracelets Bingley has} = 5 + 4 = 9 \]

3. Bingley then gives a third of his total bracelets to his little sister. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of bracelets Bingley gives to his little sister} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

4. Subtract the bracelets given to his little sister from Bingley's total:
\[ \text{Total bracelets Bingley has remaining} = 9 - 3 = 6 \]

So, Bingley has 6 bracelets remaining.

First, we need to determine how many bracelets Kelly gives to Bingley. Kelly has 16 bracelets, and she gives Bingley a fourth of them, so:
\[ \text{Number of bracelets given by Kelly} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]
After receiving the bracelets from Kelly, Bingley has:
\[ \text{Initial bracelets} + \text{Bracelets given by Kelly} = 5 + 4 = 9 \]
Next, Bingley gives a third of the bracelets he has to his little sister. A third of 9 is:
\[ \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]
So, Bingley gives away 3 bracelets to his little sister, leaving him with:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]
Therefore, Bingley has 6 bracelets remaining.

First, we need to determine how many bracelets Kelly gives to Bingley. Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets, which calculates to:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]
So, Kelly gives Bingley 4 bracelets. Now, Bingley initially has 5 bracelets and receives 4 more from Kelly, so his total grows to:
\[ 5 + 4 = 9 \]
Next, Bingley gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister. Since he now has 9 bracelets, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
So, Bingley gives 3 bracelets away. The number of bracelets remaining with Bingley is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, Bingley has 6 bracelets remaining.

Bingley starts with 5 bracelets. Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets, which means Kelly gives Bingley $16 \div 4 = 4$ bracelets. So Bingley now has $5 + 4 = 9$ bracelets. Bingley then gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister, which means he gives away $9 \div 3 = 3$ bracelets. Thus, Bingley has $9 - 3 = 6$ bracelets remaining.

Bingley starts with 5 bracelets.

Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets. A fourth of 16 is 16/4 = 4 bracelets. So Bingley receives 4 more bracelets.

After receiving bracelets from Kelly, Bingley has 5 (initial) + 4 (given by Kelly) = 9 bracelets.

Bingley then gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister. A third of Bingley's 9 bracelets is 9/3 = 3 bracelets. So Bingley gives away 3 more bracelets.

After giving away bracelets to his little sister, Bingley has 9 (remaining) - 3 (given away) = 6 bracelets.

Therefore, Bingley has 6 bracelets remaining.

Let's start by determining how many bracelets Kelly gives to Bingley. Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \) bracelets.

So, Bingley's initial number of bracelets plus the 4 bracelets he receives from Kelly becomes \( 5 + 4 = 9 \) bracelets.

Next, Bingley gives a third of his remaining bracelets to his little sister. He has 9 bracelets in total before this, so a third of that is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \) bracelets.

Therefore, the number of bracelets Bingley has remaining is \( 9 - 3 = 6 \).

First, we need to determine how many bracelets Kelly gives to Bingley. Kelly has 16 bracelets and gives Bingley a fourth of them, so the number of bracelets Kelly gives to Bingley is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of bracelets Kelly gives} = \frac{16}{4} = 4
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bracelets Bingley has after receiving the 4 bracelets from Kelly. Initially, Bingley has 5 bracelets, and Kelly gives him an additional 4, so the total number of bracelets Bingley has is:
\[
\text{Total bracelets Bingley has} = 5 + 4 = 9
\]

Then, Bingley gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister. A third of Bingley's 9 bracelets is:
\[
\text{Number of bracelets Bingley gives to sister} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
\]

Finally, we need to calculate the number of bracelets Bingley has remaining after giving 3 bracelets to his sister. Initially he had 9 bracelets, and after giving away 3, he has:
\[
\text{Bracelets remaining} = 9 - 3 = 6
\]
