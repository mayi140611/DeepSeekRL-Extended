###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

In Mary's class, there are 25 students. Their teacher told them they could pay $50 each to finance a big science project that they and their society would benefit greatly from. They all paid the full amount except for 4 students, who paid half. How much was the class able to gather together?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
The 21 students paid the full amount of $50 each, which is 21 * $50 = $1050.

The 4 students who paid half each amount to $50 / 2 = $25 each. 

So, they paid $25 * 4 = $100 combined.

Therefore, they able to gather together $1050 + $100 = $1150.

system
First, we calculate the amount paid by the students who paid the full amount. There are 21 students (the class total minus the 4 who paid half), so:

21 students * $50 = $1050

Next, we calculate the amount paid by the 4 students who paid half:

4 students * ($50 / 2) = 4 students * $25 = $100

Now, we add the amounts together to find the total amount gathered:

$1050 (from the full payments) + $100 (from the half payments) = $1150

Therefore, the class was able to gather $1150 together.

Total cost of the project is calculated by considering all 25 students contribute $50 each, which equals to \(25 \times 50\). Since 4 students only paid half, the amount paid by these students is \(4 \times \frac{50}{2}\).

Now calculate the total amount collected:

\[ 25 \times 50 + 4 \times \frac{50}{2} \]

\[ = 1250 + 4 \times 25 \]

\[ = 1250 + 100 \]

\[ = 1350 \]

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####


system
The first step is to calculate the total amount paid by the students who paid the full amount. There are 25 students in total, and 4 paid half, so \(25 - 4 = 21\) students paid $50 each. The total amount paid by these 21 students is \(21 \times 50 = 1050\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total amount paid by the 4 students who paid half. Each of these students paid \(50 \div 2 = 25\) dollars. Therefore, the total amount paid by these 4 students is \(4 \times 25 = 100\) dollars.

To find the total amount gathered by the class, we add the amounts paid by the 21 students and the 4 students: \(1050 + 100 = 1150\) dollars.

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####

First, we need to calculate the total amount paid by the students who paid the full amount. There are 25 students, and 4 of them paid $50 each. So, the total amount paid by these 4 students is:

\[ 4 \times 50 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount paid by the 4 students who paid half. Since each of these students paid $50 (which is the full amount but just half of it), the total amount paid by these 4 students is:

\[ 4 \times 50 / 2 = 100 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both groups to find out how much the class was able to gather together:

\[ 200 + 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the class was able to gather $300 together.

First, calculate the total amount that 21 students paid. Each of these students paid $50:

\[ 21 \text{ students} \times 50 \text{ dollars/student} = 1050 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the amount that the 4 students who paid half of $50:

\[ 4 \text{ students} \times \left( \frac{50 \text{ dollars}}{2} \right) = 4 \times 25 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, sum the amounts paid by the 21 students and the 4 students to find the total amount gathered by the class:

\[ 1050 \text{ dollars} + 100 \text{ dollars} = 1150 \text{ dollars} \]

system
To determine how much the class gathered together, we start by calculating the total amount paid by the students who paid the full amount and the students who paid half.

First, we know there are 21 students who paid the full $50 each. So, the total amount collected from these 21 students is:
\[ 21 \times 50 = 1050 \]

Next, we know that 4 students paid half of $50, which is $25 each. So, the total amount collected from these 4 students is:
\[ 4 \times 25 = 100 \]

Now, we add the two amounts to find the total amount gathered:
\[ 1050 + 100 = 1150 \]

Therefore, the class was able to gather together $1150.

To determine the total amount gathered by Mary's class, we need to calculate the payment from those who paid the full amount and those who paid half.

1. First, calculate the number of students who paid the full amount:
   \[
   25 - 4 = 21
   \]
   So, 21 students paid $50 each.

2. Calculate the amount paid by the 21 students:
   \[
   21 \times 50 = 1050
   \]

3. Next, calculate the amount paid by the 4 students who paid half:
   \[
   4 \times \left(\frac{50}{2}\right) = 4 \times 25 = 100
   \]

4. Finally, add the two amounts together to find the total amount gathered:
   \[
   1050 + 100 = 1150

First, we need to calculate the total amount paid by the students who paid the full amount of $50.

There are 25 - 4 = 21 students who paid the full amount.

So, the total amount paid by the full-paying students is $50 * 21 = $1050.

Next, we calculate the total amount paid by the students who paid half of $50, which is $25.

So, the total amount paid by the half-paying students is $25 * 4 = $100.

Finally, we add the two totals to find the total amount collected by the class.

$1050 + $100 = $1150.

Therefore, the class was able to gather together $1150.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 25 students in total.
2. 4 students paid half the amount, which is $25, while the rest (21 students) paid the full amount, which is $50 each.
3. To find out how much the class was able to gather together, we need to calculate the total from the 21 students who paid the full amount and the 4 students who paid half.

Total from students paying the full amount:
21 students * $50/student = $1050

Total from students paying half:
4 students * $25/student = $100

Now, we add these two amounts together:
$1050 + $100 = $1150

Therefore, the class was able to gather together $1150.
