system
The length of the flowerbed is twice its width minus 1 meter, which is \(2 \times 4 - 1 = 7\) meters. The perimeter of the flowerbed is given by the formula \(2 \times \text{length} + \text{width} = 2 \times 7 + 4 = 18\) meters.

To determine the perimeter of the rectangular flowerbed, we need to identify its length and width first.

1. **Identify the width:**
   The width \( w \) is given as 4 meters.

2. **Calculate the length:**
   The length \( l \) is described as 1 meter less than twice the width. Therefore:
   \[
   l = 2 \times w - 1
   \]
   Substituting the width:
   \[
   l = 2 \times 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (l + w)
   \]
   Substituting the values of length and width:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (7 + 4) = 2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ meters}
   \]

Thus, the government needs **22 meters** of fence.

To determine the amount of fence needed for the rectangular flowerbed, we first need to find the dimensions of the flowerbed. We know that the flowerbed is 4 meters wide and its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. Let's denote the length of the flowerbed as \( L \).

Given:
- Width \( W = 4 \) meters
- Length \( L \) is 1 meter less than twice the width, so \( L = 2 \times W - 1 \).

First, calculate the length:
\[ L = 2 \times 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \text{ meters} \]

Now we have the dimensions of the flowerbed: width = 4 meters, and length = 7 meters.

The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we found:
\[ P = 2 \times (7 + 4) = 2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the amount of fence needed is 22 meters.

To find out how many meters of fence are needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular flowerbed. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given that the width \( w \) of the flowerbed is 4 meters, and the length \( l \) is 1 meter less than twice the width, we can express the length as:

\[ l = 2w - 1 \]

Substituting the width and the length into the perimeter formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (4 + (2 \times 4 - 1)) \]

Simplify inside the parentheses:

\[ P = 2 \times (4 + (8 - 1)) \]

\[ P = 2 \times (4 + 7) \]

\[ P = 2 \times 11 \]

\[ P = 22 \]

So, the perimeter of the flowerbed is 22 meters. Therefore, 22 meters of fence are needed to enclose the flowerbed.

To determine the length of the rectangular flowerbed, we start with the given width and calculate the length as stated: \( 4 \) meters. The length is described as being \( 1 \) meter less than twice its width. Hence, we can express the length as \( 2 \times 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \) meters. 

The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula \( P = 2 \times ( \text{length} + \text{width} ) \). Substituting the calculated length and width values, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (7 + 4) = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the total length of the fence needed to enclose the flowerbed is \( 22 \) meters.

To find out how many meters of fence are needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular flowerbed. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width). 

We know the width is 4 meters. Let's denote the length as L. According to the problem, the length is 1 meter less than twice the width, so we can write this as L = 2 * 4 - 1 = 7 meters.

Now, we can calculate the perimeter:
P = 2(L + width) = 2(7 + 4) = 2 * 11 = 22 meters.

Therefore, 22 meters of fence are needed.

From the problem, we know the width of the flowerbed is 4 meters. First, let's find the length of the flowerbed. The length is 1 meter less than twice its width. Therefore, we calculate the length as follows:

\[
\text{length} = 2 \times \text{width} - 1 = 2 \times 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \text{ meters}

\]

Therefore, the amount of fence needed is:

\[

To determine the total length of the fence required for the flowerbed, we first need to find the length of the flowerbed. The width of the flowerbed is given as 4 meters. The length of the flowerbed is described as 1 meter less than twice its width. Therefore, we can calculate the length as follows:

1. **Calculate twice the width:**
   \[
   2 \times \text{width} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Subtract 1 meter from the result to find the length:**
   \[
   \text{Length} = 8 - 1 = 7 \text{ meters}
   \]

So, the length of the flowerbed is 7 meters.

Next, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle to find out how many meters of fence are required. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})

To calculate the amount of fence needed, we first need to determine the dimensions of the flowerbed.

The width of the flowerbed is given as 4 meters.

The length is 1 meter less than twice the width. Twice the width is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) meters. So, 1 meter less than twice the width is \(8 - 1 = 7\) meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula: \(Perimeter = 2 \times (Length + Width)\).

Substituting the values we have:
\[Perimeter = 2 \times (7 + 4) = 2 \times 11 = 22\] meters.

To determine the total length of the fence needed for the rectangular flowerbed, we first need to calculate the length of the flowerbed. The width of the flowerbed is given as 4 meters. The length is described as being 1 meter less than twice the width. We can express the length mathematically as follows:

\[
\text{Length} = 2 \times \text{Width} - 1
\]

Substituting the width of 4 meters into the equation, we get:

\[
\text{Length} = 2 \times 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \text{ meters}

Now that we know the length is 7 meters and the width is 4 meters, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangular flowerbed. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
