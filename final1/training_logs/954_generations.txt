To find the percentage of snowballs that Janet made, we start by determining the total number of snowballs made by both Janet and her brother. Janet made 50 snowballs, and her brother made 150 snowballs. Adding these together, the total number of snowballs is \(50 + 150 = 200\). 

Next, we calculate the percentage that Janet's snowballs represent of the total snowballs. This is done by dividing the number of snowballs Janet made by the total number of snowballs, then multiplying by 100 to convert the fraction to a percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of Janet's snowballs} = \left(\frac{50}{200}\right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Janet made 50 snowballs out of a total of 50 + 150 = 200 snowballs. To find the percentage of snowballs Janet made, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Janet's snowballs}}{\text{Total snowballs}} \right) \times 100 \]
Substituting the numbers, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{50}{200} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]
Therefore, Janet made 25% of the snowballs.

To find the percentage of snowballs Janet made, we need to divide the number of snowballs she made by the total number of snowballs made by both Janet and her brother, and then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage.

Janet's snowballs: 50
Brother's snowballs: 150
Total snowballs: 50 (Janet) + 150 (Brother) = 200

Calculation:
(50 / 200) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, Janet made 25% of the snowballs.

To determine the percentage of the snowballs that Janet made, we need to use the formula for percentage which is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of snowballs Janet made}}{\text{Total number of snowballs}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{50}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Now we can simplify this expression:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \% \]

So, \(33.33\%\) of the snowballs were made by Janet.

First, you need to find the total number of snowballs made by both Janet and her brother. This can be done by adding their individual totals: 50 + 150 = 200 total snowballs.

Next, you need to find the percentage Janet made. To do this, you divide the number of snowballs she made (50) by the total number of snowballs made (200), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: \[ \frac{50}{200} \times 100 = 25\%\]

To find out what percentage of the snowballs Janet made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of snowballs made by both Janet and her brother combined.
2. Determine the proportion of the total that Janet's snowballs represent.
3. Convert that proportion to a percentage.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of snowballs.
Janet's brother made 150 snowballs. Since we don't have this number, let's assume the total number of snowballs is the sum of the numbers given or calculated from the context. For simplicity, let's assume the total number of snowballs is 200 (this is a common assumption for such problems).

So, the total number of snowballs is 200.

Step 2: Determine the proportion of the total that Janet's snowballs represent.
Janet made 50 snowballs, and the total number of snowballs is 200. The proportion is therefore 50/200.

Step 3: Convert that proportion to a percentage.
To convert the proportion to a percentage, we multiply by 100.
(50/200) * 100 = 25%

So, Janet made 25% of the snowballs.

To find out what percentage of the snowballs Janet made, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of snowballs:** 
   Janet made 50 snowballs and her brother made 150 snowballs. So, the total number of snowballs is:
   \[
   50 + 150 = 200
   \]

2. **Calculate the fraction of the total number of snowballs made by Janet:**
   Janet made 50 snowballs out of a total of 200 snowballs. The fraction of snowballs Janet made is:
   \[
   \frac{50}{200}
   \]

3. **Convert the fraction to a percentage:**
   To convert the fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   \frac{50}{200} \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

Therefore, Janet made 25 percent of the snowballs.

<reasoning>
To find out what percentage of the snowballs Janet made, we start by calculating the total number of snowballs made by both Janet and her brother. This is given by the sum of Janet's snowballs and her brother's snowballs: 50 snowballs + 150 snowballs = 200 snowballs.

Next, we find the fraction that represents the ratio of Janet's snowballs to the total snowballs: $\frac{50}{200} = \frac{1}{4}$.

To convert this fraction into a percentage, we multiply by 100: $\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%$.

Therefore, Janet made 25% of the snowballs.

To find out what percentage of the snowballs Janet made, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Janet's number of snowballs}}{\text{Total number of snowballs}} \right) \times 100 \]

Here, Janet made 50 snowballs and the total number of snowballs is the sum of Janet's and her brother's snowballs:

\[ \text{Total number of snowballs} = 50 + 150 = 200 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{50}{200} \right) \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus:

\[ 25\% \text{ of the snowballs were made by Janet} \]

To find out what percentage of the snowballs Janet made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of snowballs made by both Janet and her brother.
2. Determine the proportion of the total snowballs that Janet's count represents.
3. Convert this proportion into a percentage by multiplying by 100.

Let's proceed:

1. The total number of snowballs is the sum of Janet's and her brother's snowballs:
   Total = Janet's snowballs + Brother's snowballs
   Total = 50 + 150 = 200
   Total = 200

2. Janet's contribution as a proportion is:
   Proportion = Janet's snowballs / Total
              = 50 / 200

3. Convert the proportion into a percentage by multiplying by 100:
   Percentage = (Proportion × 100)
              = (50 / 200) × 100

   Simplify the division and multiplication:
   Percentage = (1 / 4) × 100
              = 25%

So, Janet made 25% of the total snowballs.
