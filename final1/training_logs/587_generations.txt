system
To calculate the total number of hours John worked from the 3rd to the 7th (inclusive of the 3rd but not including the 8th), we use the following calculation:

[ text{Total hours} = text{Hours per day} times (text{Last day} - text{First day} + 1) ]

Where,
- text{Hours per day} = 8
- text{First day} = 3
- text{Last day} = 7

Let's break this down:
1. The number of days worked is from day 3 to day 7, inclusive of day 3 but not day 8, so the number of days is ( 7 - 3 + 1 ).
2. Multiply the number of days by the number of hours worked per day to get the total hours worked.

Calculation:
[ text{Total hours} = 8 times (7 - 3 + 1) = 8 times 5 = 40 ]

Therefore, the total number of hours John worked is 40 hours.

The answer is 40 hours.

```python
def calculate_hours(first_day, last_day, hours_per_day):
    """
    This function calculates the total hours worked based on the first day, last day, and the number of hours worked per day.

    Returns:
    int: The total hours worked.
    """
    
    # Calculate the total hours worked
    total_hours = hours_per_day * (last_day - first_day + 1)
    
    return total_hours

John worked from the 3rd to the 7th (since he doesn't include the 8th), which gives us \(7 - 3 + 1 = 5\) days. Since he worked 8 hours a day, the total hours he worked is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) hours.

John worked from the 3rd to the 7th because he didn't work on the 8th. That's a total of 5 days. Each day he worked for 8 hours. So, the total hours worked is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

John worked from the 3rd to the 7th (inclusive), which means he worked for 5 days in total.

Each day he worked 8 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours he worked is:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

So, John worked 40 hours in total.

John worked from the 3rd to the 7th (since he did not work the 8th), inclusive. 

To find the total number of days he worked, we count as follows:
3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th.

There are 5 days in total, and he worked 8 hours each day.

So, the total hours worked is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

#### GENERATION 8 RESPONSE ####

system
To calculate the total number of hours John worked, we need to first determine how many days he worked.

From the 3rd to the 8th, which includes both the 3rd and the 8th, John worked for a period of 6 days (since the 8th is inclusive and the 3rd is not).

Each day, he worked for 8 hours. Therefore, for 6 days, the total number of hours he worked is:

\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Hours per day} \]

\[ \text{Total hours} = 6 \times 8 \]

\[ \text{Total hours} = 48 \]

So, John worked a total of 48 hours.

John worked from the 3rd to the 7th (inclusive of 3rd but exclusive of 8th) to calculate the number of hours he worked, we can use the formula for the total work hours:

\[ \text{Total Hours} = \text{Number of Days} \times \text{Hours per Day} \]

For the 3rd to 7th, John worked 4 days (3rd to 7th inclusive). So:

\[ \text{Total Hours} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the answer is 32 hours.

To determine the total number of hours John worked, we need to calculate the total number of days he worked and then multiply by the number of hours he worked each day.

John worked from the 3rd to the 7th. This means he worked on 7 - 3 + 1 = 5 days (we added 1 because we are counting both the start (3rd) and end (7th) days).

Since he worked 8 hours a day, the total hours worked are:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John worked 40 hours.

John's work dates were the 3rd and the 9th.  To find the length of work we subtract the first day from the last day and take the result from that minus 1.  9-3=6  6-1=5

So he worked 5 days.

He worked 8 hours a day, so he worked a total of $8\times 5 = \boxed{40}$ hours.

John worked from the 3rd to the 7th (since he does not include the 8th).

John worked from the 3rd to the 7th (inclusive of the 3rd but not the 8th). 

Number of days worked = 8 - 3 + 1 = 6 days.

Hourly work = 8 hours/day

Total hours worked = 6 days * 8 hours/day

<answer>
48
</answer>
<reasoning>
John's work days were from the 3rd to the 7th, inclusive of the 3rd but not the 8th. This means there are 6 days in total (since the 3rd and 7th are both works days, leaving a span of 4 days in between). He works 8 hours each day, so the total hours worked is \(6 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}\).
