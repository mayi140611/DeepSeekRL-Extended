system
The 4 pills that cost $1.50 each are a constant amount of money, so they cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.00
The other 5 pills cost $5.50 each more than the first 4 pills, this means they each cost $1.50 + $5.50 = $7.00
The others pills cost $7.00 each, if he took them for 14 days, the spent $7.00 * 5 = $35.00
He already spent $6.00 for the first 4 pills, so the total cost was $6.00 + $35.00 = $41.00

To calculate the total amount Henry spent on the pills, we need to calculate the cost of the pills he took each day and then multiply by the number of days he took them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 4 pills that each cost $1.50:
Total cost of 4 pills = 4 pills * $1.50/pill = $6

Next, let's calculate the cost of the remaining 5 pills:
The difference in cost between each of these 5 pills and the 4 that cost $1.50 is $5.50 more. Therefore, the cost of each of these 5 pills is:
Cost of each 5.50 more pill = $1.50 + $5.50 = $7.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of these 5 pills:
Total cost of 5 pills = 5 pills * $7.00/pill = $35

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for the 14 days:
Total cost for 14 days = Total cost per day * Number of days = (Cost of 4 pills + Cost of 5 pills) * 14
Total cost for 14 days = ($6 + $35) * 14 = $41 * 14 = $574

So, Harry spent $574 in total on the pills.

To find out how much Henry spent on the pills, we first need to determine the cost of the pills per day. We know that he takes 4 pills at $1.50 each, so the cost of these pills is:

\[ 4 \text{ pills/day} \times \$1.50/\text{pill} = \$6/\text{day} \]

The remaining pills cost $5.50 more per pack than the $1.50 pills. So, the cost of these pills per pack is:

\[ \$1.50 + \$5.50 = \$7.00/\text{pack} \]

Since Henry takes 5 pills a day, we need to determine how many packs he takes per day. We know that he takes 4 pills at $1.50 each and 1 pill at $7.00 each. Therefore, the number of packs he takes per day is:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ pills} + 1 \text{ pack} \cdot 5.50/\text{pill}}{7.00/\text{pack}} = \frac{4 + 5.5}{7} = \frac{9.5}{7} \approx 1.36 \]

Since he can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole pack. So, he buys 2 packs per day. The cost of these 2 packs per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs/day} \times \$7.00/\text{pack} = \$14.00/\text{day} \]

Now, we can calculate his daily cost:

\[ \$6/\text{day} + \$14.00/\text{day} = \$20.00/\text{day} \]

Finally, to find out how much he spends in total over 14 days, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days:

\[ \$20.00/\text{day} \times 14 \text{ days} = \$280.00 \]

Therefore, the answer is \$280.00.

To calculate the total amount Henry spent on pills, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pill and then add them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cheaper pills:
4 pills at $1.50 each: $1.50 * 4 = $6.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive pills:
There are 9 - 4 = 5 more expensive pills.
5 pills at $5.50 more than $1.50, meaning each costs $1.50 + $5.50 = $7.00
So, the total cost for the more expensive pills: $7.00 * 5 = $35.00

Now, let's add the cost of both types of pills to find the total amount spent:
$6.00 (cheaper pills) + $35.00 (more expensive pills) = $41.00

Therefore, Henry spent $41.00 in total on the pills.

Total number of pills taken by Henry = 9
Number of pills that cost $1.50 each = 4
Number of pills that cost $1.50 + 5.50 = 9 - 4 = 5
Cost of pills one each = 4 × 1.50 = $6
Cost of pills that cost more each = 5 × 6 + 5.50 = $31
Total cost = $6 + $31 = $37

First, we calculate the cost of the 4 pills that cost $1.50 each:
\[
4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find the cost of the remaining 5 pills, which each cost $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills:
\[
1.50 + 5.50 = 7.00 \text{ dollars each}
\]

Then, we calculate the cost of the remaining 5 pills:
\[
5 \times 7.00 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

We now sum the costs of all the pills:
\[
6 + 35 = 41 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Henry spent on the pills:
\[

Now, we calculate the total cost of the remaining 5 pills.

The pills cost $1.50 + $5.50 = $7 each. That means he spends a total of 9 - 4 = 5 pills at $7 each. That means he spends 5 x $7 = $35 on them. That means in 14 days he spends $35 x 14 = $490.

system
Each of the other pills cost $5.50 + $1.50 = $7.00
4 pills cost $7.00 each so $7 x 4 = $28.00
And the four pills cost $1.50 each so $1.50 x 4 = $6.00
Therefore, the 4 pills cost $28.00 + $6.00 = $34.00
Henry took 9 pills a day for 14 days, so he took 9 x 14 = 126 pills
The 9 pills that cost $1.50 each cost $1.50 x 9 = $13.50
So the total cost of the 9 pills is $13.50 + $34.00 = $47.50

The answer is 47.50.

To find out how much Henry spent on the pills, we need to calculate the cost of the 4 pills that cost $1.50 each and the cost of the remaining 5 pills that each cost $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 4 low-cost pills:
\[ \text{Cost of 4 low-cost pills} = 4 \times \$1.50 = \$6.00 \]

Next, since the high-cost pills each cost $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills, we calculate the cost of one high-cost pill:
\[ \text{Cost of one high-cost pill} = \$1.50 + \$5.50 = \$7.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 5 high-cost pills:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 high-cost pills} = 5 \times \$7.00 = \$35.00 \]

Finally, to find the total cost for all 9 pills, we add the cost of the low-cost pills and the cost of the high-cost pills:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$6.00 + \$35.00 = \$41.00 \]

Therefore, Henry spent a total of \$41.00 on the pills.

To calculate the total cost, we first need to determine the cost per pill for the other 5 pills.

4 pills cost $1.50 each, so the total cost for these is:
\[4 \text{ pills} \times $1.50 \text{ per pill} = $6.00\]

The other 5 pills cost $5.50 more each than the first 4 pills. Since the first 4 pills cost $1.50 each, the others cost:
\[ $1.50 \text{ per pill} + $5.50 = $7.00 \text{ per pill} \]

So, the total cost for the other 5 pills is:
\[5 \text{ pills} \times $7.00 \text{ per pill} = $35.00\]

Now we add the cost of the first 4 pills to the cost of the other 5 pills to find the total:
\[ $6.00 + $35.00 = $41.00\]

Therefore, Henry spent $41.00 in total on the pills.

To calculate the total cost of the pills, let's first find the cost of each type of pill. 

The total number of pills Henry took is \( 9 \times 14 = 126 \).

For the 4 pills that cost $1.50 each, the total cost is \( 4 \times 1.50 = $6. \) 

For the remaining \( 126 - 4 = 122 \) pills, each pill costs \( 1.50 + 5.50 = 7.00 \) dollars. So, the total cost for these pills is \( 122 \times 7.00 = $854 \).

Adding the cost of both types of pills, the total cost Henry spent is \( 6 + 854 = $860 \).
