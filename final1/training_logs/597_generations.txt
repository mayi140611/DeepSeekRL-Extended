From breakfast on Sunday to the end of the day on Thursday, there are 8 days. The minimum requirement is 2 cups of vegetables per day.

To meet the daily requirement for the week, Sarah needs to eat 2 cups * 7 days = 14 cups of vegetables.

Sarah has already eaten 8 cups.

To meet the daily requirement for the week, Sarah needs to eat 14 - 8 = 6 more cups.

Therefore, Sarah needs to eat 6 cups per day to meet her vegetable minimum requirement for the week.

Sarah has consumed 8 cups of vegetables from Sunday to Thursday, which is a total of 5 days. To meet the federal guideline of eating at least 2 cups of vegetables per day for the week, she needs to consume \(5 \times 2 = 10\) cups of vegetables in total for the week. Therefore, she needs to eat \(10 - 8 = 2\) cups of vegetables per day.

To find out how many cups of vegetables Sarah needs to eat per day to meet her daily minimum requirement for the week, we first need to find out how many total cups of vegetables she needs to eat each week based on the guidelines, and then how many cups she still needs to eat after breakfast on Sunday to Thursday.

The guideline is to eat at least 2 cups of vegetables per day, and she has from breakfast on Sunday to Thursday, which is 5 days. So, the total number of cups she needs in a week is:

\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ cups/week} \]

She has eaten 8 cups in the past 5 days, so the number of cups she still needs to eat to meet her weekly requirement is:

\[ 10 \text{ cups/week} - 8 \text{ cups} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups she needs to eat per day to meet her weekly requirement, we divide the total number of cups needed (10 cups/week) by the number of days (5 days):

\[ \frac{10 \text{ cups/week}}{5 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ cups/day} \]

Therefore, Sarah needs to eat 2 cups of vegetables per day from Friday to Tuesday.

Sarah has eaten 8 cups of vegetables from Sunday to Thursday, which is a total of 5 days. To meet her daily minimum requirement for the week of 2 cups, we need to calculate the remaining number of days she needs to eat vegetables in order to meet this requirement.

Total daily minimum requirement is 2 cups.
She has already eaten for 5 days, so she needs to meet her requirement for 7 - 5 = 2 more days.

Now, if she needs to meet her requirement for 2 more days, and she meets her daily requirement of 2 cups, she will need to eat:
2 cups/day x 2 days = 4 cups of vegetables in total.

Since Sarah has already eaten 8 cups to meet her daily minimum requirement for the week, she has already exceeded her goal. But if we're calculating how many cups per day she needs to eat to reach her weekly minimum of 2 cups per day, we can calculate it as:
8 cups / 2 days = 4 cups per day.

So, Sarah needs to eat 4 cups of vegetables per day, not exceeding her current daily intake to meet her weekly minimum requirement.

Sarah has eaten 8 cups of vegetables from Sunday to Thursday. There are 5 days in total (Sunday to Thursday). To find out how many cups she needs to eat per day to meet her daily minimum requirement for the week, we divide the total cups she has eaten by the number of days that week. So, 8 cups / 5 days = 1.6 cups per day.
Sarah needs to eat at least 1.6 cups of vegetables per day to meet her daily minimum requirement for the week.

To determine how many cups Sarah needs to eat per day from Friday to Sunday to meet her daily minimum requirement for the week, first, we understand that the minimum requirement of 2 cups per day over the four days from Friday to Sunday equals:

\[2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 8 \, \text{cups} \]

Sarah has already eaten 8 cups from Sunday to Thursday, which is more than the 8 cups required for the week. Therefore, she does not need to eat any more vegetables per day from Friday to Sunday to meet the daily minimum requirement.

system
To determine how many cups per day Sarah should eat to meet her weekly requirement, we start by calculating her total weekly requirement of vegetables.

The recommended daily intake of vegetables is 2 cups per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly intake should be:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ cups/week} \]

We know that from Sunday to Thursday, Sarah has already eaten 8 cups of vegetables. To find out how many more cups she needs to eat to meet her weekly requirement, we subtract the amount she has already eaten from the total weekly requirement:
\[ 14 \text{ cups/week} - 8 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups per day Sarah needs to eat to meet her weekly requirement, we divide the remaining cups she needs by the number of days left in the week:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ cups/day} \]

So, Sarah needs to eat 2 cups per day from Friday to Sunday to meet her weekly requirement.

To determine how many cups of vegetables Sarah needs to eat per day to meet her daily minimum requirement for the week, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she needs to eat in a week. According to the guidelines, she needs to eat at least 2 cups of vegetables per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of cups she needs to eat in a week is \(2 \text{ cups/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ cups}\).

Since we know she has already eaten 8 cups over the course of Sunday through Thursday, we need to find out how many more cups she needs to eat to reach her weekly minimum. The number of additional cups needed is \(14 \text{ cups} - 8 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups}\).

To find out how many cups per day she needs to eat to reach this total, we divide the number of cups needed (6 cups) by the number of days remaining (3 days), since Sunday to Thursday is already counted. Therefore, Sarah needs to eat \(6 \text{ cups} \div 3 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ cups/day}\).

The calculations show that Sarah needs to eat 2 cups of vegetables per day for the remaining days of the week to meet her daily minimum requirement.

Sarah has eaten 8 cups of vegetables from Sunday to Thursday. There are 5 days from Sunday to Thursday, so she needs to eat a total of 8 cups / 5 days = 1.6 cups per day.

Now, let's calculate the number of cups required to meet the daily minimum requirement of 2 cups per day for the week.

Total cups to eat in a week = 2 cups/day * 7 days = 14 cups.

We already know she ate 8 cups from Sunday to Thursday, so the remaining 14 - 8 = 6 cups are to be consumed from Friday to Sunday.

Since she needs to eat 1.6 cups per day from Sunday to Thursday and she still needs 6 cups to meet the minimum daily requirement for the week, she needs to eat an additional 6 cups / 2 = 3 more cups per day from Friday to Sunday.

Therefore, on Friday and Saturday, she needs to eat 1.6 + 3 = 4.6 cups per day.

Sarah has already eaten 8 cups from Sunday to Thursday, so she needs to eat the remaining:
\[ 10 \text{ cups} - 8 \text{ cups} = 2 \text{ cups} \]
Since she needs to eat the remaining 2 cups of vegetables from Friday to Sunday, we divide this by the number of days in the week (5) to find the daily minimum requirement:

To determine how many cups of vegetables Sarah needs to eat per day each day of the week to meet her daily minimum requirement, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from Sunday to Thursday:
   Sunday to Thursday is 5 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday).

2. Determine the total number of cups Sarah needs to eat in a week to meet the minimum requirement:
   The Federal guidelines recommend eating at least 2 cups per day. Therefore, for 5 days, the total requirement is:
   \[
   2 \text{ cups/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Determine how many cups Sarah has already eaten from Sunday to Thursday:
   Sarah has eaten 8 cups from Sunday to Thursday.

4. Calculate how many more cups Sarah needs to eat to meet her weekly requirement:
   \[
   10 \text{ cups} - 8 \text{ cups} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

5. Calculate how many cups per day Sarah needs to eat to meet her weekly requirement:
   Since she has 5 days left (Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday), we divide the remaining cups by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{5 \text{ days}} = 0.4 \text{ cups/day}
   \]

Therefore, Sarah needs to eat 0.4 cups of vegetables per day for the remaining days to meet her daily minimum requirement for the entire week.

Sarah has 7 days in total to meet her daily minimum requirement of 2 cups of vegetables per day. She has already eaten 8 cups in 6 days of the week, leaving 2 cups remaining for the week.

To understand how she needs to eat each day to meet the requirement, we need to find the average of the remaining 2 cups per day. 

For the 2 remaining days, we need to eat a total of 2 cups per day.

So, the daily minimum requirement is:

\( \frac{2 \text{ cups day}}{2 \text{ days}} = 1 \text{ cup per day} \)
