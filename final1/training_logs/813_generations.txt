<reasoning>
1. First, we calculate the total amount of coffee beans Maddie's mom uses per week. Since she makes 2 cups of coffee per day and a cup uses 1.5 ounces of coffee beans, we multiply these numbers together:
   \[
   2 \text{ cups/day} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces/cup} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ ounces/week}
   \]

2. Next, we determine how many bags of coffee she needs to buy to get 21 ounces. Since each bag contains 10.5 ounces, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{21 \text{ ounces}}{10.5 \text{ ounces/bag}} = 2 \text{ bags}
   \]

3. We then calculate the total cost of these 2 bags:
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times \$8/\text{bag} = \$16
   \]

4. Next, we calculate the amount of milk she uses per week. Since she uses 1/2 gallon of milk, we convert gallons to ounces:
   \[
   1 \text{ gallon} = 128 \text{ ounces}, \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{1}{2} \text{ gallon} = \frac{128 \text{ ounces}}{2} = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. We calculate the total cost of the milk:
   \[
   64 \text{ ounces} \times \$4/\text{gallon} = \$256
   \]

6. Finally, we calculate the total weekly cost by adding the cost of the coffee beans and the milk:
   \[
   \$16 + \$256 = \$272
   \]

Therefore, Maddie's mom spends \$272 on coffee per week.

To determine how much Maddie's mom spends on coffee each week, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee beans and the milk separately, and then add them together.

First, calculate the weekly coffee bean consumption:
- Maddie makes 2 cups of coffee per day.
- Each cup uses 1.5 ounces of coffee beans, so:
  \[
  2 \text{ cups/day} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces/cup} = 3 \text{ ounces/day}
  \]
- Converting days to weeks:
  \[
  3 \text{ ounces/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ ounces/week}
  \]
- Therefore, the weekly coffee bean consumption is 21 ounces.

Next, calculate the cost of the coffee beans:
- Coffee beans cost $8 per bag, and each bag contains 10.5 ounces.
- Number of bags needed:
  \[
  \frac{21 \text{ ounces}}{10.5 \text{ ounces/bag}} = 2 \text{ bags}
  \]
- Cost for 2 bags:
  \[
  2 \text{ bags} \times \$8/\text{bag} = \$16
  \]

Next, calculate the weekly milk consumption:
- Maddie uses 0.5 gallons of milk per week.

Now, calculate the cost of the milk:
- Milk costs $4 per gallon.
- Cost for 0.5 gallons:
  \[
  0.5 \text{ gallons} \times \$4/\text{gallon} = \$2
  \]

Finally, add the cost of coffee beans and milk to find the total weekly cost:
\[
\$16 + \$2 = \$18
\]

Therefore, Maddie's mom spends \( \$18 \) on coffee per week.

First, let's calculate the total amount of coffee beans Maddie uses in a week. Since she makes 2 cups of coffee per day and uses 1.5 ounces of coffee beans per cup, she uses \(2 \times 1.5 = 3\) ounces of coffee beans per day. Over 7 days, she uses \(3 \times 7 = 21\) ounces of coffee beans per week.

Since a bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces, the number of bags of coffee she needs for 21 ounces is \(21 / 10.5 = 2\) bags. The cost for these 2 bags is \(2 \times 8 = $16\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the milk. Since she uses 0.5 gallons of milk per week and a gallon costs $4, the cost for the milk is \(0.5 \times 4 = $2\).

Adding the cost of the coffee beans and the milk together, we get \(16 + 2 = $18\).

Therefore, Maddie's total weekly expenditure on coffee is $18.

To determine how much Maddie's mom spends on coffee per week, we need to calculate the costs for coffee beans and milk separately, and then sum them up.

First, calculate the weekly coffee bean consumption:
- Maddie uses 2 cups of coffee per day.
- She consumes 1 cup per day, so 2 cups per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so she uses \(2 \times 7 = 14\) cups per week.
- Each cup uses 1.5 ounces of coffee beans, so \(14 \times 1.5 = 21\) ounces of coffee beans per week.

Next, calculate the weekly milk usage:
- She uses 1/2 a gallon (0.5 gallons) per week.
- A gallon of milk costs $4, so 0.5 gallons cost \(0.5 \times 4 = $2\) per week.

Now, calculate the cost of coffee beans:
- A bag costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces.
- Since she uses 21 ounces per week, she needs to buy more than one bag in a week.
- So, she needs to buy 2 bags per week to cover the demand of 21 ounces.
- The total cost for coffee beans per week is \(2 \times 8 = $16\).

Finally, calculate the cost of milk:
- The cost of milk per week is given as $2 from the milk usage.

Adding the costs together:
- Cost of coffee beans: $16
- Cost of milk: $2
- Total weekly cost: \(16 + 2 = $18\)

Therefore, Maddie's mom spends $18 on coffee per week.

To calculate how much Maddie's mom spends on coffee per week, we need to consider the beans, milk, and any sugar that might be added.

1. **Coffee Beans:**
   - Maddie uses 2 cups of coffee per day, and each cup requires 1.5 ounces of coffee beans.
   - Therefore, the daily coffee bean requirement is \(2 \text{ cups/day} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces/cup} = 3 \text{ ounces/day}\).
   - To find the weekly requirement, we multiply this by 7 (days in a week): \(3 \text{ ounces/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ ounces/week}\).
   - So, 21 ounces of coffee beans are needed per week.

2. **Milk:**
   - Maddie uses 1/2 gallon of milk per week.
   - Since a gallon of milk costs $4, 1/2 gallon would cost \(1/2 \times 4 = 2 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Cost of Beans:**
   - A bag of coffee contains 10.5 ounces of beans.
   - Maddie uses 21 ounces per week, which is 2 times the 10.5 ounces in a bag.
   - Therefore, she would need two bags of coffee per week.
   - Each bag costs $8, so two bags would cost \(2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Total Cost:**
   - The total spent on coffee per week is the sum of the cost of beans and the cost of milk.
   - Cost of beans: $16
   - Cost of milk: $2
   - Total cost per week: \(16 + 2 = 18 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Maddie's mom spends $18 on coffee per week.

First, we need to determine the total amount of coffee beans Maddie's mom uses each week. Since she makes 2 cups of coffee per day, and each cup uses 1.5 ounces of coffee beans, the total amount of coffee beans used per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces/cup} = 21 \text{ ounces/week} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the coffee beans. Since each bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces, the cost per ounce of coffee beans is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ dollars}}{10.5 \text{ ounces}} \approx 0.7619 \text{ dollars/ounce} \]
Therefore, the cost of 21 ounces of coffee beans is:
\[ 21 \text{ ounces} \times 0.7619 \text{ dollars/ounce} \approx 15.96 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, she uses 0.5 gallons of milk per week, and since a gallon of milk costs $4, the cost of the milk is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the coffee beans and milk gives us the total weekly cost:
\[ 15.96 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 17.96 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddie’s mom spends approximately $17.96 on coffee per week.

To determine how much Maddie's mom spends on coffee per week, we need to calculate the weekly consumption of coffee beans and milk, and then find the cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the weekly coffee bean consumption.**
- Maddie makes 2 cups of coffee per day.
- Each cup uses 1.5 ounces of coffee beans.
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total coffee bean consumption per week is:
  \[
  2 \text{ cups/day} \times 1.5 \text{ ounces/cup} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ ounces/week}
  \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost of the coffee beans per week.**
- Each bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces.
- The number of bags needed per week is:
  \[
  \frac{21 \text{ ounces/week}}{10.5 \text{ ounces/bag}} = 2 \text{ bags/week}
  \]
- Therefore, the weekly cost of coffee beans is:
  \[
  2 \text{ bags/week} \times 8 \text{ dollars/bag} = 16 \text{ dollars/week}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly milk consumption.**
- Maddie uses 0.5 gallons of milk per week.

**Step 4: Determine the cost of the milk per week.**
- Each gallon of milk costs $4, so the weekly cost of milk is:
  \[
  0.5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 2 \text{ dollars/week}
  \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total weekly cost of coffee.**
- The total weekly cost is the sum of the cost of coffee beans and milk:
  \[
  16 \text{ dollars/week} + 2 \text{ dollars/week} = 18 \text{ dollars/week}
  \]

**Reasoning:**
- The calculations are based on the proportional usage of coffee beans and milk compared to the cost of the bags and gallons, respectively.
- Maddie's mom uses more coffee beans (21 ounces per week compared to 2 ounces per week) and more milk (0.5 gallons per week compared to 1 gallon per week) than what a single bag and gallon would provide, respectively.
