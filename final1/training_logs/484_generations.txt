To find out how much Lance makes on each workday, we first need to determine his total earnings per week and then divide that amount by the number of workdays.

1. Calculate Lance's weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Hours per week} \times \text{Hourly Wage} \]
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 35 \text{ hours} \times $9 \text{ per hour} = $315 \]

2. Divide the weekly earnings by the number of workdays to get the total earnings per day:
\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = \frac{\text{Weekly Earnings}}{\text{Number of Workdays}} \]
\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = $315 \div 5 = $63 \]

Now we know that Lance earns $63 each workday.

To determine how much Lance makes on each workday, we first need to find out how many hours he works each day. Since he works 35 hours a week and this is spread equally over 5 days, we can calculate the number of hours he works each day by dividing the total hours by the number of days:

\[ \text{Hours per day} = \frac{35 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} \]

Once we have the hours Lance works each day, we can calculate his earnings for each workday by multiplying the number of hours he works each day by his hourly wage.

\[ \text{Earnings per day} = \text{Hours per day} \times 9 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Now, let's do the calculations.
</reasoning>

<answer>
\[ \text{Hours per day} = \frac{35}{5} = 7 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Earnings per day} = 7 \times 9 = 63 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Lance makes $63 on each workday.

First, let's find out how many hours Lance works each day. Since he works 35 hours in a week and there are 5 workdays in a week:

\[35 \text{ hours} \div 5 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours per day}\]

Now, we can calculate how much Lance earns per day by multiplying the number of hours he works each day by his hourly wage:

\[7 \text{ hours} \times 9 \text{ dollars/hour} = 63 \text{ dollars per day}\]

So, Lance makes $63 on each workday.

To find out how much Lance makes on each workday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of hours Lance works per day:**
   Lance works 35 hours in a week and the work weeks are spread equally over 5 days. Therefore, the number of hours he works per day is:
   \[
   \frac{35 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 7 \text{ hours per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate Lance's earnings per day:**
   Lance earns $9 an hour. Thus, his earnings per day can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours he works per day by his hourly wage:
   \[
   7 \text{ hours per day} \times 9 \text{ dollars per hour} = 63 \text{ dollars per day}
   \]

3. **Summarize Lance's daily earnings:**
   Lance makes $63 on each workday.

To determine how much Lance makes on each workday, we'll first calculate his total earnings for the week and then divide that by the number of workdays he works each week.

Step 1: Calculate Lance's weekly earnings.
Since Lance works 35 hours a week and he earns $9 an hour, we multiply his hours worked by his hourly rate.
\[35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$9/\text{hour} = \$315/\text{week}\]

Step 2: Calculate Lance's earnings per workday.
He works 5 days a week, so we divide his total weekly earnings by 5.
\[\frac{\$315}{5 \text{ workdays}} = \$63/\text{workday}\]

Thus, Lance makes $63 on each workday.

To calculate how much Lance earns on each workday, we first need to determine the total number of hours he works in a week. He works 35 hours spread equally over 5 workdays.

Total hours in a week = 35 hours
Number of workdays = 5

Lance earns $9 an hour. To find out how much he earns on each workday, we divide his weekly earnings by the number of workdays.

Number of workdays in a week = 5
Hourly wage = $9

Earnings per workday = Hours per workday × Hourly wage
Each workday earnings can be calculated using the formula: \( \text{Earnings per workday} = \frac{\text{Total earnings per week}}{\text{Number of workdays}} \)

Let's calculate the total earnings per week.

Earnings per workday = \( \frac{35 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ workdays}} \times 9 \text{ dollars/hour} \)

Now perform the division:

\( \frac{35 \text{ hours}}{5} = 7 \text{ hours/workday} \)

Then multiply by hourly wage:

\( 7 \text{ hours/workday} \times 9 \text{ dollars/hour} = 63 \text{ dollars/workday} \)

So Lance earns $63 every workday.

To calculate how much Lance makes on each workday, we first need to determine his weekly earnings and then divide that by the number of workdays.

1. First, we find out how many hours Lance works in a day. Since he works 35 hours a week and spreads them equally over 5 workdays, we divide the total hours by the number of workdays:

   Total hours worked in a week = 35 hours
   Workdays = 5

   Hours worked per day = 35 hours / 5 = 7 hours

2. Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He earns $9 an hour, so:

   Weekly earnings = Hours worked per day * Hourly wage
   Weekly earnings = 7 hours * $9/hour = $63

3. Now we divide his weekly earnings by the number of workdays to find out how much he makes on each workday:

   Earnings per workday = Weekly earnings / Workdays
   Earnings per workday = $63 / 5 = $12.60

So Lance makes $12.60 on each workday.
