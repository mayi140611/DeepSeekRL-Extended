To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, we start by understanding the given ratio of oil to peanuts, which is 2 ounces of oil per 8 ounces of peanuts.

First, let's calculate the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[
\text{Total parts} = 2 \text{ (oil parts)} + 8 \text{ (peanuts parts)} = 10 \text{ parts}
\]

Next, we determine how many ounces of peanut butter corresponds to one part of the ratio. We know the total weight of the batch is 20 ounces. Therefore, we divide the total weight by the total number of parts:
\[
\text{Weight per part} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{10 \text{ parts}} = 2 \text{ ounces per part}
\]

Since each part represents 2 ounces, the amount of oil used in the batch is:
\[
\text{Amount of oil} = 2 \text{ parts} \times 2 \text{ ounces per part} = 4 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, Sonja used \(\boxed{4}\) ounces of oil in her last batch of peanut butter.

To find out how many ounces of oil Sonja used, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio of oil to peanuts she uses. The ratio given is 2 ounces of oil to 8 ounces of peanuts. 

First, let's denote the total weight of the peanut butter as \( W \) and the total weight of the oil as \( O \).

Given:
\[ W = 20 \text{ ounces} \]

From the ratio:
\[ \frac{O}{2} = \frac{20}{8} \]

Now, we solve for \( O \):
\[ O = 2 \cdot \frac{20}{8} \]
\[ O = \frac{2 \cdot 20}{8} \]
\[ O = \frac{40}{8} \]
\[ O = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Sonja used 5 ounces of oil in her last batch of peanut butter.

Let's denote the amount of peanuts used as \( P \) ounces and the amount of oil used as \( O \) ounces. According to the given ratio, the amount of oil used is two-thirds of the amount of peanuts used. So, we can write \( O = \frac{2}{3}P \).

The total weight of the peanut butter made is the sum of the weight of peanuts and the weight of oil, which is given as 20 ounces. So, we have:

\[ P + O = 20 \]

Substituting \( O \) with \( \frac{2}{3}P \) in the equation, we get:

\[ P + \frac{2}{3}P = 20 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ \frac{3}{3}P + \frac{2}{3}P = 20 \]
\[ \frac{5}{3}P = 20 \]

Multiplying both sides by 3 to isolate \( P \), we get:

\[ 5P = 60 \]

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

\[ P = 12 \]

Now that we know the amount of peanuts used, we can find the amount of oil used. Since \( O = \frac{2}{3}P \), we substitute \( P \) with 12:

\[ O = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

So, Sonja used 8 ounces of oil.

To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the ratio of oil to peanuts. According to the problem, the ratio is 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts.
2. Let \( x \) be the number of 8-ounce portions of peanut mixture in Sonja's last batch of 20-ounce peanut butter.
3. The weight of the peanut mixture is the number of portions times the weight of each portion, which is \( 8x \) ounces of peanut. The weight of the oil used is \( 2x \) ounces (since the oil quantity is twice the peanut quantity).
4. The total weight of the mixture is given as 20 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   8x + 2x = 20
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   10x = 20
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 2
   \]
7. The number of 8-ounce portions is 2, so the total weight of the oil used is:
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ ounces}

Let's denote the amount of oil used as \( O \) ounces, and the amount of peanuts used as \( P \) ounces. According to the ratio Sonja uses, for every 8 ounces of peanuts, she adds 2 ounces of oil.

We know the total weight of the peanut butter batch is 20 ounces. This includes the oil and the peanuts. So we have:

\[ O + P = 20 \] ounces

The ratio \( O:P \) is 2:8, which simplifies to 1:4. This means for every 5 ounces of the mixture (1 ounce of oil and 4 ounces of peanuts), 4 ounces are peanuts and 1 ounce is oil. 

Since the total weight (20 ounces) is split in this 1:4 ratio, 4 parts (which is 4 * 5 ounces) will be the oil and 1 part (which is 1 * 5 ounces) will be the peanuts.

To find out how much oil Sonja used, we multiply the total weight of oil parts by the amount of oil per part:

\[ O = 4 \times \text{oil per part} \]

Since the total weight of oil parts is 1 part (the oil portion):

\[ O = 4 \times 1 = 4 \] ounces

Let's break down the information given:

1. Sonja uses a ratio of two ounces of oil for every eight ounces of peanuts.
2. Her last batch of peanut butter weighed 20 ounces.

We need to determine how many ounces of oil she used.

Given the ratio of oil to peanuts is 2:8, we can simplify this to 1:4 (since 2/8 reduces to 1/4).

This means for every 4 parts of peanut butter, there is 1 part of oil.

Since her batch weighed 20 ounces, we can calculate the parts as follows:

20 ounces / 4 parts = 5 (ounces per part)

Now, since there is 1 part of oil for every 4 parts of peanut butter, the amount of oil in 5 parts is:

1 part * 5 parts = 5 ounces of oil

Therefore, Sonja used 5 ounces of oil in her last batch of peanut butter.

Let's denote the amount of oil used as \( O \) and the amount of peanuts used as \( P \). According to the given ratio, for every 8 ounces of peanuts, Sonja uses 2 ounces of oil. This can be expressed as:

\[ O = \frac{2}{8} P = \frac{1}{4} P \]

The total weight of her peanut butter is the sum of the weight of the oil and the weight of the peanuts. Therefore, we can write:

\[ O + P = 20 \]

Substituting \( O = \frac{1}{4} P \) into the equation, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{4} P + P = 20 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{4} P + \frac{4}{4} P = 20 \]
\[ \frac{5}{4} P = 20 \]

To solve for \( P \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{4}{5} \):

\[ P = 20 \times \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ P = 16 \]

Now that we know the amount of peanuts used is 16 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used by substituting \( P = 16 \) into the equation \( O = \frac{1}{4} P \):

\[ O = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, Sonja used 4 ounces of oil.

In Sonja's recipe, she uses 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts. Her last batch of peanut butter weighed 20 ounces, so we need to determine how much peanut mixture she used in that batch.

Let's find out how much mixture she used. Since she used a ratio of 2 ounces of oil to 8 ounces of peanuts in her recipe, we can establish that the total weight of the mixture used is based on the oil and peanuts combined.

For every 2 ounces of oil, she uses 8 ounces of peanuts to make the mixture. We need to determine how many such combinations fit into her 20-ounce batch:

\[
\text{Total mixture} = 2 \text{ (oil)} + 8 \text{ (peanuts)} = 10 \text{ units}
\]

Now, we know that each unit includes 2 ounces of oil. To find out how many units are in 20 ounces, we can set up the ratio:

\[
\text{Total units in 20 ounces} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{10 \text{ units}} = 2 \text{ units}
\]

So, 20 ounces of peanut butter corresponds to 2 units, with each unit consisting of 2 ounces of oil. Therefore, the total ounces of oil used is:

\[
\text{Total oil} = 2 \text{ units} \times 2 \text{ ounces per unit} = 4 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, Sonja used 4 ounces of oil in her last batch of peanut butter.

To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used, we first need to understand the ratio of oil to peanuts she uses. The ratio given is 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts. This means for every 10 ounces of the peanut butter mixture (which includes both oil and peanuts), 2 ounces are oil.

Given that her last batch of peanut butter weighed 20 ounces, we can calculate the amount of each component in the batch. Since the total weight of the mixture is 20 ounces, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio of oil to the total weight:

\[
\frac{\text{oil}}{\text{total weight}} = \frac{2}{10}
\]

Let \( x \) be the amount of oil used. Then the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{x}{20} = \frac{2}{10}
\]

Solving for \( x \) involves cross-multiplying:

\[
10x = 40
\]

\[
x = 4
\]

So, Sonja used 4 ounces of oil.

</answer>
<reasoning>
In Sonja's last batch of peanut butter, the total weight of the mixture is 20 ounces. According to the ratio given, the ratio of oil to the total weight is 2 ounces to 10 ounces. Therefore, the amount of oil used can be calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{\text{oil}}{\text{total weight}} = \frac{2}{10}
\]

Let \( x \) be the total weight of peanut butter. Then the equation is:

\[
\frac{x}{20} = \frac{2}{10}
\]

Solving for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 20:

\[
x = \frac{2}{10} \times 20
\]

\[
x = 4
\]

Thus, the total weight of the peanut butter is 40 ounces. Since the problem asks for the amount of oil used in the batch, and not just the total weight, the amount of oil used is half of this total weight:

\[
\text{Oil used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Thus, Sonja used 20 ounces of oil. However, this calculation was initially confused. The correct calculation is based on the correct interpretation of the ratio being per 8 ounces of peanuts, therefore the correct oil used is:

\[
\frac{2}{10} \times 4 = \frac{2\cdot4}{10} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \text{ ounces}
\]

So the correct amount of oil used is 4 ounces.

To solve this problem, let's break down Sonja's recipe and the relationship between the ingredients.

1. According to the problem, the ratio of oil to peanuts is 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts.
2. This means that for every 8 ounces of peanuts, 2 ounces of oil is needed to make peanut butter.

Now, let's determine how many 8-ounce portions are in the total weight of the batch of peanut butter, which weighs 20 ounces.

\[ \text{Number of 8-ounce portions} = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \]

Since we only use whole amounts of oil and peanuts, we need to consider the actual amounts used, not the number of portions. 

3. For each 8-ounce portion of peanut butter, Sonja uses 2 ounces of oil. Therefore, for each 8-ounce portion, she uses 2 ounces of oil.

4. For 2.5 such portions, we multiply the amount of oil needed per portion by the total number of portions:

\[ \text{Total ounces of oil used} = 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

So we can conclude that Sonja used 5 ounces of oil for her last batch of peanut butter.

To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, we need to use the given ratio of oil to peanuts. The ratio is 2 ounces of oil to 8 ounces of peanuts.

First, let's express the weight of the peanut butter in terms of the ratio:
- The ratio of oil to peanuts is 2:8.
- We can simplify this ratio to 1:4, meaning for every 4 ounces of peanuts, there is 1 ounce of oil.

Given that the total weight of the peanut butter is 20 ounces, we need to find out how many parts of the ratio correspond to the total weight. Since the ratio is 4 parts oil and 8 parts peanuts, the total parts of the ratio are 4 + 8 = 12 parts.

Now, we can calculate the weight of each part:
\[
\text{Weight of each part} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Total parts}} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{12} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ ounces per part}
\]

Next, we calculate the weight of the oil using the weight of one part:
\[
\text{Weight of oil} = \left(\frac{5}{3} \text{ ounces per part}\right) \times 1 \text{ part (oil)} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the number of ounces of oil Sonja used is \(\frac{5}{3}\) ounces. Since we typically express fractions in mixed number form, we can convert \(\frac{5}{3}\) to a mixed number:
\[
\frac{5}{3} = 1 \frac{2}{3} \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, the number of ounces of oil Sonja used is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{5}{3}}

2. **Understand the ratio of oil to total weight**: Sonja uses a ratio of 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts. This indicates a specific fraction of the total weight that oil represents.
  
3. **Calculate the fraction of total weight that oil occupies**: Since the ratio of 2 ounces of oil for 8 ounces of peanuts represents \(\frac{2}{8}\) of the total weight, we can simplify \(\frac{2}{8}\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

4. **Use the fraction to find the weight of oil in a batch of 20 ounces**:
   \[
   \text{Weight of oil in the batch} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Fraction of total weight occupied by oil}
