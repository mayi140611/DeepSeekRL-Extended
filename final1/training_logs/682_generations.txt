<reasoning>
To determine how much Jack and Jill each paid, we first need to find the total cost of renting the cottage for eight hours. Given that the cottage costs $5 per hour and they rented it for eight hours, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = Cost per hour * Hours rented
Total cost = $5/hour * 8 hours
Total cost = $40

Now that we know the total cost, we can divide this equally between Jack and Jill since they shared the cost:

Amount paid by each friend = Total cost / 2
Amount paid by each friend = $40 / 2
Amount paid by each friend = $20

So, each friend paid $20.

To find out how much each friend paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of renting the cottage for eight hours.

Total cost = Cost per hour × Number of hours
Total cost = $5 × 8
Total cost = $40

Now that we know the total cost, we can divide the total cost by 2, since Jack and Jill shared the cost.

Cost per person = Total cost ÷ 2
Cost per person = $40 ÷ 2
Cost per person = $20

Therefore, each friend paid $20.

To find out how much each friend paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of renting the cottage for eight hours. The cost per hour is given as $5, so for 8 hours, the total cost would be 8 * $5 = $40. Since the cost is shared equally between Jack and Jill, we divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each friend paid. So, $40 / 2 = $20 per person.

To find out how much each friend paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of renting the cottage. This can be done by multiplying the hourly cost by the number of hours they rented it for. 

The total cost is calculated as follows:
$5/hour × 8 hours = $40

Since the cost is shared equally between Jack and Jill, we divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each friend paid.

$40 ÷ 2 = $20

To determine how much each friend paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of renting the cottage for eight hours. The cost per hour is $5, so we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours they rented the cottage:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the total cost of renting the cottage is $40. Since Jack and Jill shared the cost equally, we divide the total cost by 2:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} \div 2 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each friend paid $20.

To determine how much each friend paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of renting the cottage for eight hours. Since the cottage costs $5 per hour, the total cost for 8 hours is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) dollars. Since Jack and Jill shared the cost equally, each friend paid half of the total cost. Therefore, each friend paid \(40 / 2 = 20\) dollars.

To find out how much each friend paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of renting the cottage for eight hours. The rental cost is $5 per hour, so for eight hours, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, since they shared the cost equally, we divide the total cost by 2:

\[ \text{Amount Each Paid} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Amount Each Paid} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{2} = 20 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, each friend paid 20 dollars.
