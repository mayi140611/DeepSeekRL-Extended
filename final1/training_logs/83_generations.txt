To find out how many hats each person gets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of red hats Zola has:**
   Paityn has 20 red hats. Zola has \( \frac{4}{5} \) times as many as Paityn.
   \[
   \text{Red hats Zola has} = \frac{4}{5} \times 20 = 16
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of blue hats Zola has:**
   Paityn has 24 blue hats. Zola has twice as many as Paityn.
   \[
   \text{Blue hats Zola has} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hats each has:**
   - Paityn's total:
     \[
     \text{Total hats Paityn has} = 20 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (blue)} = 44
     \]
   - Zola's total:
     \[
     \text{Total hats Zola has} = 16 \text{ (red)} + 48 \text{ (blue)} = 64
     \]

4. **Calculate the combined total number of hats:**
   \[
   \text{Combined total} = 44 + 64 = 108
   \]

5. **Calculate how many hats each gets if they share equally:**
   \[
   \text{Hats per person} = \frac{108}{2} = 54
   \]

Therefore, each person gets 54 hats.

To find out how many hats Paityn and Zola have combined, let's calculate the number of hats Zola has first:

Zola has \( \frac{4}{5} \) times as many red hats as Paityn. Since Paityn has 20 red hats, Zola has:
\[ \text{Zola's red hats} = \frac{4}{5} \times 20 = 16 \]

Zola also has twice the number of blue hats as Paityn. Since Paityn has 24 blue hats, Zola has:
\[ \text{Zola's blue hats} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Now, let's combine the hats:
\[ \text{Total hats} = \text{Paityn's hats} + \text{Zola's hats} = 20 + 16 + 24 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total hats} = 108 \]

Paityn and Zola have the total of 108 hats. Since they share the hats equally:
\[ \text{Hats per person} = \frac{\text{Total hats}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Hats per person} = \frac{108}{2} \]
\[ \text{Hats per person} = 54 \]

Therefore, each of them gets 54 hats.

The number of red hats Zola has is \(20 \times \frac{4}{5} = 16\). The number of blue hats Zola has is \(24 \times 2 = 48\). So they have \(20 + 16 = 36\) red hats in total and \(24 + 48 = 72\) blue hats in total for \(36 + 72 = 108\) hats in total.

If these are shared equally between Paityn and Zola which is a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\), they each get \(108 \div 3 = 36\) hats. 

Thus, Paityn and Zola will each end up owning 36 hats. 

So, the answer is 36 hats each.

To find out how many hats each person gets, we first need to determine how many hats Zola has.

Zola has \( \frac{4}{5} \) times as many red hats as Paityn, so:
\[ \text{Zola's red hats} = \frac{4}{5} \times 20 = 16 \]

Zola also has twice as many blue hats as Paityn, so:
\[ \text{Zola's blue hats} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Now, let's add the hats together to find the total:

Paityn's total hats: 20 red + 24 blue = 44 hats
Zola's total hats: 16 red + 48 blue = 64 hats

Combined total hats: 44 (Paityn) + 64 (Zola) = 108 hats

Finally, they share the hats equally between themselves, so each person gets:

\[ \text{Hats per person} = \frac{108}{2} = 54 \]

Therefore, each person will get 54 hats.

Let's calculate the number of hats Zola has:

- Zola has \( \frac{4}{5} \times 20 = 16 \) red hats.
- Zola has \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) blue hats.

Now, let's find the total number of hats they have together:

- Total red hats: \( 20 + 16 = 36 \)
- Total blue hats: \( 24 + 48 = 72 \)

Combine the hats:
Total hats = total red hats + total blue hats 
= \( 36 + 72 = 108 \)

Now, they share the hats equally:
Each gets \( \frac{108}{2} = 54 \)

Therefore, the answer is 54 hats each.

Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats. So, the total number of hats Paityn has is 20 + 24 = 44 hats.
Zola has 4/5 times as many red hats as Paityn, so she has 4/5 * 20 = 16 red hats.
Zola has twice the number of blue hats as Paityn, so she has 2 * 24 = 48 blue hats.
The total number of red hats Zola has is 16 + 0 = 16 (since she doesn't have any blue hats).
The total number of blue hats Zola has is 48 + 0 = 48.
Combining all the hats together, Paityn and Zola have 44 + 16 + 48 = 108 hats.
If they share them equally between themselves, each of them will get 108 / 2 = 54 hats.

To find out the number of hats Paityn and Zola have, we need to calculate the number of red and blue hats each has.

For Paityn:
- Red hats: 20
- Blue hats: 24

For Zola:
- Red hats: \(\frac{4}{5}\) of what Paityn has, which is \(\frac{4}{5} \times 20 = 16\)
- Blue hats: Twice what Paityn has, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\)

Now, let's add the total number of hats each has:
Total hats = Paityn's hats + Zola's hats
Total hats = (Red hats Paityn + Blue hats Paityn) + (Red hats Zola + Blue hats Zola)
Total hats = (20 + 24) + (16 + 48)
Total hats = 44 + 64
Total hats = 108

They are sharing the hats equally, so each will get:
Hats per person = \(\frac{Total hats}{2}\)
Hats per person = \(\frac{108}{2}\)
Hats per person = 54

The answer is 54.

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red hats Zola has by giving her 4/5 of Paityn's red hats.
2. Calculate the number of blue hats Zola has by doubling the number of Paityn's blue hats.
3. Combine the number of hats Paityn and Zola have.
4. Divide the total number of hats by 2 to determine how many each gains.

Let's start with calculating the number of red hats Zola has:

Zola's red hats = (4/5) * Paityn's red hats
Zola's red hats = (4/5) * 20
Zola's red hats = 16

Next, we calculate the number of blue hats:

Zola's blue hats = 2 * Paityn's blue hats
Zola's blue hats = 2 * 24
Zola's blue hats = 48

Now, we combine the total number of hats:

Total hats = Paityn's hats + Zola's hats
Total hats = 20 + 16 + 48
Total hats = 84

Finally, we divide the total number of hats by 2:

Each gets = Total hats / 2
Each gets = 84 / 2
Each gets = 42

Therefore, each of them gets 42 hats when they combine and share their hats equally.

To determine how many hats each person gets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of red hats Zola has:**
   Paityn has 20 red hats. Zola has \(\frac{4}{5}\) times as many red hats as Paityn.
   \[
   \text{Zola's red hats} = \frac{4}{5} \times 20 = \frac{4 \times 20}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of blue hats Zola has:**
   Paityn has 24 blue hats. Zola has twice the number of blue hats as Paityn.
   \[
   \text{Zola's blue hats} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hats each person has:**
   - Paityn's total hats:
     \[
     \text{Paityn's total hats} = 20 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (blue)} = 44
     \]
   - Zola's total hats:
     \[
     \text{Zola's total hats} = 16 \text{ (red)} + 48 \text{ (blue)} = 64
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of hats when combined:**
   \[
   \text{Total hats} = \text{Paityn's total hats} + \text{Zola's total hats} = 44 + 64 = 108
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of hats each gets when they share equally:**
   Since they share the hats equally, each person gets:
   \[
   \text{Hats per person} = \frac{\text{Total hats}}{2} = \frac{108}{2} = 54
   \]

Therefore, each person gets 54 hats.

Zola has \( \frac{4}{5} \) times as many red hats as Paityn has and twice the number of blue hats. So, the number of red hats Zola has is:

To determine the number of hats each person gets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red hats Zola has.
2. Calculate the number of blue hats Zola has.
3. Find the total number of hats Paityn and Zola have combined.
4. Divide the total number of hats by 2 to find out how many hats each person gets.

Let's start with the number of red hats Zola has. Zola has \(\frac{4}{5}\) times as many red hats as Paityn. Since Paityn has 20 red hats:

\[
\text{Number of red hats Zola has} = \frac{4}{5} \times 20 = \frac{4 \times 20}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16
\]

Next, we calculate the number of blue hats Zola has. Zola has twice the number of blue hats as Paityn. Since Paityn has 24 blue hats:

\[
\text{Number of blue hats Zola has} = 2 \times 24 = 48
\]

Now, we find the total number of hats Paityn and Zola have combined. First, we sum the red hats:

\[
\text{Total red hats} = 20 + 16 = 36
\]

Then, we sum the blue hats:

\[
\text{Total blue hats} = 24 + 48 = 72
\]

Adding the total number of red and blue hats together gives us the total number of hats:

\[
\text{Total hats} = 36 + 72 = 108
\]

Finally, we divide the total number of hats by 2 to find out how many hats each person gets:

\[
\text{Hats each gets} = \frac{108}{2} = 54
\]

So, each person gets 54 hats.
