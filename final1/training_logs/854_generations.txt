###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

It is recommended that men should consume no more than 150 calories of added sugar per day. Mark took a soft drink in the afternoon that contained 2500 calories, 5% of which was from added sugar. Then he bought some bars of candy which had 25 calories of added sugar each. If he eventually exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%, how many bars of candy did he take?

To determine how many bars of candy Mark consumed, we first need to calculate the amount of added sugar from the soft drink and the candy bars combined.

1. The soft drink contains 2500 calories, with 5% coming from added sugar:
\[ 2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \text{ calories of added sugar} \]

2. Let \( x \) be the number of candy bars he consumed.
Each candy bar has 25 calories of added sugar, so the total added sugar from the candy bars is:
\[ 25x \text{ calories of added sugar} \]

3. The total added sugar Mark consumed from the soft drink and the candy bars combined is:
\[ 125 + 25x \text{ calories of added sugar} \]

4. Mark is recommended to consume no more than 150 calories of added sugar per day. According to the problem, he exceeded the recommendation by 100%, which means he consumed 200% of the recommended amount:
\[ 150 \times 2 = 300 \text{ calories of added sugar} \]

5. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 125 + 25x = 300 \]

6. Solving for \( x \):
\[ 25x = 300 - 125 \]
\[ 25x = 175 \]
\[ x = \frac{175}{25} \]
\[ x = 7 \]

So, Mark took 7 bars of candy.

Mark's soft drink had 25% of its calories from added sugar, which is 2500 calories * 5% = 125 calories of added sugar.
To exceed the recommended intake by 100%, Mark needs to exceed the recommended intake by 150 * 2 = 300 calories.
Mark exceeded the recommended intake by 125 + 300 = 425 calories.
Mark took 425 / 25 = 17 bars of candy.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of added sugar Mark consumed and then figure out how many bars of candy he bought.

First, calculate the amount of added sugar in the soft drink:
\[ 2500 \text{ calories} \times 5\% = 2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \text{ calories of added sugar} \]

Next, calculate the total added sugar intake Mark took, excluding the candy:
\[ 150 \text{ calories per day} + 125 \text{ calories} = 275 \text{ calories} \]

Since the problem states Mark eventually exceeded the recommended intake by 100%, his total intake of added sugar was:
\[ 275 \text{ calories} \times 100\% = 275 \text{ calories} + 25 \text{ calories} = 300 \text{ calories} \]

Now, determine how much added sugar was in the candy:
\[ 300 \text{ calories} - 150 \text{ calories (recommended)} = 150 \text{ calories of candy} \]

Since each bar of candy contains 25 calories of added sugar, the number of candy bars Mark bought is:
\[ \frac{150}{25} = 6 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, Mark bought 6 bars of candy.

To find out how much added sugar Mark consumed, we first need to calculate the added sugar from the soft drink:

Soft drink calories with added sugar = 2500 * 5% = 125 calories

Next, we calculate how many calories Mark exceeded the recommended intake by:

Exceeded intake = Recommended intake + 100% of the recommended intake = 150 + 150 = 300 calories

Now, we subtract the calories from the soft drink from the exceeded intake to find out how many calories were from the candy:

Remaining calories from candy = Exceeded intake - Soft drink calories with added sugar = 300 - 125 = 175 calories

Each bar of candy contains 25 calories of added sugar, so the number of bars needed to consume 175 calories is:

Number of candy bars = Remaining calories from candy / Calories per bar of candy = 175 / 25 = 7

So, Mark bought 7 bars of candy.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the amount of added sugar in the soft drink: 
   - The soft drink contains 2500 calories.
   - 5% of these calories come from added sugar.
   - Therefore, the added sugar in the soft drink is \( 2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \) calories.

2. Determine how many bars of candy Mark consumed:
   - Mark exceeded the recommended added sugar intake by 100%, so he consumed 200% of the recommended amount.
   - The recommended intake per day is 150 calories.
   - Therefore, the total recommended intake for the day is \( 150 \times 2 = 300 \) calories.
   - To find out the extra amount of added sugar, we calculate \( 300 \times 2 = 600 \) calories.
   - Since each bar of candy contains 25 calories of added sugar, the number of bars required is \( \frac{600}{25} = 24 \).

3. Verify the consumption:
   - The soft drink contains 125 calories of added sugar.
   - The 24 bars of candy he consumed contain \( 24 \times 25 = 600 \) calories of added sugar.
   - Hence, the total added sugar intake is \( 125 + 600 = 725 \) calories per day.
   
Overall, the number of bars of candy Mark took is 24.

Mark's recommended daily intake of added sugar is 150 calories. He took a soft drink that contained 2500 calories, with 5% coming from added sugar. We'll first calculate how much added sugar is in the soft drink.

\[ \text{Added sugar in soft drink} = 2500 \times 5\% = 2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \text{ calories} \]

Now, he exceeded the recommended intake by 100%, meaning he consumed an additional 200 calories of added sugar over the recommended amount.

\[ \text{Total added sugar exceeding} = 125 + 200 = 325 \text{ calories} \]

Since each bar of candy contains 25 calories of added sugar, we can find out how many bars of candy he took by dividing the total added sugar exceeding by the calories per bar of candy.

\[ \text{Number of bars of candy} = \frac{325}{25} = 13 \]

So, Mark must have taken 13 bars of candy.

First, we need to calculate the amount of added sugar in the soft drink Mark consumed. The soft drink contained 2500 calories, with 5% coming from added sugar:
\[
2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \text{ calories} \text{ of added sugar}
\]
Next, let's determine the total amount of added sugar Mark consumed from the candy. We will denote the number of candy bars he bought as \(x\). Each candy bar contains 25 calories of added sugar, so the total added sugar from the candy is \(25x\) calories. The total added sugar Mark consumed is therefore:
\[
125 + 25x
\]
Mark exceeded the recommended intake of 150 calories by 100%, so he consumed:
\[
150 + 150 = 300 \text{ calories}
\]
Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[
125 + 25x = 300
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
25x = 300 - 125
\]
\[
25x = 175
\]
\[
x = \frac{175}{25} = 7
\]
Therefore, Mark bought 7 bars of candy.

First, we need to determine the amount of added sugar Mark consumed from the soft drink.

The soft drink contained 2500 calories in total, and 5% of this came from added sugar. So, the amount of added sugar from the soft drink is:
\[ 2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we know that Mark exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100% of the recommended daily limit. Since the recommended daily intake is 150 calories of added sugar, exceeding this by 100% means he consumed 200 calories of added sugar in total. Therefore, the additional calories from his candy bars must be:
\[ 200 - 125 = 75 \text{ calories} \]

Each bar of candy had 25 calories of added sugar, so the number of bars of candy he took is:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \text{ bars} \]

However, if he only ate 3 bars of candy, the total added sugar from candy bars would be:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ calories} \]

This exceeds the 200 calorie threshold by only 15 calories, which means he didn't exceed the recommended intake. Therefore, he must have eaten an additional bar of candy that didn't include added sugar from the bars.

Since each bar of candy has 25 calories, and we know he ate 3 bars, and another 15 calories exceeded the intake, he must have eaten 1 additional candy bar, which he didn't count in the 3 bars.

Thus, the total number of candy bars he took is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ bars} \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The soft drink contains 2500 calories, and 5% of it is from added sugar. Therefore, the amount of added sugar from the soft drink is:
   \[
   2500 \times \frac{5}{100} = 125 \text{ calories of added sugar}
   \]

2. Mark exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%. This means the total amount of added sugar he consumed exceeded 150 calories by 100%, or 200 calories. Let \( x \) be the total added sugar intake. Since he exceeded 150 calories by 200 calories, we have:
   \[
   x = 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ calories of added sugar}
   \]

3. We already know that from the soft drink, he ate 125 calories of added sugar. So, the remaining added sugar from the candy bars must be:
   \[
   350 - 125 = 225 \text{ calories of added sugar}
   \]

4. Each bar of candy contains 25 calories of added sugar. The number of bars of candy \( y \) he ate can be found by:
   \[
   25y = 225
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{225}{25} = 9

Let's break down the calories from added sugar in Mark's soft drink and candy.

1. Soft drink:
   - Total calories: 2500
   - Calories from added sugar: 5% of 2500 = 0.05 * 2500 = 125 calories

2. Candy bars:
   - Total calories: 100 / 110 (because he exceeded by 100%) * 150 (recommended limit) = 1363.64 calories (approx)
   - Calories from added sugar per bar: 25

3. Number of candy bars:
   - We know Mark exceeded the recommended intake by 150%.
   - 150% of 1363.64 calories = 1945.46 calories (approx)

Since each candy bar contains 25 calories from added sugar:
\[ \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{1945.46}{25} \approx 77.82 \]

Since he can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mark bought 78 candy bars.

However, this calculation seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the total calories and sugar consumption:

- Soft drink: 2500 calories, 125 calories from added sugar.
- Candy bars: 150 calories total from added sugar, with 25 calories per bar.

If the total calories were exactly 150% more than the recommended 150:

150 (recommended) + 150 * 1.10 = 360 calories
with 125 (soft drink) + x (candy bars) = 360 calories

So, solving for x,

\[ 125 + 25x = 360 \]
\[ 25x = 235 \]
\[ x = 9.4 \]

This indicates Mark exceeded the recommended intake slightly, rather than significantly more (like 100%). Therefore, if we slightly adjust for practical consumption:

If Mark was slightly over, let's round to the nearest whole number for practical consumption.

Therefore, he bought 78 bars of candy.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Added Sugar Content in the Soft Drink:**
   The soft drink contains 2500 calories, and 5% of these calories are from added sugar. Therefore, the amount of added sugar in the soft drink is:
   \[
   2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Added Sugar Content in the Candy:**
   Mark bought some bars of candy, each with 25 calories of added sugar. To find out how many bars he bought, we'll denote the number of bars as \( x \).

3. **Total Added Sugar Intake:**
   The total added sugar intake is the sum of the added sugar from the soft drink and the candy bars:
   \[
   125 + 25x
   \]

4. **Exceeding the Recommendation by 100%:**
   The recommended intake of added sugar per day is 150 calories. Exceeding this by 100% means consuming twice the recommended intake:
   \[
   2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ calories}
   \]
   Therefore, the total added sugar intake should be:
   \[
   150 + 300 = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]
   This is also equal to the sum of the added sugar from the soft drink and the candy:
   \[
   125 + 25x = 450
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   We solve the equation \( 125 + 25x = 450 \) for \( x \):
   \[
   25x = 450 - 125
   \]
   \[
   25x = 325
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{325}{25}

4. According to the recommendation, the total added sugar intake should not exceed 150 calories per day. Additionally, Mark exceeded this limit by 100%, meaning he consumed \( 150 + 150 = 300 \) calories of added sugar.

5. Set up the equation for the total added sugar intake exceeding the recommendation:
   \[
   125 + 25x = 300
