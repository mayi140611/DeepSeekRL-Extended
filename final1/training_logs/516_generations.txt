To calculate the total number of miles Roger rode his bike, you can add the distance he rode in the morning to the distance he rode in the evening.

Morning ride: 2 miles
Evening ride: 5 times the morning ride = 5 * 2 = 10 miles

Total ride = Morning ride + Evening ride = 2 + 10 = 12 miles

Roger rode his bike for 2 miles in the morning.
In the evening, he rode 5 times that amount, which is calculated as:
\[ 5 \times 2 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the morning and evening distances to find the total:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Roger rode his bike for 12 miles in total.

system
To determine the total miles Roger rode his bike, we start by calculating the distance he rode in the evening. Since he rode 5 times the morning distance, and he rode 2 miles in the morning, the evening distance is:

\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the morning distance to the evening distance to find the total miles ridden:

\[ 2 + 10 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total miles Roger rode his bike is 12 miles.
