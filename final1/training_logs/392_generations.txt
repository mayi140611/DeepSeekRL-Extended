###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Naomi is doing the wash. First she makes piles of different types, with one pile for towels, one for sheets, and one for clothes that need to be washed on the gentle cycle. The clothes take 30 minutes to wash. The towels take twice as long as the clothes to wash. The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels. How many minutes total will it take for Naomi to wash everything?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To find the total time it takes for Naomi to wash everything, we first need to calculate the time required for each type of load.

1. The clothes take 30 minutes to wash.
2. The towels take twice as long as the clothes, so the time for towels is 30 * 2 = 60 minutes.
3. The sheets take 15 minutes less than the towels, so the time for sheets is 60 - 15 = 45 minutes.

Now we add up the time for each type of load:
- Clothes: 30 minutes
- Towels: 60 minutes
- Sheets: 45 minutes

Total time = 30 + 60 + 45 = 135 minutes

Therefore, it will take Naomi 135 minutes to wash everything.

To find the total time it will take for Naomi to wash everything, we need to first determine the time it takes to wash the towels and sheets.

1. The time to wash the clothes is given as 30 minutes.
2. The towels take twice as long to wash as the clothes, so the time to wash the towels is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) minutes.
3. The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels, so the time to wash the sheets is \(60 - 15 = 45\) minutes.

Now, we add up the times for all the items:
- Clothes: 30 minutes
- Towels: 60 minutes
- Sheets: 45 minutes

Total time to wash everything is \(30 + 60 + 45 = 135\) minutes.

First, calculate the time it takes to wash the towels. Since the towels take twice as long as the clothes to wash, and the clothes take 30 minutes, the towels will take:

\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes to wash the sheets. Since the sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels, we can use the time it takes to wash the towels and subtract 15 minutes:

\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, to find the total time, add the time for clothes, towels, and sheets:

\[ 30 + 60 + 45 = 135 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Naomi 135 minutes to wash everything.

Let's calculate the time it takes for each type of laundry item to wash:

1. Clothes take 30 minutes.
2. Towels take twice as long as the clothes, so \(2 \times 30 = 60\) minutes.
3. Sheets take 15 minutes less than the towels, so \(60 - 15 = 45\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all items:
- Clothes: 30 minutes
- Towels: 60 minutes
- Sheets: 45 minutes

Total time:
\(30 + 60 + 45 = 135\) minutes.

So, it will take Naomi 135 minutes to wash everything.

Let's calculate the time step-by-step:

1. First, we know the clothes take 30 minutes to wash.

2. The towels take twice as long as the clothes, so:
   T = 2 * 30 = 60 minutes

3. The sheets take 15 minutes less than the towels, so:
   S = 60 - 15 = 45 minutes

4. Now, let's add up all the time:
   Clothes: 30 minutes
   Towels: 60 minutes
   Sheets: 45 minutes

   Total time = 30 + 60 + 45 = 135 minutes

It's important to add up all the time it takes for each type of laundry to wash. So, we first did the calculations: clothes took 30 minutes to wash, towels took twice as long, and sheets took 15 minutes less than towels.

Then, we added up the three times: 30 + 60 + 45 = 135.

To find the total time it takes for Naomi to wash everything, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of laundry and then sum them up.

1. The clothes take 30 minutes to wash.
2. The towels take twice as long as the clothes to wash, so the towels take \(2 \times 30 = 60\) minutes.
3. The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels, so the sheets take \(60 - 15 = 45\) minutes.

Now we can add up the time for each type of laundry:

\[
\text{Total time} = 30\ (\text{clothes}) + 60\ (\text{towels}) + 45\ (\text{sheets}) = 30 + 60 + 45 = 135\ \text{minutes}

First, determine the time to wash the towels. Since towels take twice as long as clothes to wash, we calculate:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes (clothes)} \times 2 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, find out how long it takes to wash the sheets. The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels, so:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes (towels)} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add the time it takes for each pile of laundry. The clothes take 30 minutes, the towels take 60 minutes, and the sheets take 45 minutes. Adding these times together gives:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} + 45 \text{ minutes} = 135 \text{ minutes} \]
