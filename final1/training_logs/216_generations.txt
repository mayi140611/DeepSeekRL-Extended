###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Missy had a giant piggy bank in her bedroom.  Every day she would search the house for change to put in her bank.  After 4 years, the bank was opened and it contained $450 in change.  If the second, third, and fourth-year she doubled the amount of money she put in the bank from the amount she had put in the previous year, how much money, in dollars, did she put in the bank the first year?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
The total amount of money in the piggy bank is $450.
The second, third, and fourth-year double the amount of money from the first year.
So, if we let $x$ be the amount of money in the bank the first year, then the second year would be $2x$, the third year would be $4x$, and the fourth year would be $8x$.
The total amount of money is $x + 2x + 4x + 8x = 15x$.
Since the total amount of money is $450$, we can set up the equation $15x = 450$.
Solving for $x$, we find $x = \boxed{30}$.
The answer is: 30

system
Let's denote the amount of money Missy put into the bank in the first year as \( x \). According to the problem, she doubled the amount every year. So, the second year she put in \( 2x \), the third year she put in \( 4x \), and the fourth year she put in \( 8x \). 

The total amount of money in the bank after 4 years is the sum of the amounts from each year:
\[ x + 2x + 4x + 8x = 15x. \]
We know this total is $450, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 15x = 450. \]
Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 15:
\[ x = \frac{450}{15} = 30. \]
So, Missy put $30 in the bank the first year.

system
The total amount of money put in the bank over 4 years is $450. The second, third, and fourth years she doubled the amount of money she put in the bank from the previous year. Let the amount put in the first year be X. Then, the second, third, and fourth year would be 2X, 4X, and 8X respectively. 
So, X + 2X + 4X + 8X = 450.
15X = 450.
X = 30. 
Therefore, Missy put $30 in the bank the first year.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the amount of money Missy put in the bank in the first year as \( x \).

According to the problem, each subsequent year, the amount of money she put in the bank is double the amount she put the previous year. So:

1. The second year, she put \( 2x \) dollars.
2. The third year, she put \( 2(2x) = 4x \) dollars.
3. The fourth year, she put \( 2(4x) = 8x \) dollars.

The total amount of money in the bank after 4 years is the sum of the amounts from each year, which is given as $450. So, we can write the equation:

\[
x + 2x + 4x + 8x = 450
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
15x = 450
\]

Dividing both sides by 15 gives us:

\[
x = \frac{450}{15} = 30
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Missy put in the bank the first year is \( 30 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Missy put in her piggy bank in the first year. According to the problem, the amounts she put in the second, third, and fourth years are double the amounts she put in the first and second, second and third, and third and fourth years, respectively.

The total amount of money in the bank over 4 years is given by:

The amount of money put in the bank over the years forms a geometric sequence where the second, third, and fourth-year amounts are double the first year's amount. Let \(a\) be the first year's amount in dollars, and \(r = 2\) be the common ratio.

The sum of the amounts in the first four years is given by:
\[ A(1 + r + r^2 + r^3) = 450 \]
Substituting \(r = 2\) into the equation, we get:
\[ A(1 + 2 + 4 + 8) = 450 \]
\[ A \cdot 15 = 450 \]
\[ A = \frac{450}{15} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, the amount of money Missy put in the bank the first year is \( \$30 \).

Let's denote the amount of money Missy put in the bank in the first year as \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, she doubles the amount of money each subsequent year. Therefore, the amounts put in the bank each year would be:
- First year: \( x \)
- Second year: \( 2x \)
- Third year: \( 4x \)
- Fourth year: \( 8x \)

The total amount of money in the bank after four years is given as $450. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 4x + 8x = 450 \]

Combining the terms on the left side gives:
\[ 15x = 450 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ x = \frac{450}{15} = 30 \]

Thus, the amount of money Missy put in the bank the first year is \(\boxed{30}\) dollars.

Let's denote the amount of money Missy put in the bank in the first year as \( x \) dollars.

In the second year, she doubled this amount, so she put in \( 2x \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total amount of money in the bank after 4 years is $450. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
