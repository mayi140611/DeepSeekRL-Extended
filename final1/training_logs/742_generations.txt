#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
Let's denote the shares of Sandra, Amy, and Ruth by \(2x\), \(x\), and \(3x\), respectively. According to the problem, Amy's share is $50, which corresponds to \(x\).

Therefore, we can form the equation:
\[
x = 50
\]

Since Sandra's share is \(2x\):
\[
\text{Sandra's share} = 2x = 2 \times 50 = \$100
\]

Thus, Sandra got $100.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Ratio Given**: The ratio of money shared among Sandra, Amy, and Ruth is 2:1:3.

2. **Amy's Share**: We know Amy received $50, which corresponds to the '1' in the ratio.

3. **Determine the Value of 1 Unit**: Since Amy's share of $50 corresponds to 1 unit (1 part of the ratio), we know that 1 unit equals $50.

4. **Calculate Sandra's Share**: Sandra's share corresponds to 2 units in the ratio. 
   \[
   \text{Sandra's share} = 2 \times 50 = 100
   \]

Thus, Sandra received $100.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total ratio and then use the ratio to find out how much Sandra received.

First, let's find the total ratio: 2 (Sandra) + 1 (Amy) + 3 (Ruth) = 6.

Next, we need to find how much the ratio represents for Amy's share. Since Amy's share is related to the total amount of money, we can use the following proportion to find the value each part of the ratio represents:

\[ \frac{Amy's\ Share}{Total\ Ratio} = \frac{50}{Total\ Ratio} \]

\[ \frac{50}{6} = \frac{Total\ Ratio}{Total\ Ratio} \]

\[ 50 = 2 \times Amy's\ Share \]

Therefore, Sandra's share is double Amy's share because Sandra's ratio is 2.

\[ Sandra's\ Share = 2 \times Amy's\ Share \]

\[ Sandra's\ Share = 2 \times 50 \]

\[ Sandra's\ Share = $100 \]

Let's denote the total amount of money shared by \( T \). The total ratio of the amount of money shared among Sandra, Amy, and Ruth is \( 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 \).

Given that the ratio of Amy's share to Sandra's share is 1:2, we can denote Amy's part of the ratio as \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the total, and Sandra's part of the ratio as \( \frac{2}{6} \) of the total. 

Since Amy got $50, which corresponds to \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the total amount, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{1}{6}T = 50 \]

Solving for \( T \), we get:
\[ T = 50 \times 6 = 300 \]

Now, we know the total amount of money is $300. Sandra's share is \( \frac{2}{6} \) of the total, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{6} \times 300 = 100 \]

So, Sandra got $100.

To determine how much Sandra received, we first need to understand the ratio and the total parts represented by Amy's share. The ratio is 2:1:3, meaning for every 6 parts (2+1+3) of money, Amy gets 1 part, and Ruth gets 3 parts.

Amy's share is $50, which corresponds to 1 part of the total. To find the value of 1 part, we divide Amy's share by the number of parts Amy represents:
\[ 1 \text{ part} = \frac{50}{1} = 50 \]

Since Sandra's share corresponds to 2 parts in the ratio, we calculate Sandra's share by multiplying the value of 1 part by 2:
\[ \text{Sandra's share} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, Sandra received $100.

Let's denote the total sum of money shared as \( T \).

According to the ratio \( 2:1:3 \), the shares of Sandra, Amy, and Ruth can be expressed as \( 2x \), \( x \), and \( 3x \) respectively, where \( x \) is a common multiplier.

We are given that Amy got $50, which corresponds to the share \( x \). Therefore, we have:
\[ x = 50 \]

Now, to find Sandra's share, which is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x \) with $50:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = \$100 \]

Thus, Sandra got $100.

To find out how much Sandra received, we first need to understand the ratio in which the money was shared between Tamika, Janice and Charlene, which is 2:1:3. This means for every 6 parts of the money, Tamika gets 2 parts, Janice gets 1 part, and Charlene gets 3 parts.

We know that Janice (Amy) got $50, which corresponds to 1 part of the ratio. Therefore, each part is worth $50. Now, to find out how much Sandra (2 parts) received, we need to calculate \(2 \times 50\).

Thus, Sandra received \(2 \times 50 = \$100\).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The money was shared in the ratio 2:1:3, which means for every 6 parts of the total money, Sandra gets 2 parts, Amy gets 1 part, and Ruth gets 3 parts.
2. According to the problem, Amy got $50, and since her share corresponds to 1 part in the ratio, we can determine the value of one part.
3. If $50 is 1 part, then 6 parts (which is the total) would be $50 * 6 = $300 in total.
4. Sandra's share corresponds to 2 parts out of the 6 parts in the ratio. Therefore, Sandra's share would be 2 * $300 = $600.

To determine how much Sandra received, we need to understand the given ratio and the amount Amy received. The ratio between Sandra, Amy, and Ruth is 2:1:3. This means for every $1 Amy received, Sandra received $2 and Ruth received $3. 

Since Amy received $50, we can calculate the common factor in the ratio. The amount Amy received corresponds to a '1' in the ratio, so we divide $50 by 1 to find the value of 1 in the ratio:
\[ 1_{ratio} = \$50 \]

Using this, we can find the amounts Sandra and Ruth received. Sandra's share (2 ratios) is:
\[ 2_{ratio} = 2 \times 50 = \$100 \]
Ruth's share (3 ratios) is:
\[ 3_{ratio} = 3 \times 50 = \$150 \]

Now, to find out how much Sandra received, we use the fact that her share is 2 ratios and divide by the total of all 6 ratios:
\[ \text{Sandra's share} = \frac{2}{6} \times 50 \]

Calculating this gives:
\[ \frac{2}{6} \times 50 = \frac{1}{3} \times 50 = \$16.67 \]

Therefore, Sandra received approximately $16.67.

Let's denote the total sum of money shared by Sam as \( T \). According to the ratio 2:1:3, we can express the shares of Sandra, Amy, and Ruth as:
\[ \text{Sandra's share} = 2x \]
\[ \text{Amy's share} = x \]
\[ \text{Ruth's share} = 3x \]

We know that Amy's share is $50, so:
\[ x = 50 \]

Now, using the total ratio, the sum of all the parts of the ratio is:
\[ 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 \]

Since each part represents:
\[ \frac{\text{Amy's share}}{x} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \]

Therefore, each part of the ratio is worth $1. Hence, we can calculate Sandra's share as:
\[ \text{Sandra's share} = 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, Sandra got $100.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the ratio of the shares between Sandra, Amy, and Ruth, which is given as 2:1:3. This means Sandra's share is twice Amy's share, and Ruth's share is three times Amy's share.

Given that Amy got $50, we can calculate Sandra's share by doubling Amy's share, because Sandra's share is twice Amy's share. 

Sandra's share = 2 * Amy's share = 2 * $50 = $100.

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the ratio 2:1:3 means that for every 6 parts of money shared, 2 parts go to Sandra, 1 part goes to Amy, and 3 parts go to Ruth.

Given that Amy got $50, which corresponds to 1 part of the ratio, we can determine the size of each part. Since 1 part equals $50, every 6 parts would equal $50 * 6 = $300. 

Therefore, Sandra got 2 parts out of these 6 parts, so Sandra received $300 * 2 = $600.

Let's denote the total amount of money shared by \( T \).

Given that Amy received $50, and her share corresponds to the ratio 1, we can write:
\[ \text{Amy's share} = 50 = \frac{1}{1+2+3} \times T \]
\[ 50 = \frac{1}{6} \times T \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides by 6:
\[ T = 50 \times 6 = 300 \]

Now, we need to find Sandra's share, which corresponds to the ratio 2:
\[ \text{Sandra's share} = 2 \times \frac{300}{6} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, Sandra received $100.

To determine how much Sandra received, we start by understanding the given ratio and the amount Amy received. The ratio of the money shared between Sandra, Amy, and Ruth is 2:1:3. This means that for every share Amy gets, Sandra gets two shares, and Ruth gets three shares.

We know that Amy received $50. Since the ratio for Amy is 1 part, we can calculate the value of each part in the ratio. Let's denote the value of each part as \( x \). Therefore, Amy's share corresponds to 1 part, so \( x = 50 \).

Sandra's share corresponds to 2 parts. Therefore, Sandra's share can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Sandra's share} = 2 \times x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, Sandra received $100.
