<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of frogs in Lake Crystal as \( L_c \).

According to the given information, Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake. This means that Lake Crystal has 80% of the number of frogs in Lassie Lake.

Given that Lassie Lake has 45 frogs, Lake Crystal has:
\[ L_c = 45 - (0.2 \times 45) = 45 - (9) = 36 \]

The total number of frogs in both lakes is:
\[ L_c + \text{Lassie Lake} = 36 + 45 = 81 \]

So the total number of frogs in both lakes is 81.

Let's denote the number of frogs in Lake Crystal as \( C \). According to the given information, Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake. Since Lassie Lake has forty-five frogs, the number of frogs in Lake Crystal is 80% of forty-five frogs. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C = 45 - 0.2 \times 45 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ C = 45 - 9 \]
\[ C = 36 \]

So, there are 36 frogs in Lake Crystal. Now, to find the total number of frogs in both lakes, we add the number of frogs in Lassie Lake and Lake Crystal:
\[ \text{Total} = 45 + 36 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 81 \]

Therefore, there are 81 frogs in total in the two lakes.

To find the number of frogs in Lake Crystal, we first need to calculate how many frogs it has based on Lassie Lake's number of frogs. Since Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake, we can calculate the number of frogs in Lake Crystal by taking the number of frogs in Lassie Lake and subtracting twenty percent of that number.

The calculation would be:
\[ \text{Frogs in Lake Crystal} = \text{Frogs in Lassie Lake} - 20\% \times \text{Frogs in Lassie Lake} \]
\[ \text{Frogs in Lake Crystal} = 45 - (0.20 \times 45) \]
\[ \text{Frogs in Lake Crystal} = 45 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Frogs in Lake Crystal} = 36 \]

Now that we know the number of frogs in each lake, we can find the total number of frogs by adding the number of frogs in Lake Crystal to the number in Lassie Lake:
\[ \text{Total number of frogs} = \text{Frogs in Lake Crystal} + \text{Frogs in Lassie Lake} \]
\[ \text{Total number of frogs} = 36 + 45 \]
\[ \text{Total number of frogs} = 81 \]

Therefore, there are 81 frogs in total in the two lakes.

Let's start by determining the number of frogs in Lake Crystal. According to the problem, Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake. Lassie Lake has forty-five frogs. Twenty percent of forty-five frogs is calculated as follows:

\[ 20\% \times 45 = \frac{20}{100} \times 45 = 0.2 \times 45 = 9 \]

Since Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs, we subtract this number from the total frogs in Lassie Lake:

\[ 45 - 9 = 36 \]

So, Lake Crystal has 36 frogs.

Now, to find the total number of frogs in both lakes, we add the number of frogs in Lassie Lake to the number of frogs in Lake Crystal:

\[ 45 + 36 = 81 \]

Therefore, the total number of frogs in the two lakes is 81.

To find the total number of frogs in both lakes, we first need to determine how many frogs are in Lake Crystal. Since Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake, we can calculate this as follows:

1. Calculate twenty percent of Lassie Lake's number of frogs:
\[ 20\% \times 45 = 0.20 \times 45 = 9 \]

2. Subtract this number from Lassie Lake's total to find the number of frogs in Lake Crystal:
\[ 45 - 9 = 36 \]

3. Now, add the number of frogs in both lakes to get the total:
\[ 36 + 45 = 81 \]

So, the total number of frogs in both lakes is 81.

Let's denote the number of frogs in Lassie Lake as \( L \) and the number of frogs in Lake Crystal as \( C \).

According to the information given:
\[ L = 45 \] (frogs in Lassie Lake)

Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake, which can be mathematically represented as:
\[ C = L - 0.2 \times L \]
\[ C = L \times (1 - 0.2) \]
\[ C = L \times 0.8 \]

Substitute \( L = 45 \) into the equation to find \( C \):
\[ C = 45 \times 0.8 \]
\[ C = 36 \]

So, there are 36 frogs in Lake Crystal.

Now, to find the total number of frogs in both lakes:
\[ \text{Total frogs} = L + C \]
\[ \text{Total frogs} = 45 + 36 \]
\[ \text{Total frogs} = 81 \]

Therefore, there are 81 frogs in total in the two lakes.

Let's calculate the number of frogs in Lake Crystal. Since Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake, which has forty-five frogs, we first need to determine what twenty percent of forty-five is, and then subtract that amount from forty-five to find out how many frogs are in Lake Crystal.

20% of 45 frogs = 0.20 * 45 = 9 frogs

Lake Crystal has 45 - 9 = 36 frogs

Now that we know the number of frogs in both lakes, we can add them together to find the total number of frogs in the two lakes:

Lake Crystal: 36 frogs
Lassie Lake: 45 frogs

Total frogs in both lakes = 36 + 45 = 81 frogs

Therefore, there are 81 frogs in total in the two lakes.

Let's denote the number of frogs in Lake Crystal as \( C \). According to the problem, Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake. If Lassie Lake has forty-five frogs, then Lake Crystal has \( 80\% \) of the number of frogs in Lassie Lake. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ C = 45 - 0.2 \times 45 \]

First, let's calculate how many frogs are in Lake Crystal:
\[ C = 45 - 0.2 \times 45 = 45 - 9 = 36 \]

Now, we have \( C = 36 \) frogs in Lake Crystal and Lassie Lake has 45 frogs. To find the total number of frogs in both lakes, we simply add the number of frogs in each lake:
\[ \text{Total frogs} = 36 + 45 = 81 \]

Therefore, the total number of frogs in the two lakes is 81.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many frogs Lake Crystal has. Since Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake, we can calculate the number of frogs in Lake Crystal by subtracting twenty percent of Lassie Lake's frog population from Lassie Lake's total. 

Lassie Lake has forty-five frogs.
Twenty percent of forty-five is calculated as: 
\(20\% \times 45 = 0.20 \times 45 = 9\) frogs.

Now, to find the number of frogs in Lake Crystal, we subtract this number from the total at Lassie Lake:
\(45 - 9 = 36\) frogs.

Therefore, Lake Crystal has 36 frogs.

Next, we need to find the total number of frogs in both lakes. To do this, we simply add the number of frogs in each lake:
\(45 + 36 = 81\).

Thus, the total number of frogs in the two lakes is \(81\).

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of frogs in Lake Crystal. Since Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake, we calculate the number of frogs in Lake Crystal as follows:

Number of frogs in Lake Crystal = Number of frogs in Lassie Lake - (20% of Number of frogs in Lassie Lake)

Number of frogs in Lake Crystal = 45 frogs (Lassie Lake) - (20/100 * 45) frogs
Number of frogs in Lake Crystal = 45 frogs - 9 frogs
Number of frogs in Lake Crystal = 36 frogs

Now that we have the number of frogs in both lakes, we can find the total number of frogs in both lakes by adding the number of frogs in Lassie Lake and the number of frogs in Lake Crystal:

Total number of frogs in both lakes = Number of frogs in Lassie Lake + Number of frogs in Lake Crystal
Total number of frogs in both lakes = 45 frogs + 36 frogs
Total number of frogs in both lakes = 81 frogs

Therefore, the total number of frogs in the two lakes is 81 frogs.

Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake. To find the number of frogs in Lake Crystal:
\[ \text{Number of frogs in Lake Crystal} = \text{Number of frogs in Lassie Lake} - \left( \frac{20}{100} \times \text{Number of frogs in Lassie Lake} \right) \]

Since Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake, we can calculate the number of frogs in Lake Crystal by subtracting twenty percent of the number of frogs in Lassie Lake from the total.

The number of frogs in Lassie Lake is given as 45. So, we calculate 20% of 45:
