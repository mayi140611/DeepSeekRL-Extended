To determine the total length of Tony's rope, we need to calculate the total length of the ropes before tying them together and then subtract the length lost due to knots.

First, let's add up the lengths of all the ropes:
- 8 feet
- 20 feet
- 3 ropes, each 2 feet = 3 * 2 = 6 feet
- 7 feet
Total length of ropes = 8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41 feet

Next, we calculate the length lost due to knots. Tony ties the ropes together, making a total of 4 knots (since he has 3 ropes):
- 1.2 feet per knot * 4 knots = 4.8 feet

Now, subtract the length lost due to knots from the total length of the ropes:
- Total length after tying = 41 feet - 4.8 feet = 36.2 feet

Therefore, the total length of Tony's rope when he's done tying all of them together is 36.2 feet.

First, we need to calculate the total length of rope Tony has initially:

- 8 feet from the first rope
- 20 feet from the second rope
- 3 * 2 feet from the third ropes (6 feet total)
- 7 feet from the fourth rope

Adding these together gives us the initial total length before tying any knots:

8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41 feet

Next, we need to calculate how much rope Tony loses due to knots. He ties 4 knots in total (since he has 5 ropes), and each knot causes him to lose 1.2 feet:

4 knots * 1.2 feet/knot = 4.8 feet lost

Now, we subtract the 4.8 feet lost due to knots from the initial total length:

41 feet - 4.8 feet = 36.2 feet

So, the final length of the rope, after tying all the knots, is 36.2 feet.

To find the total length of rope Tony has, we first need to calculate the total length of all the individual pieces of rope. The 8-foot rope, the 20-foot rope, and the three 2-foot ropes have a combined length of 8 + 20 + 3*2 = 34 feet. The 7-foot rope is added to the total length of 34 feet. Therefore, the total length of rope is 34 + 7 = 41 feet.

Tony needs to tie knots to connect the pieces of rope, and each knot reduces the total length of the rope by 1.2 feet. Since the number of knots required to connect each piece to the rest is equal to the number of pieces connecting it, the total loss due to knots will be a multiple of 1.2 feet. The three 2-foot ropes, which are connected to the 8-foot and 20-foot ropes, require 3 knots, and the 7-foot rope requires 1 knot. Therefore, the total reduction in the total length of the rope is 3*1.2 + 1*1.2 = 4.4 feet. 

Subtracting the total loss due to knots from the total length of rope gives us 41 - 4.4 = 36.6 feet.

First, we need to calculate the total length of the rope Tony has collected initially:
\[8 + 20 + 3 \times 2 + 7\]
\[= 8 + 20 + 6 + 7\]
\[= 41 \text{ feet}\]

Tony has a total of 7 knots to tie his ropes together. Since each knot results in a loss of 1.2 feet:
\[1.2 \times 7 = 8.4 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length after accounting for the knots is:
\[41 - 8.4 = 32.6 \text{ feet}\]

To determine the total length of the rope when all the pieces are tied together, we first need to calculate the total length of the pieces before accounting for the knots.

The total length of the pieces of rope before knots is the sum of the lengths of all the pieces:

\[8 + 20 + 3 \times 2 + 7 = 8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41 \text{ feet}\]

Now, we need to calculate the total length lost due to the knots. Since he makes 1.2 feet lost per knot and he has 3 knots (from the 3 2-foot ropes), the total lost length is:

\[3 \times 1.2 = 3.6 \text{ feet}\]

To find the final length of the rope, we subtract the total lost length from the total length before knots:

\[41 - 3.6 = 37.4 \text{ feet}\]

Thus, the length of the rope when all parts are tied together is 37.4 feet.

First, we need to calculate the total length of the ropes Tony has initially. The 8-foot rope, the 20-foot rope, the three 2-foot ropes, and the 7-foot rope should be added together: \(8 + 20 + 2 \times 3 + 7 = 8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41\) feet.

Next, we need to account for the weight loss. Each knot makes him lose 1.2 feet per knot. Tony is tying all the ropes together, so he will have to make a total of \(8 + 20 + 3 + 2 = 33\) knots. Thus, the weight loss will be \(33 \times 1.2 = 39.6\) feet.

To get the final length of the rope, we subtract the weight loss from the initial total length: \(41 - 39.6 = 1.4\) feet.

Tony has three 2-foot ropes, which total 6 feet (2*3). Adding this to the 8-foot rope he finds, this is 14 feet. He also has three 2-foot ropes, which total 6 feet.
Now, 7 feet was added to the total length.
Next the 7-foot rope is added, bringing the total to 21 feet.
Each knot he ties makes him loose 1. 2 feet per knot.
So there are 6 knots, making a loss of 7. 2 feet (1.2*6).

Thus his final rope total is 13. 8 feet.

- 7-foot rope

Total length of all the ropes without any knots:

Now, let's calculate the total length lost due to knots. Since Tony has 4 ropes and he loses 1.2 feet per knot, the total length lost per knot is 4 * 1.2 = 4.8 feet.

Subtract the total length lost due to knots from the total length of all the ropes:
41 - 4.8 = 36.2 feet

So, the length of the rope when Tony is done tying them all together is 36.2 feet.

To determine the total length of the rope Tony will have when tying all the individual ropes together, we first need to calculate the total length of the ropes without considering the loss due to knots.

1. Adding up the lengths of all the ropes:
   - 8 feet
   - 20 feet
   - 2 feet x 3 = 6 feet
   - 7 feet
   Total length of ropes = 8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41 feet

2. Each knot between the ropes causes a loss of 1.2 feet. Since Tony has 4 knots (one between each pair), the total length lost due to these knots is 4 knots x 1.2 feet/knot = 4.8 feet.

3. Subtracting the total length lost to knots from the total length of the ropes:
   - Total length of ropes: 41 feet
   - Total length lost due to knots: 4.8 feet
   - Final length of the rope = 41 - 4.8 = 36.2 feet

Therefore, the total length of the rope when Tony is done tying them all together is 36.2 feet.

To determine the total length of the rope after Tony ties all the pieces together, we first need to calculate the total length of the ropes before accounting for the knots.

The lengths of the ropes are:
- An 8-foot rope
- A 20-foot rope
- Three 2-foot ropes (which total 6 feet)
- A 7-foot rope

Adding these lengths together gives us the total length of the ropes:
8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41 feet

Now, we need to account for the knots. Each knot causes a loss of 1.2 feet, and Tony ties a knot between every piece of rope except between the 8-foot and 20-foot pieces, so there will be 39 knots (since there are 4 pieces of rope, the first knot is between the 8-foot and 20-foot pieces and the last one after the last 2-foot piece).

The total loss due to the knots is:
39 knots * 1.2 feet per knot = 46.8 feet

To find the total length of the rope after accounting for the knots, we subtract the total loss from the total length of the ropes:
41 feet - 46.8 feet = -5.8 feet

The negative value indicates that Tony will actually have less rope than he started with, so the length of the rope will be 0 feet.

Therefore, the total length of the rope after tying all the pieces together will be 0 feet.

First, we need to determine the total length of all the ropes Tony has collected. He has:

- 1 rope that is 8 feet long
- 1 rope that is 20 feet long
- 3 ropes that are each 2 feet long, so 3 * 2 = 6 feet
- 1 rope that is 7 feet long

Adding these together:
8 feet + 20 feet + 6 feet + 7 feet = 41 feet

Now, we need to account for the 1.2 feet lost per knot. Let's calculate the total number of knots:

8 + 20 + 3 * 2 + 7 = 40 knots

Therefore, the total length of the rope lost from knots is:
40 * 1.2 feet = 48 feet

To get the length of the rope after tying them all together, we subtract the total loss from the total length of the ropes:
41 feet - 48 feet = -7 feet

Since the result is negative, it implies that Tony cannot build the rope to the desired length with the ropes he has. He would need at least additional 7 feet of rope to overcome the loss from knots.

First, let's list the total length of the ropes Tony has at the beginning:
- 8 feet
- 20 feet
- 3 * 2 feet = 6 feet
- 7 feet

Next, calculate the sum of these lengths:
\( 8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41 \) feet

Now, determine the number of knots Tony will make. He uses all the ropes together, so there are 4 knots (one between each pair of ropes).

Since each knot causes a loss of 1.2 feet, we calculate the total loss:
\( 4 \times 1.2 = 4.8 \) feet

To find the final length of the rope after tying all the knots together, subtract the total loss from the initial total length:
\( 41 - 4.8 = 36.2 \) feet

Therefore, the length of the rope when all the knots are tied is 36.2 feet.

To determine the total length of Tony's rope, we first need to calculate the total length he initially has. Adding together the lengths of the ropes:

- 3 * 2 feet = 6 feet

So, initially Tony has \(8 + 20 + 6 = 34\) feet of rope.
Next, we need to account for the knots. For each knot, Tony loses 1.2 feet of rope. He has a total of 4 knots, since he ties 4 ropes together (1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 4).
So, the total loss of rope due to knots is \(4 \times 1.2 = 4.8\) feet.
