system
To find out how many pieces of pizza Albert eats, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large and small pizzas he bought.

1. There are 2 large pizzas, and each large pizza has 16 slices.
   \[
   \text{Total slices from large pizzas} = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. There are 2 small pizzas, and each small pizza has 8 slices.
   \[
   \text{Total slices from small pizzas} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. To find the total number of slices from both types of pizzas:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 32 \text{ (from large pizzas)} + 16 \text{ (from small pizzas)} = 48 \text{ slices}
   \]

Therefore, if Albert eats all the slices, he will have eaten 48 pieces of pizza that day.

To determine how many pieces of pizza Albert eats in one day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from both the large and small pizzas.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces from the large pizzas:
- Each large pizza has 16 slices.
- Albert buys 2 large pizzas.

\[
2 \text{ large pizzas} \times 16 \text{ slices per large pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of pieces from the small pizzas:
- Each small pizza has 8 slices.
- Albert buys 2 small pizzas.

\[
2 \text{ small pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per small pizza} = 16 \text{ slices}
\]

Now, we add the number of pieces from all the pizzas together:

\[
32 \text{ slices from large pizzas} + 16 \text{ slices from small pizzas} = 48 \text{ slices}
\]

Therefore, if Albert eats all the pizza, he will eat:

\[
\boxed{48}
\] pieces that day.

Let's calculate the total number of slices Albert can eat:

1 large pizza = 16 slices
2 large pizzas = 2 * 16 = 32 slices

1 small pizza = 8 slices
2 small pizzas = 2 * 8 = 16 slices

Total slices = slices from large pizzas + slices from small pizzas
Total slices = 32 + 16 = 48 slices

Therefore, if Albert eats all the pizzas he bought, he can eat 48 pieces in one day.

system
To determine how many pieces of pizza Albert eats in one day, we can break down the problem into the following steps:  
1. Calculate the total number of slices from the large pizzas. Since each large pizza has 16 slices and he buys 2 large pizzas, the total number of slices from the large pizzas is 16*2 = 32 slices.  
2. Calculate the total number of slices from the small pizzas. Since each small pizza has 8 slices and he buys 2 small pizzas, the total number of slices from the small pizzas is 8*2 = 16 slices.  
3. Add the total number of slices from the large pizzas and the small pizzas to get the total number of pieces of pizza Albert eats in one day. The total number of pieces of pizza Albert eats in one day is 32 + 16 = 48 pieces.  
Therefore, the answer is 48.

To determine how many pieces of pizza Albert eats in one day, we need to calculate the total number of slices from both the large and small pizzas he buys.

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large pizzas:
- He buys 2 large pizzas.
- Each large pizza has 16 slices.

So, the total number of slices from the large pizzas is:
\[ 2 \text{ large pizzas} \times 16 \text{ slices per large pizza} = 32 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small pizzas:
- He buys 2 small pizzas.
- Each small pizza has 8 slices.

So, the total number of slices from the small pizzas is:
\[ 2 \text{ small pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per small pizza} = 16 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from both types of pizzas to find the total number of slices Albert eats in one day:
\[ 32 \text{ slices from large pizzas} + 16 \text{ slices from small pizzas} = 48 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, Albert eats a total of 48 slices of pizza that day.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large pizzas:
2 large pizzas * 16 slices/large pizza = 32 slices

Next, calculate the total number of slices from the small pizzas:
2 small pizzas * 8 slices/small pizza = 16 slices

Now, add the number of slices from both types of pizzas to find the total:
32 slices + 16 slices = 48 slices

So, Albert eats 48 pieces of pizza that day.

<solution>
To find out how many slices of pizza Albert eats, we need to calculate the total number of slices from both the large and small pizzas.

- Large pizzas: 2 large pizzas * 16 slices per large pizza = 32 slices
- Small pizzas: 2 small pizzas * 8 slices per small pizza = 16 slices

Adding these together gives us the total number of slices:

\( \text{Total slices} = 32 \text{ slices from large pizzas} + 16 \text{ slices from small pizzas} = 48 \text{ slices} \)

So, Albert eats 48 pieces of pizza if he eats it all in one day.

To determine how many slices of pizza Albert will eat, we need to calculate the total number of slices from both the large and small pizzas.

- We have 2 large pizzas.

The total number of slices from the large pizzas is:
\[ 2 \text{ large pizzas} \times 16 \text{ slices per large pizza} = 32 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know:

To determine how many pieces of pizza Albert can eat in one day, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large pizzas and the small pizzas separately, and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large pizzas:
- Each large pizza has 16 slices.
- Albert buys 2 large pizzas.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the large pizzas is \(2 \times 16 = 32\).

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small pizzas:
- Each small pizza has 8 slices.
- Albert buys 2 small pizzas.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the small pizzas is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Now, we add the slices from the large pizzas and the small pizzas to get the total number of slices:
\[32 + 16 = 48\]

So, if Albert eats all the pizza, he will eat a total of 48 pieces.

To find out how many pieces of pizza Albert eats in one day, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from both the large and small pizzas.

For the large pizzas:
2 large pizzas * 16 slices each = 32 slices

For the small pizzas:
2 small pizzas * 8 slices each = 16 slices

Now, we add the slices from both types of pizzas:
32 slices from large pizzas + 16 slices from small pizzas = 48 slices

Albert bought a total of 2 + 2 = 4 pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices, and a small pizza has 8 slices, so 2 large pizzas have a total of 2 * 16 slices = 32 slices. 4 pizzas in total have a total of 32 + 2 * 8 = 56 slices. Therefore, Albert eats 56 pieces of pizza a day.
