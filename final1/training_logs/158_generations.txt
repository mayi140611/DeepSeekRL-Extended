system
Total distance = 150 miles.
Days ridden = 12 days.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Days ridden.
Days on the 13th = Total days - Days rider.

Remaining distance = 150 - 12 = 138 miles.
Days on the 13th = 150 - 12 = 138.0 miles.
<answer>
138 miles.

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####


system
To finish his goal, Jerome needs to ride a total of 150 miles. He plans to ride 12 miles for 12 days, which amounts to:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 12 \text{ days} = 144 \text{ miles} \]

The difference between the total goal and the miles ridden for the first 12 days is:

\[ 150 \text{ miles} - 144 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Jerome will ride 6 miles on the 13th day to finish his goal.
