To determine how much Carla spent on 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount for one bag:**
   - Original price per bag: $6.00
   - Discount percentage: 75%

   To find the discount amount for one bag:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = \text{Original price} \times \left( \frac{\text{Discount percentage}}{100} \right)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 6.00 \times \left( \frac{75}{100} \right) = 6.00 \times 0.75 = 4.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the discounted price for one bag:**
   \[
   \text{Discounted price} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted price} = 6.00 - 4.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 2 bags:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Discounted price per bag} \times 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1.50 \times 2 = 3.00
   \]

Therefore, Carla spent $3.00 on 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups.

Carla bought 2 bags at $6.00 each. The discount is 75%, so the discount on each bag is 75/100 * $6.00 = $4.50. Thus Carla gets a total discount of $4.50 * 2 = $9.00 from buying 2 bags. Therefore she spends $6.00 - $4.50 = $1.50 for each bag. Carla bought 2 bags so the total amount Carla spent is $1.50 * 2 = $3.00.

To determine how much Carla spent on the 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount per bag:**
   - Original price per bag: $6.00
   - Discount rate: 75%

   First, we find 75% of $6.00:
   \[
   75\% \text{ of } \$6.00 = \frac{75}{100} \times 6.00 = 0.75 \times 6.00 = \$4.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the discounted price per bag:**
   - Original price per bag: $6.00
   - Discount per bag: $4.50

   Subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Discounted price per bag} = \$6.00 - \$4.50 = \$1.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 2 bags:**
   - Discounted price per bag: $1.50
   - Number of bags: 2

   Multiply the discounted price by the number of bags:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00
   \]

Therefore, Carla spent $3.00 on 2 bags of candy.

To calculate how much Carla spent on two bags of mini peanut butter cups, we first need to determine the discounted price of one bag.

1. Each bag was originally priced at $6.00.
2. The bags were on clearance with a 75% discount.
3. To find the discount amount, we calculate 75% of $6.00:
   \[
   0.75 \times 6 = 4.50
   \]
4. Subtracting the discount from the original price gives the sale price of one bag:
   \[
   6 - 4.50 = 1.50
   \]
5. Since Carla bought two bags, we multiply the sale price by 2:
   \[
   1.50 \times 2 = 3
   \]

So, Carla spent $3.00 on two bags of mini peanut butter cups.

Each bag was $6.00, and it was 75% off, which means she paid 25% of the original price for each bag. So, the discounted price of each bag is $6.00 * 0.25 = $1.50.
Therefore, for 2 bags, Carla spent $1.50/bag * 2 bags = $3.00.

The original price of each bag of mini peanut butter cups is $6.00. Since each bag is 75% off, Carla gets 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $6.00.

\( \frac{25}{100} \times 6.00 = 1.50 \)

So, the discount amount is $1.50 per bag.

Since Carla bought 2 bags, the total discount is \( 1.50 \times 2 = 3.00 \).

The original price of 2 bags is \( 2 \times 6.00 = 12.00 \).

So, the total amount Carla spent is \( 12.00 - 3.00 = 9.00 \).

To determine how much Carla spent on the 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Original Price of One Bag:**
   Each bag originally costs $6.00.

2. **Discount Applied:**
   The bags are 75% off. This means Carla only pays 25% of the original price.

3. **Calculate the Discounted Price:**
   To find out the discounted price per bag, we calculate 25% of the original price:
   \[
   0.25 \times 6.00 = 1.50
   \]
   So, each bag costs $1.50 after the discount.

4. **Total Cost for 2 Bags:**
   Since Carla buys 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups, we multiply the discounted price of one bag by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 1.50 = 3.00
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Carla spent $3.00 on 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups.

Carla bought 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups at a clearance price of $6.00 each, but with a 75% discount. 

To determine the actual price Carla paid for each bag:
- Calculate the discount on one bag: \( 6.00 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \)
- Subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price: \( 6.00 - 4.50 = 1.50 \)

So, Carla pays $1.50 for each bag.

For 2 bags:
- Multiply the sale price per bag by 2: \( 1.50 \times 2 = 3.00 \)

Therefore, Carla spent $3.00 on 2 bags of candy.

To determine how much Carla spent on 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of one bag of candy.
2. Multiply the discounted price of one bag by 2 to get the total cost for 2 bags.

The original price of one bag is $6.00, and it is discounted by 75%, so the discount amount is 75% of $6.00.

\[ \text{Discounted price per bag} = $6.00 - (0.75 \times $6.00) \]

\[ \text{Discounted price per bag} = $6.00 - $4.50 \]

\[ \text{Discounted price per bag} = $1.50 \]

Now, we multiply the discounted price of one bag by 2:

\[ \text{Total cost for 2 bags} = 2 \times $1.50 \]

\[ \text{Total cost for 2 bags} = $3.00 \]

Therefore, Carla spent $3.00 on 2 bags of candy.
