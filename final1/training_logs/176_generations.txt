Each packet weighs 100 grams.
In a week, there are 7 days.
So the number of packets sold in a week is 7 * 20 = 140.
Thus, the store sells 140 * 100 = 14 000 grams of sugar every week.
Since 1000 grams are equal to 1 kilogram, the store sells 14 000 / 1000 = 14 kilograms of sugar every week.

Each packet contains 100 grams of sugar. The store sells 20 packets of 100 grams of sugar every week, which totals to 20 packets * 100 grams/packet = 2000 grams of sugar. Since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, 2000 grams of sugar is equal to 2000 grams / 1000 = 2 kilograms.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####

system
To determine how many kilograms of sugar the store sells every week, we need to first find the total amount of sugar sold in grams and then convert that amount to kilograms.

Given that there are 100 grams in a kilogram, we can convert the total grams sold into kilograms by dividing the total number of grams by 100.

Step 1: Calculate total grams sold per week.
\[ 20 \text{ packets} \times 100 \text{ grams/packet} = 2000 \text{ grams} \]

Step 2: Convert grams to kilograms.
\[ 2000 \text{ grams} \div 100 = 20 \text{ kilograms} \]

Therefore, the store sells 20 kilograms of sugar every week.

The store sells 20 packets of sugar every week, and each packet weighs 100 grams. To find out how many kilograms of sugar it sells every week, we first need to convert the number of grams to kilograms. Since 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams, 100 grams is equal to 0.1 kilograms. Therefore, the store sells 20 packets * 100 grams/packet = 2000 grams/1000 grams = 2 kilograms of sugar every week.

1 packet of sugar weighs 100 grams.
The store sells 20 packets every week.
So, the store sells 20 packets x 100 grams = 2000 grams of sugar.
To convert grams to kilograms, we divide by 1000.

So, the store sells 2000 grams ÷ 1000 = 2 kilograms of sugar every week.

The store sells 20 packets of sugar, each weighing 100 grams. To find the total weight in grams, we multiply the number of packets by the weight of each packet:

\( 20 \text{ packets} \times 100 \text{ grams/packet} = 2000 \text{ grams} \)

To convert grams to kilograms, we divide by 1000:

\( 2000 \text{ grams} \div 1000 = 2 \text{ kilograms} \)
