###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Tommy goes for a run around his neighborhood and decides to calculate how many wheels he saw. All the trucks in his neighborhood have 4 wheels and all the cars in his neighborhood also have 4 wheels. If he saw 12 trucks and 13 cars, how many wheels did he see?

To determine the total number of wheels Tommy saw, we need to consider the number of wheels on each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

1. Each truck has 4 wheels, and Tommy saw 12 trucks.
   - Number of wheels from trucks = 12 trucks × 4 wheels/truck = 48 wheels.

2. Each car has 4 wheels, and Tommy saw 13 cars.
   - Number of wheels from cars = 13 cars × 4 wheels/car = 52 wheels.

3. We add the wheels from trucks and cars to get the total number of wheels.
   - Total wheels = 48 wheels/from trucks + 52 wheels/from cars = 100 wheels.

Therefore, Tommy saw a total of 100 wheels.

Tommy saw the same number of trucks and cars, so he must have seen the trucks as well as the cars.
There were 12 trucks, which means there were 12 trucks * 4 wheels/ truck = 48 truck wheels. There were also 13 cars, which means there were 13 cars * 4 wheels/car = 52 car wheels.
Tommy saw 48 truck wheels + 52 car wheels = 100 wheels

Tommy saw 12 trucks and each truck has 4 wheels, so the total number of truck wheels he saw is 12 trucks * 4 wheels/truck = 48 wheels. Similarly, he saw 13 cars and each car has 4 wheels, so the total number of car wheels he saw is 13 cars * 4 wheels/car = 52 wheels. To find the total number of wheels he saw, we add the number of truck wheels and car wheels together: 48 wheels from trucks + 52 wheels from cars = 100 wheels.

Therefore, the total number of wheels that Tommy saw is 100 wheels.

Tommy saw 12 trucks and each truck has 4 wheels. So, the total number of wheels on the trucks is \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) wheels. Similarly, Tommy saw 13 cars and each car has 4 wheels. So, the total number of wheels on the cars is \( 13 \times 4 = 52 \) wheels. To find the total number of wheels Tommy saw, we add the wheels from the trucks and the cars together. This gives us \( 48 + 52 = 100 \) wheels.

Therefore, Tommy saw 100 wheels.

To determine the total number of wheels Tommy saw, we need to calculate the number of wheels from the trucks and the number of wheels from the cars separately, then sum them up.

1. Each truck has 4 wheels. Since Tommy saw 12 trucks, the total number of wheels from the trucks is calculated as:
   \[
   12 \text{ trucks} \times 4 \text{ wheels/truck} = 48 \text{ wheels}
   \]

2. Each car has 4 wheels. Since Tommy saw 13 cars, the total number of wheels from the cars is calculated as:
   \[
   13 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels/car} = 52 \text{ wheels}
   \]

3. To find the total number of wheels Tommy saw, he simply adds the wheels from the trucks and the wheels from the cars:
   \[
   48 \text{ wheels} + 52 \text{ wheels} = 100 \text{ wheels}
   \]

Therefore, Tommy saw 100 wheels in total.

To determine the total number of wheels Tommy saw, we need to consider both the trucks and the cars.

1. Calculate the total number of wheels for the trucks:
   - Each truck has 4 wheels.
   - Tommy saw 12 trucks.
   - Total wheels for trucks = 4 wheels/truck × 12 trucks = 48 wheels.

2. Calculate the total number of wheels for the cars:
   - Each car has 4 wheels.
   - Tommy saw 13 cars.
   - Total wheels for cars = 4 wheels/car × 13 cars = 52 wheels.

3. Add the total wheels from trucks and cars to get the total number of wheels Tommy saw:
   - Total wheels = 48 wheels (from trucks) + 52 wheels (from cars) = 100 wheels.

Therefore, Tommy saw a total of 100 wheels.

To find the total number of wheels Tommy saw, we need to add the number of wheels from the trucks and the number of wheels from the cars.

1. Each truck has 4 wheels. Tommy saw 12 trucks, so the total number of wheels from the trucks is \(4 \times 12\).
2. Each car has 4 wheels. Tommy saw 13 cars, so the total number of wheels from the cars is \(4 \times 13\).

Let's calculate these values step by step:
- Wheels from trucks: \(4 \times 12 = 48\)
- Wheels from cars: \(4 \times 13 = 52\)

Now, we add the wheels from the trucks and the wheels from the cars:
\[48 + 52 = 100\]

Therefore, Tommy saw a total of 100 wheels.

First, we calculate the total number of wheels from the trucks. Since each truck has 4 wheels, we multiply the number of trucks (12) by 4. 
12 trucks * 4 wheels/truck = 48 wheels

Next, we calculate the total number of wheels from the cars. Since each car also has 4 wheels, we multiply the number of cars (13) by 4.
13 cars * 4 wheels/car = 52 wheels

Finally, we add the number of wheels from the trucks and cars to find the total number of wheels Tommy saw.
48 wheels + 52 wheels = 100 wheels

Therefore, Tommy saw 100 wheels in total.

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels from the trucks and then the total number of wheels from the cars, and finally add these two totals together.

1. Calculate the number of wheels from the trucks:
   - Each truck has 4 wheels.
   - Tommy saw 12 trucks.
   - The total number of wheels from the trucks is \( 4 \text{ wheels/truck} \times 12 \text{ trucks} = 48 \text{ wheels} \).

2. Calculate the number of wheels from the cars:
   - Each car has 4 wheels.
   - Tommy saw 13 cars.
   - The total number of wheels from the cars is \( 4 \text{ wheels/car} \times 13 \text{ cars} = 52 \text{ wheels} \).

3. Add the number of wheels from the trucks and the cars to get the total number of wheels:
   - The total number of wheels is \( 48 \text{ wheels} + 52 \text{ wheels} = 100 \text{ wheels} \).

Therefore, Tommy saw a total of 100 wheels.
