system
To find out how many more sessions Ronald needs, we first need to determine the total number of hamburgers he still needs to cook. We'll subtract the 40 hamburgers he has already cooked from the total required:

\[ 115 - 40 = 75 \]

This means Ronald needs to cook 75 more hamburgers. 

Next, we need to see how many sessions it will take him to cook those 75 hamburgers. Since he can do 15 hamburgers per session, we divide the remaining hamburgers by the amount he can cook per session:

\[ 75 \div 15 = 5 \]

So, it will take him 5 more sessions to finish cooking all the hamburgers.

Ronald needs to cook a total of 115 hamburgers and has already cooked 40, so there are 115 - 40 = 75 hamburgers left to cook.

Ronald can cook 15 hamburgers per session, so the number of sessions required to cook the remaining 75 hamburgers is 75 / 15 = 5 sessions.

Ronald needs to cook a total of 115 hamburgers and has already cooked 40 hamburgers, so he needs to cook \(115 - 40 = 75\) more hamburgers.

Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session, so to cook 75 hamburgers, he will need \(75 \div 15 = 5\) more sessions.

To find out how many additional sessions Ronald needs, we first calculate how many more hamburgers he needs to cook:

\[ 115 - 40 = 75 \text{ hamburgers} \]

Next, we determine how many sessions are needed to cook the remaining 75 hamburgers given that he can grill 15 hamburgers per session:

\[ \frac{75}{15} = 5 \text{ sessions} \]

Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session.

He has already cooked 40 hamburgers.

He needs a total of 115 hamburgers.

To find out how many more hamburgers he needs to cook, we subtract the hamburgers cooked from the total needed:

115 hamburgers (total needed) - 40 hamburgers (already cooked) = 75 more hamburgers to cook.

Now, we divide the remaining hamburgers by the number of hamburgers he can grill per session to find out how many more sessions he needs:

75 hamburgers / 15 hamburgers per session = 5 more sessions.

Therefore, Ronald will need 5 more sessions to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers.

Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session. He needs to cook a total of 115 hamburgers. He has already cooked 40 hamburgers.

First, calculate the remaining number of hamburgers to be cooked:
\[ 115 - 40 = 75 \]

Next, determine how many sessions are needed to grill the remaining 75 hamburgers, knowing he can grill 15 hamburgers per session:
\[ \frac{75}{15} = 5 \]

So, Ronald will need 5 more sessions to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers.

To determine how many more sessions Ronald will need to finish cooking all the hamburgers, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to subtract the number of hamburgers Ronald has already cooked from the total number of hamburgers he needs to cook.
2. Then, we can divide the remaining number of hamburgers by the number of hamburgers he can cook per session.
3. Since Ronald can only complete a full session if he has more than 15 hamburgers left, and he can complete a full session if he has exactly 15 hamburgers left, we'll need to round up to the next whole number if necessary.
4. Finally, we'll add this result to the number of sessions he has already completed.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total hamburgers: 115
   Hamburgers already cooked: 40

   Remaining hamburgers: 115 - 40 = 75

2. Hamburgers per session: 15

   Hamburgers per session for remaining: 75 / 15 = 5

3. Ronald has already completed 1 session (since 40 hamburgers is less than 15, he can't complete a full session).

4. Since 75 hamburgers are more than 15 hamburgers, he will need 1 more session.

Therefore, Ronald will need 1 more session to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers.

Ronald needs to cook a total of 115 hamburgers. He has already cooked 40 hamburgers. So, he still needs to cook \( 115 - 40 = 75 \) hamburgers.

Since Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session, to find out how many sessions he will need to cook the remaining 75 hamburgers, we divide 75 by 15:

\( 75 \div 15 = 5 \) sessions.

Therefore, Ronald will need 5 more sessions to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers.
