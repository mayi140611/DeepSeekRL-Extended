###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

John is very unfit and decides to work up to doing a push-up.  He trains 5 days a week for them and starts with wall push-ups.  He adds 1 rep a day and once he gets to 15 reps he will start training high elevation push-ups. and then low elevation push-ups, and finally floor push-ups.  How many weeks will it take him to get to floor push-ups?

To determine how many weeks it will take John to reach floor push-ups, let's break down his progress:

1. **Wall push-ups:**
   - Starts with 0 reps.
   - Adds 1 rep each day.
   - Needs to reach 15 reps.
   - To calculate the number of days needed to reach 15 reps:
     \[
     15 \text{ reps} = 0 + 1 \times 15 = 15 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **High elevation push-ups:**
   - Once he reaches 15 reps with wall push-ups, he will start high elevation push-ups.
   - He will continue to add 1 rep each day until he reaches 15 reps for high elevation push-ups (which means he has to reach 16 reps total, starting from 15 reps wall push-ups).
   - To calculate the number of days needed to reach 16 reps:
     \[
     16 \text{ reps} = 15 \text{ reps with wall push-ups} + 1 \text{ rep}
     \]

3. **Low elevation push-ups:**
   - He will continue to 15 reps for low elevation push-ups.

4. **Floor push-ups:**
   - He will start with 15 reps and continue to add 1 rep each day until he reaches 15 reps at the floor (15 + 1 = 16 reps total for floor push-ups).
   - To calculate the number of days needed to reach 16 reps:
     \[
     16 \text{ reps} = 15 \text{ reps at floor push-ups} + 1 \text{ rep}
     \]

Since John started with wall push-ups and needs to reach 15 reps to start with high elevation push-ups, we first calculate the days to reach 15 reps for wall push-ups (15 days). Then, he will need 1 more day to reach 16 reps for high elevation push-ups.

The next step is to determine the total number of days for high elevation push-ups:
   - He will need to add 1 rep each day to reach 16 reps.
   - Thus, adding the 1 day for high elevation push-ups:
     \[
     15 \text{ days wall push-ups} + 1 \text{ day high elevation push-ups} = 16 \text{ days}
     \]

Finally, adding the days for low elevation push-ups and floor push-ups:
   - He will continue to add 1 day each for low elevation and floor push-ups to reach 15 reps again:
     \[
     15 \text{ days} + 1 \text{ day each} = 16 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, it takes John **16 days** to reach floor push-ups.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total days by 7 to find out how many weeks it will take:
   \[
   \frac{16 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 2.29 \text{ weeks}
   \]
   
Rounding up:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take John **3 weeks** to get to floor push-ups.

To determine how many weeks it will take John to get to floor push-ups, we need to follow the progress he makes each day and calculate the total number of days required.

1. **Wall Push-ups**: John starts with wall push-ups and adds 1 rep each day. He needs to reach 15 reps. Since he starts with 0 reps, he needs 15 days to reach 15 reps (1 day to reach 1 rep, 2 days to reach 2 reps, and so on up to 15 days to reach 15 reps). To reach 15 reps, he will train for:
   \[
   15 \text{ days}
   \]
   On the 15th day, he will switch to High-Elevation Push-Ups.

2. **High-Elevation Push-ups**: After 15 days of wall push-ups, John will move to High-Elevation Push-Ups. He needs to reach 15 reps again. He will follow the same progression as before, so he will train for another 15 days to reach 15 reps on High-Elevation Push-Ups.

3. **Low-Elevation Push-ups**: Once he has reached 15 reps on High-Elevation Push-Ups, he will start High-Elevation Push-Ups again. He will follow the same progression as before, so he will train for another 15 days to reach 15 reps on Low-Elevation Push-Ups.

4. **Floor Push-ups**: Once he has reached 15 reps on Low-Elevation Push-Ups, he will start Low-Elevation Push-Ups. He will follow the same progression as before, so he will train for another 15 days to reach 15 reps on Floor Push-Ups.

5. **Total Weeks**: Since he starts with wall push-ups and it takes 15 days to get to 15 reps, he will do this process 3 times (for wall push-ups, high-elevation push-ups, and low-elevation push-ups). Therefore, the total number of weeks is:
   \[
   15 \text{ days} \times 3 = 45 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take John 45 days to get to floor push-ups.

To determine how many weeks it will take John to reach floor push-ups, we need to calculate the total number of days required to reach 15 reps and then convert that into weeks.

1. **Days to reach 15 reps:**
   - John starts with wall push-ups, where he does 0 rep each day.
   - He adds 1 rep to his wall push-ups each day.
   - To reach 15 reps, he needs to add 15 reps.

2. **Calculating the number of days:**
   - On the first day, John will do 1 rep.
   - On the second day, John will do 2 reps.
   - This pattern continues until he is doing 15 reps.
   - The total number of days required to get to 15 reps is \(14\) days (since he starts with 1 rep on the first day, which means 1 plus the 14 additional reps needed to reach 15).

3. **Calculating the total number of weeks:**
   - John trains 5 days a week.
   - To find out how many weeks it takes to complete 14 days, we divide the number of days by the number of training days per week: \( \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \) weeks.
   - Since John can only train in whole weeks, we round up to the next whole number, which is 3 weeks.

**Therefore, it will take John 3 weeks to get to floor push-ups.**

Starting with wall push-ups, John progresses as follows:
- First week: 1 rep
- Second week: 2 reps
- Third week: 3 reps
- Fourth week: 4 reps
- Fifth week: 5 reps (reaches 5 reps and starts the elevation training)

Since he goes up by 1 rep each day, the progression follows the sequence:
- Wall push-ups: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (5 reps)
- High elevation push-ups: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (5 reps)

At this point, he has trained for 10 weeks and has 10 reps (5 from each training session). Since he starts training the next week with 11 reps, he needs 5 more weeks to reach 15 reps.

He will then start with low elevation push-ups.

At this point, he has reached his goal of 15 reps. Because each subsequent session adds 1 rep, and he'll need 1 more rep to reach the final goal of floor push-ups:

So he will need 1 more week to reach floor push-ups.

Therefore, it will take him a total of 15 weeks to get to floor push-ups.

To find out how many weeks it will take John to get to floor push-ups, we need to calculate the number of weeks it takes him to reach 15 reps, as this is the threshold for each new type of push-up as mentioned.

John starts with 1 rep and adds 1 each day. Thus, to reach 15 reps, he needs to add 14 reps over the course of weeks.

Let's calculate the number of weeks required for him to reach 15 reps:
1 repetition per day.
14 repetitions, divided by 1 rep per day = 14 days

Since 1 week consists of 7 days, we need to convert this into weeks:
14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to train up to 15 push-up repetitions.

The next step is to determine how many weeks it will take John to reach 15 high elevation push-up repetitions and then 15 low elevation push-up repetitions, and finally floor push-ups.

Since John adds 1 rep daily, to reach 15 reps, it will take him 14 more days. 
14 days divided by 7 days per week = 2 weeks.

Thus, it will take him an additional 2 weeks to reach 15 high elevation push-ups. Adding these to the previous weeks, we get:
2 weeks plus 2 weeks = 4 weeks.

It will take John a total of 4 weeks to reach floor push-ups.

To determine how many weeks it will take John to get to floor push-ups, we need to calculate the number of days it takes for him to reach 15 reps of wall push-ups, then to the next level, and finally to floor push-ups.

1. **Wall to High Elevation:**
   - John starts with wall push-ups and adds 1 rep every day until he reaches 15 reps.
   - Number of days to reach 15 reps of wall push-ups: \(15 - 1 = 14\) days.

   Since he trains 5 days a week, the number of weeks required is \(\frac{14}{5}\). This is a whole number plus a remaining fraction of a week. Let's calculate it:
   \[
   \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \text{ weeks}
   \]
   Since he can't train a fraction of a week, we round up to 3 weeks.

2. **High Elevation to Low Elevation:**
   - He trains for 3 weeks, adding 1 rep each day until he reaches 15 reps for high elevation push-ups.
   - Number of days to reach 15 reps of high elevation push-ups: \(15 - 1 = 14\) days.

   Again, he trains 5 days a week, so the number of weeks required is:
   \[
   \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \text{ weeks}
   \]
   Similarly, we round up to 3 weeks.

   So, the total weeks taken so far: \(3 + 3 = 6\) weeks.

3. **Low Elevation to Floor:**
   - He trains for 6 weeks, adding 1 rep each day until he reaches 15 reps for low elevation push-ups.
   - Number of days to reach 15 reps of low elevation push-ups: \(15 - 1 = 14\) days.

   Again, he trains 5 days a week, so the number of weeks required is:
   \[
   \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \text{ weeks}
   \]
   We round up to 3 weeks.

   So, the total weeks taken so far: \(6 + 3 = 9\) weeks.

   Now, \(15 - 1 = 14\) weeks remain for him to reach 15 reps for floor push-ups.

4. **From Low Elevation to Floor:**
   - Finally, he trains for 14 days to reach 15 reps for floor push-ups.

   Since the training is 5 days a week, the number of weeks required is:
   \[
   \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \text{ weeks}
   \]
   We round up to 3 weeks.

   So, the total weeks taken so far: \(9 + 3 = 12\) weeks.

Therefore, it will take him 12 weeks to get to floor push-ups.

To determine how many weeks it will take John to get to floor push-ups, we need to calculate the number of days he will spend training for each type of push-up until he reaches 15 reps.

First, let's find out how many days it will take him to reach 15 reps of wall push-ups. Since he starts with wall push-ups and adds 1 rep per day, we divide 15 by 1:

15 reps / 1 rep per day = 15 days

This means it will take him 15 days to reach 15 reps of wall push-ups. Since he trains 5 days a week, we divide 15 by 5 to find out how many weeks it takes:

15 days / 5 days per week = 3 weeks

Now, let's calculate how many days it will take him to reach 15 reps of high elevation push-ups. Similarly, we divide 15 by 1 to find out how many days it will take to reach 15 reps:

15 reps / 1 rep per day = 15 days

Again, since he trains 5 days a week, we divide 15 by 5 to find the number of weeks:

15 days / 5 days per week = 3 weeks

Continuing the same process, we'll calculate the days until he reaches 15 reps of low elevation push-ups. This will also take him 3 weeks. And finally, reaching floor push-ups will also take him 3 weeks.

Adding all these weeks together, we get:

3 weeks + 3 weeks + 3 weeks + 3 weeks = 12 weeks

Thus, it will take John a total of 12 weeks to get to floor push-ups.

To determine how many weeks it will take John to get to floor push-ups, we need to calculate the number of days he will take to reach 15 reps at each step and then convert those days into weeks.

1. **Wall push-ups to 15 reps:**
   - He starts with 0 reps and adds 1 rep per day.
   - To reach 15 reps, he needs to add 15 reps - 0 reps = 15 days.
   - This will take him 15 / 5 days per week = 3 weeks.

2. **High elevation push-ups:**
   - Once he reaches 15 reps, he moves to high elevation push-ups.
   - This step isn't relevant to the calculation since the question only asks about the time to reach floor push-ups.

3. **Low elevation push-ups:**
   - After reaching high elevation push-ups, he moves to low elevation push-ups.
   - This step isn't relevant to the calculation as well.

4. **Floor push-ups:**
   - Eventually, he will move to floor push-ups.
   - This step isn't clearly specified, but based on the problem, we assume he reaches floor push-ups as his final step.

Since the problem doesn't specify the exact number of days it takes to reach floor push-ups from high elevation push-ups, we'll assume that the number of days remains the same as it was for high elevation push-ups (3 weeks).

5. **Time to floor push-ups:**
   - The total time to reach floor push-ups will be the same as the time to reach high elevation push-ups, which is 3 weeks.

Therefore, it will take him 3 weeks to get to floor push-ups.

John starts with wall push-ups and trains 5 days a week. He adds 1 rep each day until he reaches 15 reps. Each day, he adds one rep, and from 15 reps onwards, he would reach the floor push-ups.

To find out how many days it takes to reach 15 reps, we can calculate:

\(15 \div 1 = 15\) days

After reaching 15 reps, John will start training high elevation push-ups, which is the next level. Thus, 15 more days of wall push-ups and 1 day before starting his training for high elevation push-ups.

\(15 + 1 = 16\) days
+ 1 day of high elevation push-ups

Now, John will start with low elevation push-ups for the next 15 days.

\(16 + 15 = 31\) days
+ 1 day of low elevation push-ups

Finally, John will start with floor push-ups. Since floor push-ups were the last level he trained for, he will just train with floor push-ups from the start.

\(31 + 1 = 32\) days

Now, \(32 \div 5 = 6\) weeks and \(2\) days.

Therefore, it will take John \(6\) weeks and \(2\) days to reach floor push-ups.

To determine how many weeks it will take John to get to floor push-ups, we need to understand his progression:

1. John starts with wall push-ups.
2. He adds 1 rep a day.
3. He reaches 15 reps and starts training high elevation push-ups.
4. Once he reaches 15 reps in high elevation push-ups, he starts training low elevation push-ups.
5. Once he reaches 15 reps in low elevation push-ups, he starts training floor push-ups.

The key is that John adds 1 rep per day. Therefore, to reach 15 reps, he will need 15 days.

Since he trains 5 days a week, 15 days will be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Number of days}}{\text{Days per week}} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

So, it will take John 3 weeks to reach floor push-ups.

To determine how many weeks it will take John to get to floor push-ups, we first calculate the number of weeks for each level of push-ups.

1. Wall push-ups:
   - He starts with 1 rep and adds 1 rep each day.
   - He needs to reach 15 reps.
   - This will take:
     \[
     15 \text{ reps} / 1 \text{ rep/day} = 15 \text{ days}
     \]
   - Therefore, it will take 15 days to get to 15 wall push-ups.

2. High elevation push-ups:
   - He will add 1 rep daily.
   - He needs to reach 15 reps.
   - This will take:
     \[
     15 \text{ reps} / 1 \text{ rep/day} = 15 \text{ days}
     \]
   - Therefore, it will take 15 days to get to 15 high elevation push-ups.

3. Low elevation push-ups:
   - He will add 1 rep daily.
   - He needs to reach 15 reps.
   - This will take:
     \[
     15 \text{ reps} / 1 \text{ rep/day} = 15 \text{ days}
     \]
   - Therefore, it will take 15 days to get to 15 low elevation push-ups.

4. Floor push-ups:
   - He will add 1 rep daily.
   - He needs to reach 15 reps.
   - This will take:
     \[
     15 \text{ reps} / 1 \text{ rep/day} = 15 \text{ days}
     \]
   - Therefore, it will take 15 days to get to 15 floor push-ups.

Since each level takes 15 days and he needs to progress through all 4 levels, the total number of days required is:
\[
15 \text{ days/level} \times 4 \text{ levels} = 60 \text{ days}
\]

Next, we convert the total number of days into weeks:
\[
\text{Total weeks} = \frac{60 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}}
\]

\[
\text{Total weeks} = \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \text{ weeks}
\]

Since partial weeks do not count as weeks in this context, we round up to the nearest whole number:
\[
\text{Total weeks} \approx 9 \text{ weeks}
\]

Finally, we address the correctness of the given information and the question itself.

The correct reasoning is:

1. To calculate the number of days John needs to progress through each level of push-ups.
2. The total number of days required is 60 days.
3. To convert days to weeks, we divide the total days by the number of days per week (7 days/week).
4. Since partial weeks do not count, we round up to the nearest whole number of weeks.

Thus, it will take John approximately 9 weeks to get to floor push-ups.

To determine how many weeks it will take John to get to floor push-ups, we need to break down his training process into stages and calculate the number of days it will take to reach each stage, then convert those days into weeks.

1. **Wall Push-Ups:**
   - John starts with 5 days a week for wall push-ups. 
   - He adds 1 rep a day. 
   - Starting with 0 reps, he needs to reach 15 reps.
   - Number of days to reach 15 reps = 15 - 0 = 15 days.

2. **High Elevation Push-Ups:**
   - John then moves to high elevation push-ups, which typically involve elevated surfaces or higher elevation.
   - Let's assume it takes the same amount of time for high elevation as wall push-ups (5 days).
   - Number of days to reach high elevation push-ups = 5 days.

3. **Low Elevation Push-Ups:**
   - High elevation push-ups are often a good way to progress to low elevation push-ups, which are usually performed on the ground.
   - Let's assume it takes the same amount of time for low elevation as wall push-ups (5 days).
   - Number of days to reach low elevation push-ups = 5 days.

4. **Floor Push-Ups:**
   - Finally, John moves to floor push-ups, which are typically performed on the floor.
   - Assuming the number of days to reach floor push-ups from high elevation is the same as the number of days to reach high elevation (5 days).
   - Number of days to reach floor push-ups = 5 days.

Now, we sum up the days it takes for each stage:
\[ 15 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 30 \text{ days} \]

Since John trains 5 days a week, we convert the total number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/week}} = 6 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John 6 weeks to get to floor push-ups.

To determine how many weeks it will take John to get to floor push-ups, let's break down his progress step by step.

1. **Starting Reps**: John starts with wall push-ups, and each day he adds 1 rep.

2. **Reaching 15 Reps**: John needs to reach 15 reps before he can move up to high elevation push-ups.

3. **Reaching 15 Reps in Weeks**: 
   - If John starts with 1 rep and adds 1 rep each day, he will reach 15 reps after 14 days.
   - Since 14 days is 2 weeks (14 days / 7 days/week = 2 weeks), it will take him 2 weeks to reach 15 reps.

4. **Starting High Elevation Push-ups**: After reaching 15 reps, John will start training high elevation push-ups, which are not floor push-ups, so he will not need any additional weeks.

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to get to floor push-ups.

2. Wall push-ups: 15 rep is required to move to the next level.
3. High elevation push-ups: 40 reps (15 + 25) is required.
4. Low elevation push-ups: 50 rep (40 + 10) is required.
5. Floor push-ups: 100 reps (50 + 50) is required.

The total number of rep to reach floor push-ups is 100 reps. He trains 5 days a week, and each day he increases by 1 rep. This is an arithmetic sequence where the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms is:

\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a_{1} + (n-1)d) \]

where:
- \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) terms.
- \( a_1 \) is the first term (1 rep).
- \( d \) is the common difference (1 rep).
- \( n \) is the number of terms.

Here, \( S_n = 100 \) reps, \( a_1 = 1 \), and \( d = 1 \). We want to find \( n \) such that:

\[ 100 = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \cdot 1 + (n-1) \cdot 1) \]
\[ 100 = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 + n - 1) \]
\[ 100 = \frac{n}{2} \times (n + 1) \]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[ 200 = n \times (n + 1) \]
\[ n^2 + n - 200 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -200 \):

\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-200)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 800}}{2} \]
\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{801}}{2} \]

Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:

\[ n = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{801}}{2} \]

Calculating the square root of 801:

\[ \sqrt{801} \approx 28.29 \]

So:

\[ n = \frac{-1 + 28.29}{2} \approx \frac{27.29}{2} \approx 13.645 \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we need to round up because John can only complete the push-ups in full reps on each day of training:

\[ n = 14 \]

Therefore, it will take John 14 days to train up to 100 reps and reach floor push-ups.
