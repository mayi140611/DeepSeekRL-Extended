system
<reasoning>
First, we need to determine the daily cost of Jon's coffee. Since he buys 2 coffees a day and each coffee costs $2, the daily cost is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars. Next, we calculate the cost for the month of April. April typically has 30 days, so the total cost for April would be \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \) dollars.

To break this down into a step-by-step reasoning process:

1. Calculate the daily cost: \( 2 \text{ coffees/day} \times \$2 \text{ per coffee} = \$4 \text{ per day} \)
2. Calculate the total number of days in April: \( 30 \text{ days} \)
3. Calculate the total cost for April: \( \$4 \text{ per day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$120 \text{ per month} \)

Therefore, Jon spends $120 in April on coffee.

Jon buys 2 coffees a day at a cost of $2 each. To find out how much he spends in a day, we multiply the number of coffees by the cost per coffee: 2 coffees/day * $2/coffee = $4/day.

April typically has 30 days. To find out how much Jon spends in April, we multiply the daily expenditure by the number of days in April: $4/day * 30 days = $120.

So, Jon spends $120 in April.

To determine how much Jon spends on coffee in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in April:**
   April typically has 30 days.

2. **Calculate the total number of coffees Jon buys in April:**
   Jon buys 2 coffees every day.
   \[
   \text{Total coffees} = 2 \, \text{coffees/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{coffees}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of each coffee:**
   Each coffee costs $2.

4. **Calculate the total cost for all the coffees:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 60 \, \text{coffees} \times \$2/\text{coffee} = \$120
   \]

So, Jon spends a total of $120 in April.

To determine how much Jon spends on coffee in April, we need to calculate the total cost of the coffees he purchases throughout the month.

1. **Calculate daily cost**: Jon buys 2 coffees a day. Each coffee costs $2.
   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 2 \text{ coffees/day} \times \$2/\text{coffee} = \$4/\text{day}
   \]

2. **Calculate monthly cost**: April has 30 days. Therefore, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in April.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$4/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$120
   \]

So, Jon spends a total of \$120 on coffee in April.

First, we need to find the total number of days in April. April typically has 30 days.

Jon buys 2 coffees a day, so his total cost for coffees per day is 2 * $2 = $4.

To find out how much he spends in April, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in April: $4 * 30 = $120.

Therefore, Jon spends $120 in April.

To determine how much Jon spends on coffee in April, we first need to calculate the total number of days in April. April has 30 days. Jon buys 2 coffees a day, each costing $2. Therefore, the total cost per day is \(2 \times 2 = \$4\). Over the course of 30 days, the total amount spent would be \(30 \times 4 = \$120\).

Additionally, we must consider whether Jon's coffee purchase is consistent with the information provided or if there's a potential oversight. Since the problem doesn't specify whether Jon changes coffee shops or has a variable expenditure per coffee, we will use the given data to calculate the expenditure.

The total expenditure for April is therefore \(\boxed{120}\).

But, if it's understood that Jon's coffee purchase is consistent with the provided information, then we should state that the total expenditure for April is \(\boxed{120}\).

To determine how much Jon spends on coffee in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days in April.
2. Determine the total number of coffees Jon buys over April.
3. Calculate the cost of all the coffees by multiplying the number of coffees by the cost of each coffee.

April typically has 30 days. Jon buys 2 coffees each day, so over 30 days, he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ coffees/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ coffees} \]

Each coffee costs $2, so the total cost for 60 coffees is:
\[ 60 \text{ coffees} \times 2 \text{ dollars/coffee} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jon spends $120 in April.

To determine how much Jon spends on coffee in April, we first need to calculate the total number of days in April. Since April has 30 days, we can multiply the number of coffees Jon buys daily (2) by the number of days in April (30) to find the total number of coffees John buys in the month.

Total coffees bought in April = 2 coffees/day * 30 days = 60 coffees

Next, we need to determine how much he spends on each coffee. Since the cost of each coffee is $2, we can multiply the total number of coffees bought in April (60) by the cost of each coffee ($2) to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent on April = 60 coffees * $2/coffee = $120

Therefore, Jon spends $120 on coffee in April.
