Let's start by calculating the ages of each sister.

Cindy was 5 years old.
Jan was 2 years older than Cindy, so Jan is \(5 + 2 = 7\) years old.
Marcia was twice as old as Jan, so Marcia is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) years old.

Greg was two years older than Marcia, so Greg is \(14 + 2 = 16\) years old.

To determine Greg's age, we need to calculate the ages of each sibling step by step.

1. Cindy was 5 years old.
2. Jan was 2 years older than Cindy, so Jan's age is \(5 + 2 = 7\) years.
3. Marcia was twice as old as Jan, so Marcia's age is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) years.
4. Greg was two years older than Marcia, so Greg's age is \(14 + 2 = 16\) years.

Therefore, Greg is 16 years old.

To determine Greg's age, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy is 5 years old.
2. Jan is 2 years older than Cindy, so Jan is 5 + 2 = 7 years old.
3. Marcia is twice as old as Jan, so Marcia is 2 * 7 = 14 years old.
4. Greg is two years older than Marcia, so Greg is 14 + 2 = 16 years old.

Therefore, Greg is 16 years old.

To find Greg's age, we need to follow the given relationships step by step:
1. Cindy is 5 years old.
2. Jan is 2 years older than Cindy. So, Jan's age is $5 + 2 = 7$ years old.
3. Marcia is twice as old as Jan. So, Marcia's age is $2 \times 7 = 14$ years old.
4. Greg is two years older than Marcia. So, Greg's age is $14 + 2 = 16$ years old.

According to these logical steps, the answer is that Greg is 16 years old.

We start by finding Jan's age. Since Jan is 2 years older than Cindy, and Cindy is 5 years old, Jan is \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) years old.

Next, we find Marcia's age. Marcia is twice as old as Jan, so Marcia is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) years old.

Finally, we find Greg's age. Greg is two years older than Marcia, so Greg is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) years old.

Therefore, Greg is 16 years old.

Cindy was 5 years old.

Jan was 2 years older than Cindy:
Jan = Cindy + 2
Jan = 5 + 2
Jan = 7 years old

Marcia was twice as old as Jan:
Marcia = 2 * Jan
Marcia = 2 * 7
Marcia = 14 years old

Greg was two years older than Marcia:
Greg = Marcia + 2
Greg = 14 + 2
Greg = 16 years old

Therefore, Greg was 16 years old.

To determine Greg's age, we need to calculate the ages of Jan, Marcia, and finally Greg step by step.

1. Cindy's age is given as 5 years.
2. Jan is 2 years older than Cindy. Therefore, Jan is:
   \[
   5 + 2 = 7 \text{ years old}

3. Marcia is twice as old as Jan. Therefore, Marcia's age is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ years old}
