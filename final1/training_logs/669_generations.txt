To determine how much Johnny pays for the ping pong balls, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the normal total cost without any discounts:**
   Johnny buys 10,000 ping pong balls at $0.10 each.
   \[
   \text{Normal total cost} = 10,000 \times 0.10 = 1,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total discount:**
   Johnny gets a 30% discount on the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 1,000 \times 0.30 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount Johnny pays after the discount:**
   Subtract the total discount from the normal total cost.
   \[
   \text{Payable amount} = 1,000 - 300 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Verify the result with the price per ball:**
   If Johnny buys 10,000 balls at the discounted price of $0.10 each:
   \[
   \text{Payable amount per ball} = \frac{700}{10,000} = 0.07 \text{ dollars per ball}
   \]

The final amount Johnny pays is $\boxed{700}$.

First, let's calculate the total cost without any discount. Johnny buys 10000 ping pong balls at $0.10 each.

\[ \text{Total Cost Without Discount} = 10000 \times $0.10 = $1000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% discount. To do this, first determine the discount amount:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times 0.30 = $300 \]

Subtract the discount from the original total cost to get the final amount Johnny pays:

\[ \text{Total Cost After Discount} = 1000 - 300 = $700 \]

To determine how much Johnny pays, we first need to calculate the total cost before any discount and then apply the discount.

The cost of one ping pong ball is $0.10. Since Johnny buys 10000 ping pong balls, the total cost before discount would be:

\[ 10000 \text{ balls} \times $0.10 \text{ per ball} = $1000.00 \]

Johnny gets a 30% discount, so he pays 70% of the total cost. To calculate the discounted price:

\[ 70\% \text{ of } $1000.00 = 0.70 \times $1000.00 = $700.00 \]

So Johnny pays $700.00 after the 30% discount.

To determine how much Johnny pays for the ping pong balls, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost before the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to find the final amount Johnny pays.

First, the cost per ping pong ball is $0.10. Johnny buys 10,000 ping pong balls, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 0.10 \times 10,000 = \$1,000 \]

Next, Johnny gets a 30% discount on the total cost. This means he only pays 70% of the original cost. To find out how much he pays with the discount, we calculate:
\[ 1,000 \times (1 - 0.30) = 1,000 \times 0.70 = \$700 \]

Therefore, the amount Johnny pays is $700.

Let's calculate Johnny's total cost step by step.

1. First, determine the cost of 10000 ping pong balls without the discount:
\[ 10000 \text{ balls} \times \$0.10 \text{ per ball} = \$1000 \]

2. Calculate the discount. Johnny gets a 30% discount. To find out how much the discount is:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$1000 = 0.30 \times \$1000 = \$300 \]

3. Subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Johnny actually pays:
\[ \$1000 - \$300 = \$700 \]

So, Johnny pays \$700 for the 10000 ping pong balls after the discount.

Johnny buys 10000 ping pong balls at $0. 10 each, so he would normally pay 10000 * $0. 10 = $1000.
He gets a 30% discount, which means he pays 100% - 30% = 70% of the original price.
Therefore, he pays 1000 * 70% = $700.

To calculate the total cost Johnny pays, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total price without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount from the total price to find the final amount paid.

We know:
- Each ping pong ball costs $0.10.
- Johnny buys 10,000 ping pong balls.
- He gets a 30% discount.

First, the total price without the discount is:
\[ 10000 \text{ balls} \times \$0.10/\text{ball} = \$1000 \]

Next, we calculate the discount amount, which is 30% of the total price:
\[ 30\% \times \$1000 = 0.30 \times \$1000 = \$300 \]

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total price to find the final amount paid:
\[ \$1000 - \$300 = \$700 \]

Therefore, Johnny pays \$700.

To find out how much Johnny pays for the ping pong balls, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount. Since each ball costs $0.10 and he buys 10000 balls, the initial cost is $0.10 * 10000 = $1000. 

Next, we apply the 30% discount to this amount for his bulk purchase. 30% of $1000 is $1000 * 0.30 = $300. 

The total discount is $300. Subsequently, subtract that discount from the initial cost: $1000 - $300 = $700.

This amount is the total cost that Johnny must pay for buying these balls.

To calculate how much Johnny pays for the ping pong balls, we first need to determine the total cost without the discount and then apply the discount.

1. The original price per ping pong ball is $0.10.
2. Johnny is buying 10,000 ping pong balls.

The total original cost is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of balls} \times \text{Price per ball} = 10,000 \times 0.10 = 1,000 \]

3. Johnny gets a 30% discount on the total cost for buying in bulk.

The amount of the discount is:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Total Cost} \times \text{Discount Rate} = 1,000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

4. The final cost after applying the discount is:

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the original cost without any discount. Since each ping pong ball sells for $.10, we multiply this by the number of balls Johnny is buying (10000 balls).
   $10 × 10000 = $10000

2. Now, we need to apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Johnny pays 70% of the original price.

3. To find out how much Johnny pays after the discount, we need to calculate 70% of the original price.
   $10000 × 0.70 = $7000

4. To find the final cost after the discount, we can calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price before the discount.
   $10000 - ($10000 × 0.30) = $10000 - $3000 = $7000

5. Alternatively, we can calculate the cost directly by multiplying the discounted price by the number of balls.
   $10 × (10000 × (1 - 0.30)) = $10 × 7000 = $7000

Therefore, the final amount Johnny pays for the ping pong balls after a 30% discount is $7000.

To find out how much Johnny pays for the ping pong balls, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to find the final price.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost without the discount
Johnny buys 10000 ping pong balls at $0.10 each.
Total cost = 10000 * $0.10 = $1000

Step 2: Apply the 30% discount
The discount is 30%, so Johnny gets a 30% reduction on his total cost.

Discount amount = 30% of $1000
                   = 0.30 * $1000
                   = $300

Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final price
Final price = Total cost - Discount amount
            = $1000 - $300
            = $700

So, Johnny pays $700 for the ping pong balls.

To determine how much Johnny pays for the ping pong balls, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price per ping pong ball.
2. Multiply the discounted price by the number of ping pong balls Johnny bought.

Firstly, let's calculate the discounted price per ping pong ball. Since Johnny gets a 30% discount, the price per ping pong ball after the discount is:

\[ \text{Discounted price per ball} = 0.10 - (0.10 \times 0.30) = 0.10 - 0.03 = 0.07 \]

So, the price Johnny pays for each ping pong ball is $0.07.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10000 ping pong balls:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 10000 \times 0.07 = 700 \]

Therefore, Johnny pays $700 for the ping pong balls.

To determine how much Johnny pays for the ping pong balls after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the final amount Johnny has to pay after the discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost without the discount.
Johnny buys 10,000 ping pong balls, and each ball costs $0.10.
\[
\text{Total cost without discount} = 10,000 \times 0.10 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
