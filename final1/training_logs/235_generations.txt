#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####


system
Max asks for 1+2 = 3 trains per year.
Max gets 3*5 = 15 trains in the first 5 years.
Thus Max has 15*2 = 30 trains.

So he has 30 trains + 15 trains = 45 trains.

At the end of the 5 years, his parents give him double the number of trains he already has.
Thus, their final gift is 2*15 = 30 trains.

So in total, Max has 45 + 30 = 75 trains.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####


system
Max gets 1 train for his birthday and 2 trains for Christmas each year for 5 years. So, he gets a total of \(5 \times (1 + 2) = 5 \times 3 = 15\) trains over the 5 years. After receiving these trains, his parents give him double the number he already has. So, he receives \(15 \times 2 = 30\) more trains. 

Therefore, the total number of trains Max has now is \(15 + 30 = 45\).
