###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Brian can only hold his breath underwater for 10 seconds.  He wants to get better, so he starts practicing.  After a week, he's doubled the amount of time he can do it.  After another week, he's doubled it again from the previous week.  The final week, he's increased it by 50% from the previous week.  How long can Brian hold his breath for now?

After one week, Brian can hold his breath for 10 * 2 = 20 seconds. 
After two weeks, Brian can hold his breath for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. 
After three weeks, Brian can hold his breath for 40 * 1.5 = 60 seconds.

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####

system
Brian can initially hold his breath for 10 seconds. After the first week, his breath-holding time doubles:
\[ 10 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 20 \text{ seconds} \]

After another week, his breath-holding time doubles again:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, in the final week, he increases it by 50%, so he adds 50% of 40 seconds to his previous time:
\[ 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.5 = 20 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ 40 \text{ seconds} + 20 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

So, after practicing for 3 weeks, Brian can hold his breath for 60 seconds.

Let's calculate step by step:

1. Initially, Brian can hold his breath for 10 seconds.
2. After the first week, he doubles the time, so he can hold his breath for \(10 \times 2 = 20\) seconds.
3. After the second week, he doubles it again, so he can now hold his breath for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
4. In the final week, he increases it by 50%, so he can hold his breath for \(40 \times 1.5 = 60\) seconds.

Therefore, Brian can hold his breath for 60 seconds now.

Initial time = 10 seconds.
After the first week, the time doubles to 2 * 10 = 20 seconds.
After the second week, the time doubles again to 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
After the third week, the time increases by 50% of the previous week, which is 0.5 * 40 = 20 seconds.
So, the total time now is 40 + 20 = 60 seconds.

To calculate the final time Brian can hold his breath, we can follow these steps:

1. After the first week, Brian can hold his breath for \(10 \times 2 = 20\) seconds.
2. After the second week, since he doubles the time again, he can hold his breath for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. After the third week, since he increases the time by 50%, he can now hold his breath for \(40 \times 1.5 = 60\) seconds.

So the final time Brian can hold his breath for is 60 seconds.
