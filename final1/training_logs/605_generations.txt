<reasoning>
Let's start by determining the number of green marbles. Since there are three times more green marbles than red marbles, and there are 20 red marbles, the number of green marbles is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many yellow marbles there are. Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles, so:
\[ 0.20 \times 60 = 12 \]

Now, let's denote the number of marbles of a different color as \( x \). The total number of marbles in the box is given as three times the number of green marbles:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

The total number of marbles can be expressed as the sum of all the specific colored marbles and the marbles of a different color:
\[ 20 \, (\text{red}) + 60 \, (\text{green}) + 12 \, (\text{yellow}) + x \, (\text{other color}) = 180 \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ 20 + 60 + 12 + x = 180 \]
\[ 92 + x = 180 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 180 - 92 \]
\[ x = 88 \]

So, the number of marbles of a different color is 88.

Let's start by defining the number of green marbles. Let $G$ represent the number of green marbles.

Given that there are three times more green marbles than red marbles:
\[ G = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, let's determine the number of yellow marbles. Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles:
\[ Y = 0.2 \times G = 0.2 \times 60 = 12 \]

Now, we know the total number of marbles in the box is three times the number of green marbles:
\[ \text{Total} = 3 \times G = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

The number of marbles of each color is as follows:
- Red: 20
- Green: 60
- Yellow: 12

To find the number of marbles of different colors, we subtract the sum of the number of red, green, and yellow marbles from the total number of marbles:

\[ \text{Different colored marbles} = \text{Total} - (\text{Red} + \text{Green} + \text{Yellow}) \]
\[ \text{Different colored marbles} = 180 - (20 + 60 + 12) \]
\[ \text{Different colored marbles} = 180 - 92 \]
\[ \text{Different colored marbles} = 88 \]

Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 20 red marbles.
2. There are three times more green marbles than red marbles, so there are \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) green marbles.
3. Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles, so there are \( 0.2 \times 60 = 12 \) yellow marbles.
4. The total number of marbles is three times the number of green marbles, so there are \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) marbles in total.

To find the number of marbles of a different color, we subtract the number of marbles that are of one of the four colors from the total:

\[ 180 - (20 \text{ (red)} + 60 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (yellow)}) \]
\[ = 180 - 92 \]
\[ = 88 \]

So, there are 88 marbles of a different color.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the box first. Let's denote the number of red marbles as \( R \), the number of green marbles as \( G \), the number of yellow marbles as \( Y \), and the number of marbles of a different color as \( D \). 

Given:
- \( R = 20 \)
- \( G = 3 \times R \)
- \( Y = 0.2 \times G \)
- \( R + G + Y + D = 3G \)

Let's calculate each part step by step:

1. **Calculate \( G \)**:
   \[
   G = 3 \times R = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

2. **Calculate \( Y \)**:
   \[
   Y = 0.2 \times G = 0.2 \times 60 = 12
   \]

3. **Use the equation for the total number of marbles**:
   \[
   R + G + Y + D = 3G
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   20 + 60 + 12 + D = 3 \times 60
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   20 + 60 + 12 + D = 180
   \]
   Combine the constants:
   \[
   92 + D = 180
   \]

4. **Solve for \( D \)**:
   \[
   D = 180 - 92 = 88
   \]

Therefore, the number of marbles of a different color is 88.

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1) We know that there are 20 red marbles.
2) There are three times more green marbles than red marbles, so there are \(3 \times 20 = 60\) green marbles.
3) Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles, so there are \(0.2 \times 60 = 12\) yellow marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles are of a different color. We know that the total number of marbles is three times the number of green marbles. Therefore, there are \(3 \times 60 = 180\) marbles in total.

Since we have 20 red, 60 green, and 12 yellow marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles of a different color by subtracting the total number of red, green, and yellow marbles from the total number of marbles:

Number of marbles of a different color = Total number of marbles - (Number of red + Number of green + Number of yellow)
= 180 - (20 + 60 + 12)
= 180 - 92
= 88

To determine the number of marbles of a different color, we need to first figure out how many marbles of each color there are and then use the given information about the total number of marbles.

1. **Number of Red Marbles**: There are 20 red marbles.
2. **Number of Green Marbles**: There are three times more green marbles than red marbles. Therefore, the number of green marbles is:
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
3. **Number of Yellow Marbles**: Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles. Therefore, the number of yellow marbles is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 60 = 12
   \]
4. **Total Number of Green Marbles**: Red, green, and yellow marbles make up the green marbles. Hence, the total number of green marbles in the box is:
   \[
   20 + 60 + 12 = 92
   \]
5. **Total Number of Marbles in the Box**: The problem states that the total number of marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:
   \[
   3 \times 92 = 276
   \]

Now, according to the total number of marbles given, let \( x \) be the number of marbles of a different color. The total number of marbles can be expressed as:
\[
20 \text{ (red)} + 60 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (yellow)} + x \text{ (different color)} = 276
\]
\[
20 + 60 + 12 + x = 276
\]
\[
92 + x = 276
\]
\[
x = 276 - 92
\]
\[
x = 184
\]

Thus, the number of marbles of a different color is:
\[
\boxed{184}

To find the total number of marbles in the box, we first calculate the number of green marbles. Given that there are three times more green marbles than red, we have:

\[ \text{Green marbles} = 3 \times \text{Red marbles} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow marbles, which make up 20% of the green marbles:

\[ \text{Yellow marbles} = 0.20 \times \text{Green marbles} = 0.20 \times 60 = 12 \]

The sum of the red, green, and yellow marbles gives us the total number of marbles in the box:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Red marbles} + \text{Green marbles} + \text{Yellow marbles} = 20 + 60 + 12 = 92 \]

Now, according to the problem, the total number of marbles in the box is three times the number of green marbles:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = 3 \times \text{Green marbles} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

However, we've calculated the total to be 92, which is not equal to 180, indicating an inconsistency. Let's consider the condition "the total of all marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles" again, interpreting it correctly as the total is three times the quantity of green marbles. This means we first determine the quantity of green marbles and then calculate:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = 3 \times \text{Green marbles} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Since the box contains 92 marbles, the condition "the total of all marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles" aligns with the actual total, meaning the quantity of green marbles (60) fits within the described total.

To find the number of marbles of a different color, we subtract the count of red, green, and yellow marbles from the total:

\[ \text{Marbles of a different color} = \text{Total marbles} - (\text{Red marbles} + \text{Green marbles} + \text{Yellow marbles}) = 92 - (20 + 60 + 12) \]
\[ = 92 - 92 = 0 \]

Therefore, the box contains 0 marbles of a different color.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the box and then find out how many marbles are not red.

1. **Identify the number of red marbles:**
   \[
   \text{Red marbles} = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the number of green marbles:**
   \[
   \text{Green marbles} = 3 \times \text{Red marbles} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Find the number of yellow marbles:**
   \[
   \text{Yellow marbles} = 20\% \text{ of Green marbles} = 0.20 \times 60 = 12
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of all marbles:**
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = \text{Red marbles} + \text{Green marbles} + \text{Yellow marbles} = 20 + 60 + 12 = 92
   \]

5. **Determine the number of marbles of a different color:**
   Since the total number of all marbles is three times the number of green marbles:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = 3 \times \text{Green marbles} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   This calculation seems incorrect since we already calculated the total as 92. It appears there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the situation:

   Given that the total number of marbles is three times the number of green marbles, we should use:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = 3 \times \text{Green marbles}
   \]
   \[
   92 = 3 \times \text{Green marbles}
   \]
   Solving for Green marbles:
   \[
   \text{Green marbles} = \frac{92}{3} \approx 30.67
   \]
   Since the number of marbles must be a whole number, let's re-check:
   \[
   \text{Green marbles} = 30
   \]
   This calculation is also incorrect. The correct total should be:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = 92
   \]
   
   Therefore, the number of marbles of a different color is:
   \[
   92 - 20 (red) - 60 (green) - 12 (yellow) = 50
   \]

Given that there are 3 times more green marbles than red marbles, and there are 20 red marbles, we can calculate the number of green marbles as:

Now, we know that yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles. So, the number of yellow marbles is:
\[ \text{Number of yellow marbles} = 0.2 \times G = 0.2 \times 60 = 12 \]

The total number of marbles in the box is three times the number of green marbles. So, the total number of marbles is:

To find the number of marbles that are of a different color, we subtract the number of red, green, and yellow marbles from the total number of marbles:
\[ \text{Number of marbles of a different color} = \text{Total marbles} - (\text{Red marbles} + \text{Green marbles} + \text{Yellow marbles}) \]

Given:
- There are 20 red marbles.
- There are three times more green marbles than red.
- Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles.
- The total number of marbles is three times more than the number of green marbles.

Let's denote:
- \( R = 20 \) (the number of red marbles) 
- \( G \) (the number of green marbles)
- \( Y \) (the number of yellow marbles)
- \( T \) (the total number of marbles)

First, we calculate the number of green marbles:
\[ G = 3 \times R = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow marbles, which is 20% of the green marbles:
\[ Y = 0.20 \times G = 0.20 \times 60 = 12 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of marbles:
\[ T = R + G + Y = 20 + 60 + 12 = 92 \]

According to the problem, the total number of marbles is three times more than the number of green marbles:
\[ T = 3 \times G \]
\[ 92 = 3 \times 60 \]

This confirms our total number of marbles is correct.

Now, to find the number of marbles of a different color:
The marbles of a different color are the ones that are not red, green, or yellow. They could be any other color (assuming there is only one other color described which is blue since it is not mentioned otherwise).

If there is only one other color, then all other marbles except the 86 (20 red + 60 green + 12 yellow) are of another color:
\[ \text{Number of marbles of a different color} = 36 - 86 = -50 \]
Because not all marbles could be different colors if there are fewer than 86 marbles of any other color.

To recheck and ensure accuracy:
If only blue is another color, then:
\[ \text{Number of marbles of a different color} = 36 - 86 = -50 \]
This implies zero other colors making up 36 of the total.

Therefore:
\[ \text{Number of marbles of a different color} = 36 - 86 = -50 \]

This indicates total red, green, and yellow marbles. 

The answer is: 36 - 86 = -50

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of marbles of each color and the total number of marbles in the box. We'll start by defining variables for the number of each color of marble and then using the given relationships to solve for the unknown quantities.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be the number of red marbles.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of green marbles.
   - Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow marbles.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blue marbles.

2. **Given information:**
   - There are 20 red marbles: \( R = 20 \).
   - There are three times more green marbles than red: \( G = 3R \).
   - Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles: \( Y = 0.2G \).
   - The total number of marbles is three times more than the number of green marbles: \( R + G + Y + B = 3G \).

3. **Calculate the number of green marbles:**
   - Substitute \( R \) into the equation for \( G \):
     \[
     G = 3R = 3 \times 20 = 60
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of yellow marbles:**
   - Substitute \( G \) into the equation for \( Y \):
     \[
     Y = 0.2G = 0.2 \times 60 = 12
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of marbles:**
   - Substitute \( G \) into the equation for the total number of marbles:
     \[
     R + G + Y + B = 3G \implies 20 + 60 + 12 + B = 3 \times 60 \implies 20 + 60 + 12 + B = 180 \implies 92 + B = 180 \implies B = 88
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of marbles of a different color if the total of all marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles:**
   - The total number of marbles is 180, which is three times the number of green marbles:
     \[
     3G = 3 \times 60 = 180
     \]
   - Since the total number of marbles is 180 and we already have 20 red, 60 green, and 12 yellow marbles, the remaining number of marbles is:
     \[
     B + R = 88 + 20 = 108
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of marbles of a different color is:
     \[
     20 \text{ (red)} + 60 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (yellow)} + (180 - 92 - 108) = 20 + 60 + 12 + 92 + 108 = 382

We need to find the number of marbles of different colors. To do this, we first calculate the number of each color of marble in reference to the total marbles in the box. 

Let's denote the total number of marbles as \( T \).

We know that there are 20 red marbles. There are three times more green marbles than red, so there are \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) green marbles.

The yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles, which means there are \( 0.20 \times 60 = 12 \) yellow marbles.

The total number of marbles in the box is three times the number of green marbles, which gives us \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) marbles in total.

We already know there are 20 red, 60 green, and 12 yellow marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles counted is \( 20 + 60 + 12 = 92 \).

Since there are 180 marbles in total, the number of marbles of a different color is \( 180 - 92 = 88 \).

Let's denote the number of green marbles as \( G \). According to the information given, there are three times more green marbles than red marbles. Since there are 20 red marbles, the number of green marbles is \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \).

Next, we know that yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles. So, the number of yellow marbles is \( 0.2 \times G = 0.2 \times 60 = 12 \).

Now, we know the total number of green and yellow marbles is \( 60 + 12 = 72 \).

The total number of marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles. So, the total number of marbles is \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

Since we already count the number of green and yellow marbles, the remaining marbles, which have a different color, is \( 180 - 72 = 108 \).
