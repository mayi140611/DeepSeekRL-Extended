#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
To find the total length of all of Christina's snakes combined, we need to add the lengths of each snake: 

1. 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches for the 2-foot long snake
2. 16 inches for the first snake
3. 10 inches for the last snake

Now we can add them all together: 

24 inches + 16 inches + 10 inches = 50 inches

Therefore, all of her snakes combined are 50 inches long.

Christina has snakes that are 2 feet, 16 inches, and 10 inches long. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 2 feet is equal to 24 inches. 

16 inches is the length of the other snake in inches.
10 inches is the length of the last snake in inches.

To find the total length, we add all the lengths together:
24 inches (first snake) + 16 inches (second snake in inches) + 10 inches (last snake) = 40 inches

1 snake is 2 feet long and there are 12 inches in a foot, so the first snake is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.
The second snake is 16 inches long.
The third snake is 10 inches long.

To find the total length of all the snakes combined, we need to add up the lengths of the three snakes. So the total length is 24 inches + 16 inches + 10 inches = 50 inches.

First, we need to convert the length of the second snake from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 16 inches is equal to 16/12 feet. The third snake is already given in inches, so it remains 10 inches.

Next, we add the lengths of all the snakes together:
- The first snake is 2 feet long.
- The second snake is 16 inches long, which is 16/12 feet.
- The third snake is 10 inches long, which is 10/12 feet.

To add these together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator between feet and inches is 12. We can convert 2 feet to inches first:
- 2 feet = 2 x 12 inches = 24 inches.

Now we can add all the lengths:
- 24 inches (first snake) + (16 inches / 12 feet) + (10 inches / 12 feet) = 24 + 16/12 + 10/12 = 34/12 feet.

Finally, we can convert the total length back to inches by multiplying by 12:
- 34/12 feet * 12 inches/foot = 34 inches.

To find the total length of all the snakes combined, we first need to ensure that all measurements are in the same unit. Since inches are commonly used, we will convert the length of the first snake from feet to inches.

1 snake is 2 feet long. There are 12 inches in a foot.

2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches

Now we can add the lengths of all the snakes:

First snake: 24 inches
Second snake: 16 inches
Third snake: 10 inches

24 + 16 + 10 = 50 inches

The total length of all of her snakes combined is 50 inches.
