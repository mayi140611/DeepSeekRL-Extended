To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cows on the farm. We know that on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. 

First, let's find out how many liters of milk 1 cow produces in one week. We can calculate this by dividing the total liters of milk by the number of cows and then dividing by the number of weeks:
\[ \text{Liters produced by 1 cow per week} = \frac{108}{6 \times 5} = \frac{108}{30} = 3.6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, to find out how many cows are on the farm, we need to know the total number of weeks the cows produced milk. This is given as 5 weeks. Now, we can calculate the total number of liters of milk produced by all the cows:
\[ \text{Total liters of milk produced by 1 cow in 5 weeks} = 3.6 \times 5 = 18 \text{ liters} \]

Since we know that the total number of liters of milk produced by all the cows in 5 weeks is 2160 liters, we can calculate the total number of cows on the farm by dividing the total liters of milk by the liters produced by 1 cow in 5 weeks:
\[ \text{Total number of cows} = \frac{2160}{18} = 120 \]

Therefore, the farm has 120 cows.

Let's denote the number of cows on the farm as \( x \).

From the information given, we know that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. That means 1 cow produces \( \frac{108}{6} = 18 \) liters of milk per week.

In five weeks, the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. If each cow produces \( 18 \) liters per week, then \( x \) cows will produce \( 18x \) liters per week.

So in five weeks, \( x \) cows will produce \( 18x \times 5 \) liters of milk.

Therefore, we have the equation \( 18x \times 5 = 2160 \).

Simplifying this equation, we get \( 90x = 2160 \), and thus \( x = \frac{2160}{90} = 24 \).

So, the farm has 24 cows.

Let's start by determining the number of cows that produce 108 liters of milk per week. We know that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. So, the number of cows required to produce 108 liters per week is 6. To find out how many cows are needed to produce 2160 liters in five weeks, we need to multiply the weekly milk production by the number of weeks and then divide by the weekly milk production per cow.

First, we find the milk production rate per cow. Since 6 cows produce 108 liters per week, one cow produces \( \frac{108}{6} = 18 \) liters per week. Now, if 18 liters are produced by one cow per week, then five cows would produce \( 5 \times 18 = 90 \) liters per week. To find the total number of cows, we divide the total milk produced by the weekly production of the cows:

\[ 2160 \, \text{liters} \div 90 \, \text{liters per week} = 24 \, \text{cows} \]

So, there are 24 cows on the farm.

To determine the number of cows on the farm, we can start by calculating the average milk production per cow per week. Given that 6 cows together produce 108 liters of milk per week, each cow produces:
\[ \frac{108}{6} = 18 \text{ liters of milk per week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much milk each cow produces in five weeks:
\[ 18 \text{ liters/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 90 \text{ liters of milk per cow in 5 weeks} \]

Since the total milk produced in five weeks by all cows was 2160 liters, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of cows:
\[ \text{Number of cows} \times 90 = 2160 \]

Solving for the number of cows:
\[ \text{Number of cows} = \frac{2160}{90} = 24 \]

Thus, there are 24 cows on the farm.

To determine the number of cows on the farm, we start by finding out how many liters of milk a single cow produces per week on average. Since every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we can calculate the milk produced by one cow per week as follows:
\[ \text{Milk per cow per week} = \frac{108}{6} = 18 \text{ liters} \]

Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we can find the total milk produced by all cows in five weeks by multiplying the weekly milk production per cow by 5:
\[ \text{Total milk in 5 weeks} = 5 \times 18 = 90 \text{ liters per cow in 5 weeks} \]

Now, we can use the total milk produced in 5 weeks to find the number of cows:
\[ \text{Number of cows} = \frac{\text{Total milk in 5 weeks}}{\text{Milk per cow in 5 weeks}} = \frac{2160}{90} = 24 \]

Therefore, there are 24 cows on the farm.

Let's denote the number of cows on the farm as \( n \). According to the problem, every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. Therefore, the number of 6-cows groups in the total milk produced per week is \( \frac{2160}{108} = 20 \). This means there are 20 groups of 6 cows.

So, the total number of cows \( n \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ n = \frac{20 \times 6}{1} = 120 \]

Thus, there are 120 cows on the farm.

Given that 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we can find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per week by dividing 108 by 6:

108 liters / 6 = 18 liters per week

Now, knowing one cow produces 18 liters of milk per week, we can calculate the total amount of milk produced by 1 cow in five weeks:

18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters

If the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we can determine how many cows there are on the farm by dividing the total milk produced by the milk produced by one cow in the same period:

2160 liters / 90 liters/cow = 24 cows

Therefore, there are 24 cows on the farm.

Let's denote the number of cows on the farm as \( C \).

From the information given, we know that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. Therefore, the milk produced by one cow per week is:
\[
\frac{108}{6} = 18 \text{ liters}
\]

In five weeks, the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. Therefore, the total milk produced per week by all the cows can be calculated as:
\[
2160 \text{ liters} \div 5 \text{ weeks} = 432 \text{ liters per week}
\]

Since each cow produces 18 liters of milk per week, the total number of cows \( C \) can be calculated by dividing the total milk produced per week by the milk produced by each cow per week:
\[
C = \frac{432 \text{ liters per week}}{18 \text{ liters per cow}} = 24 \text{ cows}

To determine the number of cows on the farm, we need to calculate the total amount of milk produced by all cows in five weeks. Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, the production rate per cow per week can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Milk production per cow per week} = \frac{108 \text{ liters}}{6 \text{ cows}} = 18 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we know that the total milk produced in five weeks is 2160 liters. To find out how many cows are on the farm, we need to first determine the total amount of milk produced by all the cows in five weeks. Since the total milk produced is 2160 liters, the multiplication for the total production over five weeks is:

\[ \text{Total milk production in five weeks} = \text{Total production by cows per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} \]

\[ 2160 \text{ liters} = 18 \text{ liters/cow/week} \times 30 \text{ weeks} \]

We can now solve for the number of cows on the farm. Given that 30 weeks have passed, we have:

\[ \text{Number of cows} = \frac{\text{Total milk production}}{\text{Total milk production per cow}} \]

\[ \text{Number of cows} = \frac{2160 \text{ liters}}{18 \text{ liters/cow}} = 120 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farm has 120 cows in total.

To solve this problem, we can use the information given about the average milk production per cow. First, let's determine how many liters of milk a single cow produces in a week.

Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we can calculate the amount of milk produced by a single cow per week as follows:
\[ \text{Milk per cow per week} = \frac{108 \text{ liters}}{6 \text{ cows}} = 18 \text{ liters per cow per week} \]

Next, we know the farm produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks. We can find the weekly milk production rate of the farm by dividing the total milk production by the number of weeks:
\[ \text{Weekly milk production rate} = \frac{2160 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ weeks}} = 432 \text{ liters per week} \]

Now, we can find out how many cows there are by dividing the total weekly milk production by the milk production rate per cow:
\[ \text{Number of cows} = \frac{432 \text{ liters per week}}{18 \text{ liters per cow}} = 24 \text{ cows} \]

To solve this problem, we first need to establish the total milk production rate for the cows. Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we can calculate the rate for one cow per week. 

\[ \text{Milk production per week for 6 cows} = 108 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Milk production per week for 1 cow} = \frac{108}{6} = 18 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we know that in five weeks, the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. We can use this information to find out how much milk one cow produces in five weeks:

\[ \text{Milk produced by 1 cow in 5 weeks} = 18 \times 5 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of cows \( C \) on the farm by dividing the total milk produced by 5 weeks by the milk produced by one cow in those 5 weeks:

First, we need to find out how many liters of milk cows produce per week on average. We do this by dividing the total amount of milk produced in five weeks by 5: 

\( \frac{2160\ \text{liters}}{5\ \text{weeks}} = 432\ \text{liters per week}\)

Next, we need to find out how many cows produce 432 liters of milk per week since we know that 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. So, by dividing the weekly amount produced by 6, we find:

\( \frac{432\ \text{liters per week}}{6\ \text{cows}} = 72\ \text{cows per week}\)

Finally, to find the total number of cows, we divide the weekly amount by the weekly amount per cow:

\( \frac{72\ \text{cows per week}}{1}\ = 72 \)

Therefore, there are 72 cows on the farm.

To find the number of cows on the farm, we can use the information given to set up a proportion. The problem states that each group of 6 cows produces 108 liters of milk per week. Over five weeks, the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. 

First, let's find the total amount of milk produced by 6 cows over five weeks:
\[ 108 \text{ liters/cow/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 540 \text{ liters/cow} \]

Now, to find out how many cows are on the farm, we divide the total milk produced (2160 liters) by the milk produced by 6 cows in the same period:

We know that each cow produces the same amount of milk over the same period of time. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cows by dividing the total amount of milk by the amount of milk produced per cow. In this case, each cow produces 108 liters of milk per week, and there is a five week period mentioned. We can calculate the total milk produced by multiplying the amount produced per cow by the number of weeks:

Total milk produced = Milk produced per cow per week * Number of weeks
Total milk produced = 108 * 5 = 540 liters

Now we can find out the number of cows by dividing the total milk by the amount produced by each cow:

Number of cows = Total milk produced / Milk produced per cow
Number of cows = 540 / 108 = 5 cows

Therefore, the farm has 5 cows.

Let's start by finding out how much milk a single cow produces in a week. If 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, then each cow produces \( \frac{108}{6} = 18 \) liters of milk per week.

Next, we need to determine how much milk is produced by 18 cows in five weeks. Since 18 cows produce 18 liters each week, together they produce \( 18 \times 5 = 90 \) liters of milk per week.

Given that the total milk produced in five weeks is 2160 liters, we can find the number of cows by dividing this total by the weekly milk production of a group of 18 cows. Thus, the total number of cows is \( \frac{2160}{90} \).
