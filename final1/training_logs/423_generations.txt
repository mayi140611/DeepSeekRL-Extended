#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Initial amount of rice = 10 kg. Amount cooked in the morning = \(\frac{9}{10}\) kg. Remaining rice after morning = \(10 - \frac{9}{10}\) kg. Amount cooked in the evening = \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining in the morning, so remaining = \(10 - \frac{9}{10} - \frac{1}{4}(10 - \frac{9}{10})\). Total remaining rice = 10 - \(\frac{9}{10}\) - \(\frac{1}{4}\)(10 - \(\frac{9}{10}\)) = 7.5 kg. 7.5 kg = 7500 g. Thus, she had 7500 grams of rice left.

Rose initially had 10 kilograms of rice. She cooked 9/10 kilograms in the morning, so the remaining rice after the morning is:

\[ 10 - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{100}{10} - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{91}{10} = 9.1 \text{ kilograms} \]

In the evening, she cooked 1/4 of the remaining 9.1 kilograms. So the amount cooked in the evening is:

\[ \frac{9.1}{4} = 2.275 \text{ kilograms} \]

The amount of rice left after the evening is:

\[ 9.1 - 2.275 = 6.825 \text{ kilograms} \]

Since we need the answer in grams, we convert kilograms to grams by multiplying by 1000:

\[ 6.825 \times 1000 = 6825 \text{ grams} \]

At the beginning, Rosy had 10 kg of rice. In the morning, she cooked 9/10 * 10 = 9 kg of rice. So she was left with 10 - 9 = 1 kg of rice. In the evening, she cooked 1/4 * 1 = 0.25 kg of rice. So, she was left with 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 kg of rice. Therefore, rose has 0.75 * 1000 = 750 grams of rice left.

Initially, Rose had 10 kilograms of rice. She cooked 9/10 kilograms in the morning, leaving her with:

\[ 10 - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{100}{10} - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{91}{10} \text{ kilograms} \]

In the evening, she cooked 1/4 of the remaining amount. The amount cooked in the evening is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{91}{10} = \frac{91}{40} \text{ kilograms} \]

Subtract this from the remaining amount:

\[ \frac{91}{10} - \frac{91}{40} = \frac{364}{40} - \frac{91}{40} = \frac{273}{40} \text{ kilograms} \]

To convert kilograms to grams (1 kilogram = 1000 grams):

\[ \frac{273}{40} \times 1000 = \frac{273}{40} \times 1000 = 6825 \text{ grams} \]

To determine how much rice Rose has left, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Weight of Rice:**
   Rose starts with 10 kilograms of rice. We need to convert this weight into grams because the answer is asked in grams.

   \[
   10 \text{ kg} = 10 \times 1000 \text{ g} = 10,000 \text{ g}
   \]

2. **Rice Cooked in the Morning:**
   Rose cooked \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms of rice in the morning.

   \[
   \frac{9}{10} \text{ kg} = \frac{9}{10} \times 1000 \text{ g} = 900 \text{ g}
   \]

3. **Remaining Rice After Morning Cooking:**
   Subtract the rice cooked in the morning from the initial amount.

   \[
   10,000 \text{ g} - 900 \text{ g} = 9,100 \text{ g}
   \]

4. **Rice Cooked in the Evening:**
   Rose cooked \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice in the evening.

   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 9,100 \text{ g} = 2,275 \text{ g}
   \]

5. **Remaining Rice After Evening Cooking:**
   Subtract the rice cooked in the evening from the remaining rice after morning cooking.

   \[
   9,100 \text{ g} - 2,275 \text{ g} = 6,825 \text{ g}
   \]

Therefore, Rose has 6,825 grams of rice left.

To solve this, first, we need to calculate the amount of rice Rose cooked in the morning. She cooked 9/10 of the 10 kilograms:

\( 10 \text{ kg} \times \frac{9}{10} = 9 \text{ kg} \)

After cooking in the morning, the remaining rice is:

\( 10 \text{ kg} - 9 \text{ kg} = 1 \text{ kg} \)

In the evening, she cooked 1/4 of the remaining 1 kg:

\( 1 \text{ kg} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ kg} \)

This is equal to 0.25 kg or 250 grams.

Now, we subtract the evening's cooking from the remaining rice:

\( 1 \text{ kg} - 250 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} - 250 \text{ grams} = 750 \text{ grams} \)

So, Rose had 750 grams of rice left.

To find out how many grams of rice Rose had left, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of rice used in the morning:**
   Rose cooked \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms of rice in the morning.

2. **Calculate the remaining rice after the morning:**
   - Initial amount of rice: 10 kilograms
   - Amount used in the morning: \( 10 \times \frac{9}{10} = 9 \) kilograms
   - Remaining rice after morning: \( 10 - 9 = 1 \) kilogram

3. **Calculate the amount used in the evening:**
   Rose used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining 1 kilogram in the evening.

4. **Calculate the remaining rice after the evening:**
   - Amount used in the evening: \( 1 \times \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \) kilograms
   - Remaining rice after evening: \( 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \) kilograms

5. **Convert the remaining rice to grams:**
   Since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, we convert the remaining rice from kilograms to grams:
   \( 0.75 \) kilograms \( \times 1000 = 750 \) grams

**Therefore, the amount of rice Rose had left is 750 grams.**

To find out how many grams of rice Rose had left, we first need to calculate the amount of rice she cooked and then subtract it from her initial amount. 

1. Rose cooked 9/10 kilograms in the morning. To find this in grams, we multiply by 1000 (since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram):
   \[
   9/10 \text{ kg} \times 1000 = 900 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. Rose had 10 kg of rice in total, and after cooking 900 grams, the remaining amount of rice in kilograms is:
   \[
   10 \text{ kg} - 900 \text{ grams} = 10 \text{ kg} - 0.9 \text{ kg} = 9.1 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. The next step is to calculate how much rice she cooked in the evening, which is 1/4 of the remaining rice:
   \[
   1/4 \text{ of } 9.1 \text{ kg} = 2.275 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. Convert this back to grams:
   \[
   2.275 \text{ kg} \times 1000 = 2275 \text{ grams}
   \]

5. Finally, to find the remaining rice, we subtract the amount cooked in the morning and the evening from the initial amount:
   \[
   10 \text{ kg} - 900 \text{ grams} - 2275 \text{ grams} = 10 \text{ kg} - 3175 \text{ grams}
   \]

6. Convert back to grams:
   \[
   3175 \text{ grams}
   \]

7. Finally, to convert grams into grams (since the answer requested is in grams):
   \[
   10 \text{ kg} - 3175 \text{ grams} = 10000 \text{ grams} - 3175 \text{ grams} = 6825 \text{ grams}
   \]

Let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Rose started with 10 kilograms of rice.
2. In the morning, she cooked 9/10 kilograms. So, the amount left after the morning is:
   \(10 - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{100}{10} - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{91}{10}\) kilograms.
3. In the evening, she cooked 1/4 of the remaining 91/10 kilograms. So, the amount cooked in the evening is:
   \(\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{91}{10} = \frac{91}{40}\) kilograms.
4. The amount left after the evening is:
   \(\frac{91}{10} - \frac{91}{40} = \frac{364}{40} - \frac{91}{40} = \frac{273}{40}\) kilograms.

To convert this to grams:

Let's calculate the remaining rice step by step.

1. Initially, Rose had 10 kilograms of rice.
2. In the morning, she cooked \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms of rice.
   - Remaining rice after morning = \( 10 - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{100}{10} - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{91}{10} \) kilograms.
3. In the evening, she cooked \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice.
   - Rice cooked in the evening = \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{91}{10} = \frac{91}{40} \) kilograms.
   - Remaining rice after evening = \( \frac{91}{10} - \frac{91}{40} \).

Let's calculate the remaining rice after the evening:

- First, find a common denominator for the fractions:
  \( \frac{91}{10} \) and \( \frac{91}{40} \) both have a denominator of 40.
- Convert \( \frac{91}{10} \) to a fraction with denominator 40:
  \( \frac{91}{10} = \frac{91 \times 4}{10 \times 4} = \frac{364}{40} \).
- Now, subtract the fraction:
  \( \frac{364}{40} - \frac{91}{40} = \frac{364 - 91}{40} = \frac{273}{40} \) kilograms.

So, Rose has \( \frac{273}{40} \) kilograms of rice left.

To convert this to grams:
- There are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram.
- Therefore, \( \frac{273}{40} \) kilograms is equal to \( \frac{273 \times 1000}{40} = \frac{273000}{40} = 6825 \) grams.

So, Rose had \( 6825 \) grams of rice left.

To find out how many grams of rice Rose had left, we first need to calculate how much she cooked in the morning and then determine how much rice she had left afterwards.

Rose cooked \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms in the morning, which is 900 grams (since 1 kilogram = 1000 grams). So she had \( 10\, \text{kg} - 900\, \text{g} = 10000\, \text{g} - 900\, \text{g} = 9100\, \text{g} \) left after the morning cooking.

Then she cooked \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice in the evening. So she cooked \( \frac{1}{4} \times 9100\, \text{g} = 2275\, \text{g} \). 

Therefore, the rice left after the evening cooking is \( 9100\, \text{g} - 2275\, \text{g} = 6825\, \text{g} \).

So, Rose had 6825 grams of rice left.

To determine how many grams of rice Rose had left, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial amount of rice**: Rose started with 10 kilograms of rice.
2. **Rice cooked in the morning**: Rose cooked \(\frac{9}{10}\) kilograms of rice in the morning. This means she had \(10 - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{90}{10} - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{81}{10} = 8.1\) kilograms of rice left.
3. **Rice cooked in the evening**: Rose cooked \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining 8.1 kilograms in the evening. So, she cooked \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8.1 = 2.025\) kilograms of rice. The remaining rice is \(8.1 - 2.025 = 6.075\) kilograms.
4. **Convert kilograms to grams**: Since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, we convert 6.075 kilograms to grams. This gives us \(6.075 \times 1000 = 6075\) grams.

Therefore, the amount of rice Rose had left is **6075 grams**.
