#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Jackson has missed \(36 - 1 - 2 = 33\) Wednesdays and 2 Fridays for the school year.

Total sandwich meals for Wednesdays = \(36 - 1 = 35\)
Total sandwich meals for Fridays = \(36 - 2 = 34\)

Total sandwiches eaten = \(35 + 34 = 69\)

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####

system
Jackson's school has 36 weeks of school. There are 2 days missed per week (one Wednesday and one Friday), so the total number of missed days is 2 * 36 = 72 days.

Since a sandwich is packed for lunch on Wednesdays and Fridays, he missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays, resulting in 1 + 2 = 3 Wednesdays missed and 2 Fridays missed.

For each school week, the total number of sandwiches he gets for lunch is 72 days, minus the number of missed days (3 plus 2), giving 72 - (3 + 2) = 67 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in a year.

Therefore, the answer is 67.

Jackson's mom packs him a total of 4 sandwiches a week (3 on Wednesdays and 1 on Fridays). There are 36 weeks of school.

First, calculate the total possible sandwiches:
4 sandwiches/week * 36 weeks = 144 sandwiches.

Then, subtract the missed sandwiches:
144 sandwiches - (1 missed Wednesday + 2 missed Fridays) = 144 - 3 sandwiches = 141 sandwiches.

So, Jackson ate 141 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches this school year.

To determine the total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate this school year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays in a school year.
2. Adjust the numbers based on the missed days.
3. Sum the adjusted numbers to find the total number of sandwiches Jackson ate.

First, let's calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays in a school year. There are 36 weeks of school, and Jackson eats a sandwich every Wednesday and every Friday. So, there are:
\[ 36 \text{ Wednesdays} + 36 \text{ Fridays} = 72 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to adjust for the days Jackson missed. Jackson missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays. So, the number of Wednesdays he ate is:
\[ 36 - 1 = 35 \]
The number of Fridays he ate is:
\[ 36 - 2 = 34 \]

Now, we sum the adjusted numbers to find the total number of sandwiches Jackson ate this school year:
\[ 35 \text{ Wednesdays} + 34 \text{ Fridays} = 69 \]

Therefore, the total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate this school year is:
\[ \boxed{69} \]

To calculate how many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate this school year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of Wednesdays and Fridays in a year:**
   - There are 36 weeks of school.
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, there are \(36 / 4 = 9\) months in a year.
   - Each month has 4 Wednesdays and 5 Fridays.

2. **Calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays across all months:**
   - Monday to Wednesday: \(4 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ months} = 36 \text{ Wednesdays}\)
   - Thursday to Saturday: \(5 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ months} = 45 \text{ Fridays}\)
   - Total days: \(36 + 45 = 81 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ months}\)

3. **Account for the missed days:**
   - Jackson missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays.
   - Therefore, he ate \(10 - 1 - 2 = 7\) Wednesdays and \(8 - 2 = 6\) Fridays.

4. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches:**
   - Jackson eats 2 sandwiches per week.
   - Total sandwiches for Wednesdays: \(7 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sandwiches/week} = 14 \text{ sandwiches}\)
   - Total sandwiches for Fridays: \(6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sandwiches/week} = 12 \text{ sandwiches}\)

5. **Sum the total number of sandwiches:**
   - Total sandwiches: \(14 \text{ sandwiches} + 12 \text{ sandwiches} = 26 \text{ sandwiches}\)

**Answer:**
Jackson ate a total of 26 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch this school year.

In a year with 36 weeks, there are traditionally 2*36=72 school days. Jackson has missed 1 Wednesday plus 2 Fridays, totaling 1+2=3 days of school. Thus, he would have eaten 72-3=69 sandwiches.

Jackson has school from Wednesday to Friday, so he has 4 school days per week.

There are 36 weeks of school, so Jackson would have eaten 36 weeks * 4 days = 144 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches if he had attended every Wednesday and Friday.

However, he has missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays, which means he has missed 3 days.

So, the total number of sandwiches he ate is 144 - 3 = 141.

To determine how many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate this school year, we need to calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays he attended.

1. Calculate the total number of Wednesdays he attended:
   - There are 36 weeks in the school year.
   - He missed 1 Wednesday.
   - Therefore, he attended 36 - 1 = 35 Wednesdays.

2. Calculate the total number of Fridays he attended:
   - He missed 2 Fridays.
   - Therefore, he attended 36 - 2 = 34 Fridays.

3. Calculate the total number of sandwiches he ate:
   - He eats one sandwich per Wednesday.
   - He eats one sandwich per Friday.
   - Therefore, the total number of sandwiches is 35 Wednesdays + 34 Fridays = 69 sandwiches.

There are 36 weeks of school, and each week has 2 Wednesdays and 2 Fridays for sandwiches. This means there are 2 * 36 = 72 Wednesdays and 2 * 36 = 72 Fridays.

Jackson has missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays, so he attended 72 - 1 - 2 = 69 Wednesdays and 72 - 2 = 70 Fridays.

The total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches eaten for lunch this school year is 69 * 1 + 70 * 1 = 139.

Jackson's mom packed him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on Wednesdays and Fridays.

So for the entire school year, he would have had:
- Wednesdays: 36 weeks / 3 weeks per sandwich = 12 sandwiches
- Fridays: 36 weeks / 2 weeks per sandwich = 18 sandwiches

Since he missed 3 Wednesdays and 2 Fridays, the total missed days are:
- Wednesdays: 3
- Fridays: 2

Total missed sandwiches = 3 (Wednesdays) + 2 (Fridays) = 5

Total sandwiches eaten:
12 (Wednesdays he actually had) + 18 (Fridays he actually had) - 5 (missed sandwiches) = 25 sandwiches

To determine how many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays in a school year.
2. Determine how many Wednesdays and Fridays Jackson attended given the number of days he missed.

First, in a school year, there are 36 Wednesdays and 36 Fridays, which totals 72 school days.

Jackson missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays, so he attended \(72 - 1 - 2 = 69\) weeks of school.

Since Jackson packs a sandwich for every school day, he ate 69 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch this school year.

Jackson's mom packs him breakfast 5 school days a week, so in a 36-week school year, 36 * 5 = 180 sandwiches are made for him.

Jared has missed 1 Wednesday and Friday so he did lunches on 36 - 1- 2 = 33 days where he had the peanut butter and jelly sandwich made.

Jackson’s mom packs him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for his school lunch on Wednesdays and Fridays. There are 36 weeks of school and Jackson has only missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays, meaning he ate the lunch on each of those days.

Let's calculate the total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches he ate:

- Wednesdays: 36 weeks - 1 missed Wednesday = 35 days of eating
- Fridays: 36 weeks - 2 missed Fridays = 34 days of eating

For Wednesdays: 
35 days * 1 sandwich = 35 sandwiches

For Fridays:
34 days * 1 sandwich = 34 sandwiches

Total:
35 sandwiches (Wednesdays) + 34 sandwiches (Fridays) = 69 sandwiches

Therefore, he ate 69 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch this school year.
