Let's start by determining the number of paperback and hardback books Sarah bought. According to the problem, Sarah bought 6 paperback books and 4 hardback books. 

Her brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah, which means he bought $6/3 = 2$ paperback books. 

Additionally, he bought two times the number of hardback books that Sarah bought, so he bought $4 \times 2 = 8$ hardback books.

To find the total number of books her brother bought, we add the paperback and hardback books together: $2 + 8 = 10$.

To determine the total number of books that Sarah's brother bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of book he purchased based on the given information.

First, let's find out how many paperback books Sarah's brother bought. Since he bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah bought, we can calculate this as follows:
Number of paperback books bought by Sarah's brother = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

Next, we'll determine the number of hardback books that Sarah's brother bought. He bought two times the number of hardback books that Sarah bought, so:
Number of hardback books bought by Sarah's brother = \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \)

Now, we can find the total number of books bought by Sarah's brother by adding the number of paperback and hardback books he purchased:
Total number of books bought by Sarah's brother = \( 2 + 8 = 10 \)

Therefore, Sarah's brother bought a total of 10 books.

First, we calculate how many paperback books Sarah's brother bought. Since Sarah bought 6 paperback books, her brother bought one-third as many:

\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ paperback books} \]

Next, we calculate how many hardback books Sarah's brother bought. She bought 4 hardback books, so her brother bought two times that amount:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ hardback books} \]

Now we add the number of paperback books her brother bought to the number of hardback books:

\[ 2 + 8 = 10 \text{ books in total} \]

Therefore, Sarah's brother bought 10 books in total.

   - Sarah bought 6 paperback books.
   - Her brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah.
   - Calculation:

First, let's determine the number of paperback and hardback books Sarah bought:
- Sarah bought 6 paperback books.
- Sarah bought 4 hardback books.

Next, we need to find out how many paperback books Sarah's brother bought. We know that Sarah's brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah:
- One-third of 6 paperback books is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) paperback books.

Then, we need to determine how many hardback books Sarah's brother bought. We know that Sarah's brother bought two times the number of hardback books that Sarah bought:
- Two times 4 hardback books is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) hardback books.

Now we can sum the total number of books that Sarah's brother bought:
- Sarah's brother bought 2 paperback books and 8 hardback books.
- Total number of books = \( 2 + 8 = 10 \) books.

Therefore, Sarah's brother bought a total of 10 books.

To determine the total number of books Sarah's brother bought, we first need to calculate the quantities of each type of book that he bought.

1. **Paperback Books:**
   - Sarah bought 6 paperback books.
   - Her brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah.
   \[
   \text{Number of paperback books bought by brother} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
   \]

2. **Hardback Books:**
   - Sarah bought 4 hardback books.
   - Her brother bought two times the number of hardback books that Sarah bought.
   \[
   \text{Number of hardback books bought by brother} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Total Books:**
   - Now that we have the quantities of both types of books, we can find the total number of books bought by both Sarah and her brother.
   \[
   \text{Total books} = (\text{Number of paperback books bought by Sarah} + \text{Number of paperback books bought by brother}) + (\text{Number of hardback books bought by Sarah} + \text{Number of hardback books bought by brother})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total books} = (6 + 2) + (4 + 8) = 8 + 12 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Sarah's brother bought 20 books in total.
