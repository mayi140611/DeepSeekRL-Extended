To determine the total number of trash cans the town has paid for, let's follow these steps:

1. The town paid for adding 14 trash cans to the streets.
2. The council also paid for adding twice as many trash cans to the back of stores as to the streets. 
   - Twice as many trash cans as on the streets would be \(2 \times 14 = 28\).
3. To find the total number of trash cans, we add the number of trash cans on the streets to the number of trash cans in the back of stores:
   - Total trash cans = trash cans on streets + trash cans in back of stores
   - Total trash cans = 14 + 28

Therefore, the total number of trash cans the town has paid for is 42.

To determine the total number of trash cans the town has paid for, let's break it down step by step.

1. The council pays for adding 14 trash cans to the streets.
2. Additionally, they pay for adding twice as many trash cans to the back of stores as there are on the streets. Since there are 14 trash cans on the streets, twice that number would be \(2 \times 14 = 28\) trash cans.
3. Therefore, the total number of trash cans the town has paid for is the sum of the trash cans on the streets and the trash cans at the stores:
   \[
   14 \text{ (streets)} + 28 \text{ (stores)} = 42 \text{ trash cans}
   \]

The town has paid for 14 trash cans plus twice the number of those, which is 14 plus 2*14 trash cans. 

Calculation:
14 trash cans + (2 * 14 trash cans) = 

14 + 28 = 42 trash cans

So the town has paid for 42 trash cans.

system
To determine the total number of trash cans the town has paid for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trash cans added to the streets.
2. Calculate the number of trash cans added to the back of stores, which is twice the number of trash cans added to the streets.
3. Add the two quantities together to get the total number of trash cans.

Let's break it down:

1. The council pays for 14 trash cans to be added to the streets.
2. The number of trash cans added to the back of stores is twice the number of trash cans added to the streets, which is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) trash cans.
3. The total number of trash cans is the sum of the trash cans added to the streets and the trash cans added to the back of stores, which is \(14 + 28 = 42\).

Therefore, the town has paid for 42 trash cans.

To determine the total number of trash cans the town has paid for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trash cans added to the streets.
2. Determine the number of trash cans added to the back of stores.
3. Sum the two quantities to get the total number of trash cans.

Step 1: The town has added 14 trash cans to the streets.

Step 2: The town has added twice as many trash cans to the back of stores. Since the number of trash cans added to the streets is 14, the number of trash cans added to the back of stores is:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]

Step 3: Now, we add the number of trash cans from the streets and the back of stores to get the total number of trash cans:
\[ 14 + 28 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of trash cans the town has paid for is 42.

system
The town has paid for 14 trash cans plus twice as many trash cans to the back of stores. If we assume that one store has twice as many trash cans as one street trash can, we can calculate it as follows:

First, calculate the number of trash cans to the back of stores:
2 * 14 = 28 trash cans

Next, add the number of trash cans to the streets to the number of trash cans to the back of stores. Since we assume one store has twice as many trash cans as one street trash can:
14 (from the streets) + 28 (from the stores) = 42 trash cans in total.

To find out the total number of trash cans the town has paid for, we need to add the number of trash cans to the streets to the number of trash cans added to the back of the stores.

The town paid for adding 14 trash cans to the streets.
They also paid for adding twice as many trash cans to the back of the stores, which means adding \(2 \times 14 = 28\) trash cans.

Adding these together gives us:
\[ 14 \text{ (streets)} + 28 \text{ (back of stores)} = 42 \]

Therefore, the town has paid for a total of 42 trash cans.

#### GENERATION 16 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine the total number of trash cans the town has paid for, we need to consider two components: the trash cans added to the streets and the trash cans added to the back of stores. We are given that the council has added 14 trash cans to the streets and twice as many to the back of stores.

First, let's calculate the number of trash cans added to the back of stores. The problem states that they added twice as many trash cans to the back of stores as they did on the streets. Since they added 14 trash cans to the streets, we multiply this number by 2 to find the number of trash cans added to the back of stores:

\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \]

Now, we add the number of trash cans added to the streets and the number of trash cans added to the back of stores to find the total number of trash cans the town has paid for:

\[ 14 + 28 = 42 \]

Therefore, the town has paid for a total of 42 trash cans.
