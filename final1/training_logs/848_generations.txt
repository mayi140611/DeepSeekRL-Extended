The number of ants in the jar doubles each hour. So, if there are 50 ants in the jar initially, after 1 hour, there will be 50 * 2 = 100 ants. After 2 hours, there will be 100 * 2 = 200 ants. After 3 hours, there will be 200 * 2 = 400 ants. After 4 hours, there will be 400 * 2 = 800 ants. After 5 hours, there will be 800 * 2 = 1600 ants.

Initially, the jar has 50 ants. Each hour, the number of ants doubles. This means that at the end of each hour, the number of ants is multiplied by 2.

Let's calculate step by step:

- After 1 hour: \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) ants
- After 2 hours: \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \) ants
- After 3 hours: \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \) ants
- After 4 hours: \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) ants
- After 5 hours: \( 800 \times 2 = 1600 \) ants

So, after 5 hours, the jar will have 1600 ants.

Initially, there are 50 ants in the jar. In the first hour, the number of ants doubles, resulting in \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) ants. In the second hour, the number doubles again, resulting in \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \) ants. This process continues for each subsequent hour.

Thus, after the first hour, the number of ants becomes 100.
After the second hour, the number of ants becomes 200.
After the third hour, the number of ants becomes 400.
After the fourth hour, the number of ants becomes 800.
After the fifth hour, the number of ants becomes 1600.

Therefore, after 5 hours, there will be 1600 ants in the jar.

The initial number of ants in the jar is 50. Each hour, the number of ants doubles. Therefore, after the first hour, there will be \(50 \times 2 = 100\) ants. After the second hour, the number of ants will be \(100 \times 2 = 200\). This doubling process continues, so after 5 hours, the number of ants will be \(50 \times 2^5 = 50 \times 32 = 1600\).

To find that the number of ants after 5 hours, we calculate \(50 \times 32 = 1600\).

To determine the number of ants in the jar after 5 hours, we can start with the initial number of ants and then calculate the increase in quantity each hour.

- Initially, there are 50 ants.
- After 1 hour, the number of ants doubles to \(50 \times 2 = 100\) ants.
- After 2 hours, the number of ants doubles again to \(100 \times 2 = 200\) ants.
- This process continues for 3 hours, 4 hours, and 5 hours.

We can represent this as a sequence where each term is double the previous term starting from 50.

Let \( A(t) \) be the number of ants after \( t \) hours, then:

\[
A(0) = 50
\]
\[
A(1) = A(0) \times 2 = 50 \times 2 = 100
\]
\[
A(2) = A(1) \times 2 = 100 \times 2 = 200
\]
\[
A(3) = A(2) \times 2 = 200 \times 2 = 400
\]
\[
A(4) = A(3) \times 2 = 400 \times 2 = 800
\]
\[
A(5) = A(4) \times 2 = 800 \times 2 = 1600
\]

So, after 5 hours, the number of ants will be 1600.

After each hour, the number of ants in the jar doubles. Starting with 50 ants, the number of ants after the first hour would be \(50 \times 2 = 100\), after the second hour \(100 \times 2 = 200\), and so on.

After 5 hours, the number of ants would be \(50 \times 2^5\).

Initially, the jar contains 50 ants. The number of ants doubles every hour. Therefore, if we denote the number of ants at the end of one hour as \( A_1 \), then the number of ants at the end of two hours will be \( A_2 = 2 \times A_1 \), and so on. By the end of the fifth hour, the number of ants will be \( A_5 = 2 \times A_4 = 2 \times (2 \times A_3) = 2^5 \times A_2 \).

Since \( 50 \) ants are initially in the jar, after 5 hours, the number of ants in the jar will be:
\[
A_5 = 2^5 \times 50 = 32 \times 50 = 1600
\]
