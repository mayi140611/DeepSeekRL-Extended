###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

It took an alligator named Paul 4 hours to walk from his home at the River Nile to the Nile Delta.  On the return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, the journey taking 2 more hours than Paul took to walk to the Nile Delta, to reach their home at the River Nile. What's the combined time the alligators walked?

To find the combined time the alligators walked, we need to calculate the time each alligator took for each leg of the journey and then sum these times.

1. **First journey (to the Nile Delta):**
   - Paul took 4 hours for his single journey.
   - The return journey (to the River Nile) took Paul and six other alligators 2 more hours than his single journey, which means it took them \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

2. **Combined time for all six alligators:**
   - The six alligators took a total of \(4 + 6 = 10\) hours for the return journey.
   - Therefore, the combined time that all the alligators walked is the sum of Paul's single journey time and the combined return journey time for six alligators, which is \(4 + 6 = 10\) hours.

3. **Return journey time for Paul and the other four alligators individually:**
   - The other four alligators were going back to the River Nile with Paul.
   - For the return journey, Paul took 4 hours, and the other four alligators took \(4 - 2 = 2\) hours each.
   - Together, they took \(2 \times 3 + 2 = 8\) hours (Paul alone took 2 hours more than the other four alligators, which is \(6 + 2 = 8\)).

4. **Total combined time for all the returned journeys:**
   - The six alligators took 10 hours together, and Paul's four alligators took 8 hours together.
   - Therefore, the combined total time that all the alligators walked is \(10 + 8 = 18\) hours.

5. **Combined time for the return journeys and one solo trip (Paul's):**
   - Since it's not explicitly mentioned if there are solo trips, we'll assume there are no solo trips mentioned.
   - Therefore, the combined time the alligators walked is still \(10 + 8 = 18\) hours.

So, the combined time the alligators walked is \( \boxed{18} \) hours.

To find the combined time the alligators walked, we need to calculate the time each alligator spent walking.

1. The time taken by Paul to walk from his home at the River Nile to the Nile Delta is 4 hours.

2. On the return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators. The journey took 2 more hours than Paul took to walk to the Nile Delta, which means the return journey took \( 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \) hours.

3. The combined time Paul spent walking is his one-way journey plus the return journey:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. The return journey for Paul also involved a total of 6 alligators, so each alligator spent \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{6} = 1 \text{ hour} \) on the return journey.

5. Now we need to calculate the combined time for all six alligators.

   - For Paul: 10 hours
   - For all six other alligators: 6 alligators * 1 hour/alligator = 6 hours

6. Adding these times together:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the combined time the alligators walked is 16 hours.

To find the combined time the alligators walked, we need to calculate the time each alligator spent walking and then sum these times.

First, let's determine how much time each alligator walked:

1. Paul took 4 hours to walk from his home to the Nile Delta.
2. The other seven alligators (including Paul) traveled back with six other alligators, which took an additional 2 hours on the return journey.

The combined time for all the other alligators is:
\[ \text{Time for the eight alligators} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add Paul's time to the time of the other alligators:
\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the combined time the alligators walked is 10 hours.

Let's calculate the time it took the alligators to return. The return journey took 2 more hours than the trip to the Nile Delta, which took 4 hours. So, the return journey took:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

There were six other alligators returning with Paul. Therefore, the joint return journey time is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total time the alligators walked, we add the time Paul walked to the Nile Delta and the time the six other alligators walked back:

\[ 4 + 36 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it took Paul to travel to the Nile Delta:

\[ 4 \text{ hours} \]

Summing up the time Paul walked to the Nile Delta and the time the other alligators walked back:
\[ 4 + 36 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

To find the combined time the alligators walked, we need to calculate the time each alligator took for their respective journeys.

For Paul, he took 4 hours to walk to the Nile Delta.

On the return journey, there are six other alligators. Their journey took 2 more hours than Paul. Therefore, it took 4 + 2 = 6 hours for the group of six alligators to return to the River Nile.

Now, we add up the times taken by all the alligators:
- Paul took 4 hours.
- Each of the six other alligators took 6 hours.
So, the combined time taken by the six other alligators is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) hours.

The total combined time taken for Paul and the other alligators is:
\[ 4 + 36 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the combined time the alligators walked is 40 hours.

Let's denote the time Paul took to walk to the Nile Delta as \( t = 4 \) hours. The return journey took 2 more hours than the walk to the Nile Delta, which means it took \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) hours.

However, we need to consider the time taken for the other alligators return journey. Since there are 6 other alligators, the return journey took \( 6 \) hours for each alligator. Therefore, the total time for the return journey by all the alligators is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) hours.

To find the combined time the alligators walked, we need to combine the time Paul took to walk to the Nile Delta and the time the other alligators took to walk back home. This gives us a total of \( 4 + 36 = 40 \) hours.

Therefore, the combined time the alligators walked is 40 hours.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time taken by Paul and the other alligators on their journeys.

1. First, we calculate the time taken by Paul. It is given as 4 hours.
2. For the return journey, it is mentioned that the journey took 2 more hours than the time it took for Paul to walk to the Nile Delta. So, the time taken by the other alligators on the return journey is:
   4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.
3. The total time taken by Paul and the other alligators on their return journey is 6 hours.
4. Now, we need to find the total time taken by all the alligators on the return journey. When we include Paul's time, the total time taken is:
   4 hours (Paul's time) + 6 hours (time taken by the other alligators) = 10 hours.

Therefore, the combined time the alligators walked is 10 hours.

Let's denote the time it took Paul to walk to the Nile Delta as \( T \). According to the problem, \( T = 4 \) hours.

For the return journey with six other alligators, the time taken is \( T + 2 \) hours. So, the return journey took \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) hours.

To find the combined time the alligators walked, we add the time each alligator took. Paul walked for 4 hours, and each of the other five alligators walked for 6 hours.

The total walking time is calculated as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ hours (Paul)} + 5 \times 6 \text{ hours (the other alligators)} \]

First, calculate \( 5 \times 6 \):
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Now add Paul's time to the times of the other five alligators:
\[ 4 + 30 = 34 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total combined time the alligators walked is 34 hours.

To determine the combined time the alligators walked, we need to calculate the individual times for both the trip to the Nile Delta and the return journey, then sum these times.

First, let's find the time it took for Paul to walk to the Nile Delta:
- It took Paul 4 hours to walk from his home at the River Nile to the Nile Delta.

Next, we calculate the time it took for Paul to return:
- The return journey took 2 more hours than the trip to the Nile Delta.
- Therefore, the return journey took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

Now, we find the combined time for both journeys:
- The total time for the trip to the Nile Delta was 4 hours.
- The total time for the return journey was 6 hours.
- Combined time for both journeys was \(4 + 6 = 10\) hours.

Finally, we need to consider that the alligators traveling with Paul on the return journey are not included in his combined time but rather in the return journey themselves.
- When traveling back, the six alligators also spent 6 hours.
- Therefore, we need to add these 6 hours to the combined time of the journey to the Nile Delta.

Total combined time:
- Paul's time to the Nile Delta: 4 hours.
- Paul's time for the return journey: 6 hours.
- Addition of the alligators' travel time: 6 hours.

So, the total combined time is:
- \(4 + 6 + 6 = 16\) hours.

Therefore, the total time all the alligators walked is 16 hours.

First, let's calculate the time it took Paul to walk back to the River Nile. Since the return journey took 2 more hours than the original journey, we have:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, Paul took 6 hours to walk back.

Next, we need to find out how long it took the other six alligators to walk back. Since Paul and the other six alligators traveled together, and the journey took 6 hours in total, we have:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} - 4 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the other six alligators took 2 hours to walk back.

Now we know that each alligator (Paul and the six that traveled with him) took 6 hours to walk back. Therefore, the total time all the alligators took to walk back is:

\[ 1 \text{ alligator} \times 6 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ alligators} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} + 36 \text{ hours} = 42 \text{ hours} \]

Adding up the time for all the alligators, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 42 \text{ hours} = 46 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the combined time the alligators walked is 46 hours.

To determine the combined time the alligators walked, we need to calculate the time each alligator spent walking separately and then sum these times.

1. **Time to walk to the Nile Delta:**
   Paul took 4 hours to walk to the Nile Delta.

2. **Return journey:**
   On the return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, and the journey took 2 more hours than it took for Paul to walk to the Nile Delta. Therefore, the return journey took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

3. **Combined time:**
   Paul's return journey time was shared among 7 alligators (including Paul). The return journey time for each alligator was \(\frac{6}{7}\) hours. The calculation for each alligator is:
   \[
   \text{Time per alligator (return journey)} = \frac{6}{7} \text{ hours}
   \]

   The time for each of the six other alligators during the return journey would also be \(\frac{6}{7}\) hours. 

   Now, let’s sum up all the times.

4. **Total alligator return journey times:**
   The total time for each of the six other alligators is:
   \[
   \text{Time for each of the six other alligators} = \frac{6}{7} \times 6 = \frac{36}{7} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Including Paul who returned alone, we calculate Paul's return journey time:
   \[
   \text{Paul's return journey time} = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Now, summing up all the times:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 2 + \left(1 \times \frac{36}{7} \right) + \left(6 \times \frac{36}{7} \right)
   \]
   Recognize the common factor \(\frac{36}{7}\), but we also consider that only six alligators made the return journey:

   Simplify this expression to:
   \[
   2 + \left(\frac{36}{7} + 36 \times \frac{36}{7}\right) = 2 + \frac{36}{7} + 36 \times \frac{36}{7}
   \]
   Compute numerically and add:
   \[
   2 + \frac{36}{7} + 36 \times \frac{36}{7} = 2 + 36 + \frac{36 \times 36}{7} = 38
   \]

Therefore, the combined time alligators walked is:

Let's denote the distance from the River Nile to the Nile Delta as \( D \) distance units. On the way to the Nile Delta, Paul walked alone in 4 hours, so his speed is \( \frac{D}{4} \) distance units per hour. 

On the return journey, Paul and six other alligators traveled with his home at the River Nile to the Nile Delta. So, the combined speed for the return journey is \( \frac{D}{4+6} = \frac{D}{10} \) distance units per hour.

The time taken for the return journey is given as 2 hours more than the time taken to walk to the Nile Delta, which is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) hours. 

Using the formula \( \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \), we can equate the two parts of the journey:

1. For the way to the Nile Delta: \( \frac{D}{4} = \frac{D}{10} \) hours
2. For the return journey: \( \frac{D}{4} = \frac{D}{10} \times \frac{4+6}{6} = \frac{4D}{10} \)

Thus, the combined time that all the alligators walked is the sum of the time to the Nile Delta and the return journey, which is \( 4 + 6 = 10 \) hours for Paul. Including the time for the six other alligators, the total time is \( 10 \) hours (one alligator) + \( 7 \times 4 \) hours (for seven alligators) = \( 10 + 28 = 38 \) hours.
