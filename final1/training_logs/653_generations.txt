To determine when Pete should leave, we need to calculate the total travel time and subtract it from his desired departure time of 0900 hours.

1. Calculate the total travel time:
   - The train ride takes 1 hour and 20 minutes.
   - The walk to the train station takes 10 minutes.
   - Total travel time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 10 minutes = 1 hour 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

2. Convert 90 minutes to hours and minutes:
   - 90 minutes is 1 hour and 30 minutes.

3. Since Pete cannot arrive in LA later than 0900 hours, he needs to leave at least 1 hour and 30 minutes before 0900 hours.

4. Subtract the travel time from the desired departure time in 24-hour format:
   - 0900 hours - 1 hour 30 minutes = 0730 hours.

Therefore, Pete should leave at 0730 hours to arrive in LA before 0900 hours.

To determine when Pete should leave, we need to calculate the total travel time from his home to LA and then work backwards from his desired departure time of 0900 hours.

First, let's calculate the total travel time:
- The 10-minute walk to the train station.
- The 1 hour and 20-minute train ride to LA.

Total travel time: 10 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes = 320 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the train ride time to hours:
1 hour 20 minutes = 1.3333 hours (approximately)

Now, to find the earliest time Pete should leave:
- Pete wants to be at the train station by 0900 hours.
- The total travel time is 320 minutes, or 5 hours 20 minutes.

So, if we subtract 5 hours 20 minutes from 0900 hours, we get:
9:00 hours - 5:20 hours = 3:40 hours

This means Pete should leave at 0340 hours (3:40 AM) to arrive at the train station by 0900 hours.

To determine when Pete should leave, we first need to calculate the total travel time and then work backwards from the desired departure time of 0900 hours.

The journey consists of:
- 10 minutes walk to the train station
- 1 hour 20 minutes train ride to LA

First, let's sum the travel time:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes} + 1 \text{ hour 20 minutes} = 1 \text{ hour 30 minutes} \]

Pete should be at the train station by 0900 hours. Adding the travel time of 1 hour 30 minutes to 0900 hours:
\[ 0900 + 1 \text{ hour } 30 \text{ minutes} = 1030 \]

Therefore, Pete should leave by 1030 hours (or 10:30 PM) to arrive at the train station by 0900 hours.

To determine when Pete should leave, we need to calculate the total time he will be traveling and add it to his desired arrival time of 0900 hours.

First, convert the train travel time into minutes:
1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, add the 10-minute walk to the train travel time:
80 minutes + 10 minutes = 90 minutes

Convert the total travel time back into hours and minutes:
90 minutes = 1 hour and 30 minutes

Now, add this travel time to Pete's desired arrival time of 0900 hours:
0900 + 1 hour and 30 minutes = 1030 hours

Therefore, Pete should leave by 1030 hours.

To find out when Pete should leave, we need to first calculate the total travel time for the trip.

1. The 10-minute walk to the train station.
2. The 1 hour and 20 minutes train ride.

Total travel time = 10 minutes + 70 minutes = 80 minutes.

Now we need to work backward from 0900 hours to find the earliest time Pete should leave.

Since Pete needs to arrive by 0900 hours, we subtract the total travel time from 0900 hours:

0900 - 80 minutes = 0820 hours (which is 08:20 AM).

So Pete should leave **0820 hours** to ensure he arrives at 0900 hours in LA.

First, we need to convert all the times, including Pete's leaving time, to a single time format for easier calculation. 0900 hours is 09:00 in 24-hour time.

Pete needs to be at the station for 10 minutes and the train takes 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Let's start by calculating the total time from his leaving until he arrives at the train station and then on the train:
- 10 minutes walk to the station
- 1 hour and 20 minutes on the train

Total time to reach LA:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now Pete needs to subtract the total travel time from his desired arrival time of 0900 hours.

Therefore, Pete needs to leave 1 hour before 0900 hours.

To determine when Pete should leave, let's break down the total travel time and add that to his desired departure time of 0900 hours.

1. **Train Travel Time**:
   - The train is 1 hour and 20 minutes long, which is 120 minutes.
   
2. **Walk Time**:
   - The walk to the train station is 10 minutes, which is 10 minutes.

   Total travel time = Walk time + Train travel time
   - \( 10 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} = 130 \text{ minutes} \)

3. **Convert Desired Departure Time to Minutes**:
   - 0900 hours is 0900 hours (24-hour time) which is \( 0 \times 60 + 9 = 9 \) hours.
   
4. **Calculate Departure Time**:
   - Departure time = Desired departure time + Total travel time
   - \( 9 \text{ hours} + 130 \text{ minutes} \)
   
   Since 130 minutes is 2 hours and 10 minutes:
   - \( 9 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} 10 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ hours and } 10 \text{ minutes} \)
   
   Therefore, Pete should leave at 11:10 hours.

To determine when Pete should leave, we need to consider both the time he spends walking and the time he spends on the train.

1. On the way to the train station ("in-town") it takes 10 minutes to walk.
2. The trip to LA by train takes 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Adding these times together, the total time Pete will spend traveling is:
10 minutes for walking + 1 hour and 20 minutes for the train = 1 hour and 30 minutes in total.

Since we need to account for the 900 hours, which is:
\[ 9 \times 60 = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

We subtract the total travel time from the departure time:
\[ 540 \text{ minutes } - 10 \text{ minutes } - 120 \text{ minutes } = 410 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 410 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 6 \text{ hours } 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Pete needs to leave at 15:10 (3:10 PM) to arrive in LA by 09:00 hours.

First, we calculate the total travel time. Pete's walk takes 10 minutes, and the train ride takes 1 hour and 20 minutes. Adding these times together: 10 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes = 1 hour 30 minutes. This means Pete will arrive in LA 1 hour and 30 minutes after he leaves his house.

The maximum time Pete can leave his house without arriving in LA later than 09:00 hours is:

9:00 hours - 1 hour 30 minutes = 7:30 hours.

So, Pete should leave his house by 07:30.

To determine when Pete should leave, we need to calculate the total duration of his trip and the time he should leave to arrive by 0900 hours.

1. The walk to the train station takes 10 minutes. The remaining time after the walk is the time it takes to board the train, which is 1 hour and 20 minutes.
2. Convert the walk duration into hours: 10 minutes / 60 = 1/6 of an hour.
3. Convert the train boarding time into hours: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 1.33 hours.
4. The total trip duration is 1/6 + 1.33 = 1.65 hours, or 1 hour and 39 minutes.

5. Let \( T \) be the departure time. If Pete arrives in LA by 0900 hours, then \( T + 1:39 = 09:00 \). 

6. Subtracting 1 hour and 39 minutes from 0900 gives us the departure time: 0900 - 1 hour 39 minutes = 0721.

The answer is 0721.

To determine when Pete should leave, we need to work backwards from his arrival time in LA.

1. Pete arrives in LA at 0900 hours (24-hour time).
2. The train ride takes 1 hour and 20 minutes, so Pete arrives at the train station at:
   0900 - 1 hour 20 minutes = 0740 hours (4:40 AM)

3. The walk from the train station to LA typically takes about 10 minutes, but for simplicity, we'll assume the walk is immediate:
   0740 + 1 hour 10 minutes = 0850 hours (6:50 AM)

Therefore, Pete should leave at 0850 hours (6:50 AM).

To determine when Pete should leave, we need to calculate the total duration of his journey and the allowable departure time from the time he arrives in LA.

1. Pete needs to take a 10-minute walk to the train station.
2. Then, he needs to board a 1 hour 20-minute train.
3. The total travel time is 10 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes = 32 minutes + 60 minutes = 92 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 92 minutes into hours and minutes:
92 minutes = 1 hour 22 minutes.

So, Pete needs 1 hour 22 minutes total time from when he leaves until he arrives in LA.

When does Pete need to arrive in LA? According to the problem, he needs to arrive before 0900 hours (9:00 AM). Therefore, he has 12:00 PM – 09:00 AM = 3 hours before his arrival time. Since he needs 1 hour and 22 minutes, he should leave:
3:22 PM.

To determine when Pete should leave, let's break down the travel time and add the time he needs to get to LA.

1. The total travel time is 1 hour 20 minutes for the train. Converting this to minutes: 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.
2. Adding the 10-minute walk down to the train station gives: 80 minutes + 10 minutes = 90 minutes.

Now, let's convert 90 minutes to hours to understand the start time better. 90 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour and 30 minutes.

So Pete needs to leave by 10:30 AM to be at the train station by 10:00 AM.

Therefore, 10:30 AM must be his departure time.

Since the travel time is 1 hour and 20 minutes and he has to leave at 10:30 AM, we can subtract the total travel time from 10:30 AM to determine the latest he can leave. 10:30 AM - 1 hour and 20 minutes = 9:10 AM.

Hence, 9:10 AM is when he should leave.

To determine when Pete should leave, we need to work backwards from his arrival time in LA. 

First, let's calculate the train's arrival time in LA:
- Train duration: 1 hour 20 minutes
- Total travel time: 1 hour 20 minutes + 10 minutes walk = 2 hours 40 minutes

Pete's train departs at the earliest possible time so that he arrives at 09:00 (LA time). To find when the train departs, we subtract the 2 hours 40 minutes from 09:00.

09:00 - 2 hours 40 minutes = 06:20

So, the train departs at 06:20.

Next, we need to account for Pete's walk from the train station to his house. Pete is expected to take a 10-minute walk.

06:20 - 10 minutes = 06:10

Therefore, Pete should leave at 06:10 to ensure he arrives in LA by 09:00.
