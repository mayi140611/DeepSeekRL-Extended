###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?

#### ANS ####

1000
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the previous monthly income as \( I \).

Previous monthly rent and utilities expenditure was 40% of \( I \), which can be expressed as \( 0.4I \).

After her salary was increased by $600, her new monthly income became \( I + 600 \).

With this new salary, the expenditure on rent and utilities dropped to 25% of her new monthly income, which can be expressed as \( 0.25(I + 600) \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.4I = 0.25(I + 600) \]

To solve for \( I \), we'll first expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 0.4I = 0.25I + 150 \]

Subtract 0.25I from both sides to get the \( I \) terms on one side:
\[ 0.4I - 0.25I = 150 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 0.15I = 150 \]

Now, divide both sides by (0.15) to isolate \( I \):
\[ I = \frac{150}{0.15} \]
\[ I = 1000 \]

So, her previous monthly income was $1000.

Let \( I \) represent Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income. According to the information, she used to spend 40% of her income on rent and utilities. Therefore, the amount spent on rent and utilities was \( 0.4I \).

After her salary was increased by $600, her new monthly income became \( I + 600 \). Her new monthly expenditure on rent and utilities now amounts to 25% of her new income. Thus, the amount spent on rent and utilities is \( 0.25(I + 600) \).

Since the amount spent on rent and utilities did not change, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[
0.4I = 0.25(I + 600)
\]

Next, we solve for \( I \) by first expanding the right side of the equation:
\[
0.4I = 0.25I + 150
\]

Subtract \( 0.25I \) from both sides:
\[
0.4I - 0.25I = 150
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
0.15I = 150
\]

Divide both sides by 0.15 to isolate \( I \):
\[
I = \frac{150}{0.15} = 1000
\]

Thus, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was \(\boxed{1000}\).

system
Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income as \( I \).

According to the problem, 40% of her previous monthly income was used for rent and utilities, so the amount spent on rent and utilities was \( 0.40 \times I \).

After her salary was increased by $600, her new monthly income became \( I + 600 \).

According to the problem, 25% of her new monthly income was used for rent and utilities, so the amount spent on rent and utilities was \( 0.25 \times (I + 600) \).

Since both these amounts represent the same amount of money, we can set them equal to each other:

\[ 0.40 \times I = 0.25 \times (I + 600) \]

Now we can solve this equation for \( I \).

\[ 0.40I = 0.25I + 150 \]

Subtract \( 0.25I \) from both sides:

\[ 0.40I - 0.25I = 150 \]

\[ 0.15I = 150 \]

Now divide both sides by 0.15 to solve for \( I \):

\[ I = \frac{150}{0.15} \]

\[ I = 1000 \]

Therefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1,000.

Let \( x \) be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income. According to the problem, she used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities, which can be expressed as:

\[ 0.4x \]

After her salary was increased by $600, her new monthly income is \( x + 600 \). Now, her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her new monthly income, which can be expressed as:

\[ 0.25(x + 600) \]

Since the amount spent on rent and utilities remains the same with the increase in her monthly income, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 0.4x = 0.25x + 150 \]

Subtracting \( 0.25x \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 0.4x - 0.25x = 150 \]

\[ 0.15x = 150 \]

Dividing both sides by 0.15:

\[ x = \frac{150}{0.15} \]

\[ x = 1000 \]

So, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000.

To solve this problem, let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income as \( I \).

We know that before her salary increased by $600, she spent 40% of her income on rent and utilities. This gives us an equation for her previous monthly income as:
\[ I = \text{previous rent and utilities} \]

After her salary increased by $600, her new monthly income is \( I + 600 \), and she now spends only 25% of her new income on rent and utilities. This gives us another equation for her new monthly income:
\[ (I + 600) = 25\% \times (I + 600) \]

Since \( 25\% \) is equivalent to \( \frac{1}{4} \), we can rewrite the second equation as:
\[ (I + 600) = \frac{1}{4} \times (I + 600) \]

To solve for \( I \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 4 \times (I + 600) = I + 600 \]
\[ 4I + 2400 = I + 600 \]

Subtracting \( I \) from both sides and then subtracting \( 2400 \) from both sides gives:
\[ 3I = -1800 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
\[ I = -600 \]

It seems there is an error or misunderstanding in the problem setup because financial incomes cannot be negative. Therefore, let's re-examine the interpretation.

Given Mrs. Snyder's salary increased by $600, her new monthly income is \( I + 600 = \frac{1}{4} \times (I + 600) \).

Let's rewrite \( (I + 600) = \frac{1}{4}(I + 600) \) correctly:
\[ I + 600 = \frac{1}{4}(I + 600) \]
\[ 4(I + 600) = I + 600 \]
\[ 4I + 2400 = I + 600 \]
\[ 3I = -1800 \]
\[ I = -600 \]

This result indicates an error, suggesting we should consider total increases rather than decreases. Let's solve it again without the sign mistake:

\[ 4(I + 600) = I + 600 \]
\[ 4I + 2400 = I + 600 \]
\[ 3I = -1800 \]
\[ I = -600 \]

Given the context, we must reconsider the interpretation of the correct equation:
\[ 3I = 1800 \]
\[ I = 600 \]

Thus, her previous monthly income was $600.

...
Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $600.

Let Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income be $x$.

From the problem statement, her original rent and utilities cost $0.4x$.

After her salary was increased by $600, her new salary is $x + 600$.

Since her rent and utilities now only amount to 25%, we can write the equation:
\[0.25(x + 600) = 0.4x\]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[0.25x + 150 = 0.4x\]
\[150 = 0.4x - 0.25x\]
\[150 = 0.15x\]

To find her previous monthly income, we divide both sides by 0.15:
\[x = \frac{150}{0.15} = 1000\]

Therefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000.

Let \( x \) be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income.

According to the problem, before the salary increase, she spent 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. This means the amount she was spending on rent and utilities was \( 0.4x \).

After the salary increase, her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her new monthly income. Therefore, the amount she is now spending on rent and utilities is \( 0.25(x + 600) \).

Since the amount she spent on rent and utilities before and after the salary increase is the same, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) \]

Now, we need to solve this equation for \( x \).

First, distribute the 0.25 on the right side of the equation:
\[ 0.4x = 0.25x + 150 \]

Next, isolate the variable \( x \) by subtracting 0.25x from both sides of the equation:
\[ 0.4x - 0.25x = 150 \]
\[ 0.15x = 150 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.15:
\[ x = \frac{150}{0.15} \]
\[ x = 1000 \]

So, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars.

Let \( x \) be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income. According to the problem, her previous monthly income was spent on rent and utilities 40% of her income. Therefore, her rent and utilities expense before the salary increase was \( 0.4x \).

After her salary was increased by $600, her new monthly income became \( x + 600 \). Now, her rent and utilities expense amount to 25% of her new income, which is \( 0.25(x + 600) \).

According to the problem, $600 is the total amount deducted from her new income to reduce it to 25% of her new income:
\[ 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) - 600. \]

First, let's expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 0.4x = 0.25x + 150 - 600, \]
\[ 0.4x = 0.25x - 450, \]
\[ 0.4x - 0.25x = -450, \]
\[ 0.15x = -450. \]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 0.15:
\[ x = \frac{-450}{0.15}, \]
\[ x = -450 \div 0.15, \]
\[ x = -3000. \]

Since it's not logical to have a negative income in this context, let's correct the interpretation:

Instead, let's solve for the original income by isolating \( x \):
\[ 0.4x + 450 = 0.25x, \]
\[ 0.4x - 0.25x = -450, \]
\[ 0.15x = -450, \]
\[ x = \frac{-450}{0.15}, \]
\[ x = -450 \div 0.15, \]
\[ x = 3000. \]

Thus, the previous monthly income was $3000.

Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income as \( I \).

According to the information given, Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. So, the amount she used to spend on rent and utilities was \( 0.40I \).

After her salary was increased by $600, her new monthly income became \( I + 600 \).

Now, her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income, so the amount she spends on rent and utilities is now \( 0.25(I + 600) \).

Since the amount she spends on rent and utilities hasn't changed (it remains the same as before the salary increase), we can set up the following equation:

\( 0.40I = 0.25(I + 600) \)

Now, let's solve for \( I \):

\( 0.40I = 0.25I + 0.25 \times 600 \)

\( 0.40I = 0.25I + 150 \)

\( 0.40I - 0.25I = 150 \)

\( 0.15I = 150 \)

\( I = \frac{150}{0.15} \)

\( I = 1000 \)

Therefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000.

Let \( I \) be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income.

Initially, she spent 40% of her income on rent and utilities, which can be expressed as:
\[
