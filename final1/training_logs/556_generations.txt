system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes:**
   Andy has 18 plants with 7 tomatoes each.
   $$ \text{Total tomatoes} = 18 \times 7 = 126 $$

2. **Determine how many tomatoes are dried:**
   Andy dries half of the tomatoes.
   $$ \text{Tomatoes dried} = \frac{126}{2} = 63 $$

3. **Calculate the number of tomatoes left after drying:**
   $$ \text{Tomatoes left after drying} = 126 - 63 = 63 $$

4. **Determine how many tomatoes are used to make marinara sauce:**
   Andy turns a third of the remaining tomatoes into marinara sauce.
   $$ \text{Tomatoes used for marinara} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 $$

5. **Calculate the number of tomatoes left after making marinara sauce:**
   $$ \text{Tomatoes left after marinara} = 63 - 21 = 42 $$

Therefore, the number of tomatoes left is 42.

First, we need to find out the total number of tomatoes Andy harvests. We do this by multiplying the number of plants by the number of tomatoes each plant produces:

\[ 18 \text{ plants} \times 7 \text{ tomatoes per plant} = 126 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, Andy dries half of the tomatoes, so we calculate half of 126:

\[ \frac{126}{2} = 63 \text{ tomatoes dried} \]

We then subtract the number of dried tomatoes from the total number of tomatoes to find the number of tomatoes remaining:

\[ 126 \text{ tomatoes} - 63 \text{ tomatoes} = 63 \text{ tomatoes} \]

After drying, Andy turns a third of the remaining tomatoes into marinara sauce. We calculate a third of 84 by multiplying:

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \text{ tomatoes for marinara sauce} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of tomatoes used for the marinara sauce from the remaining tomatoes:

\[ 63 \text{ tomatoes} - 21 \text{ tomatoes} = 42 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the number of tomatoes left is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]

First, let's determine the total number of tomatoes Andy harvests from the 18 plants. Each plant has 7 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes is:

\[ 18 \times 7 = 126 \]

Next, we need to calculate how many tomatoes Andy dries. He dries half of the tomatoes, so:

\[ \frac{126}{2} = 63 \]

After drying, he has 63 tomatoes left. Then, he turns a third of these remaining tomatoes into marinara sauce. So, the number of tomatoes used for marinara sauce is:

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

This means the number of tomatoes left after making marinara sauce is:

\[ 63 - 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of tomatoes left is:

\[ 42 \]

To find out how many tomatoes are left, we'll calculate the total number of tomatoes first, which is 18 plants * 7 tomatoes per plant = 126 tomatoes. Andy dries half, so he dries 126/2 = 63 tomatoes. The remainder is 126 - 63 = 63. Then he turns 1/3 of them into marinara sauce, so he makes 63 * 1/3 = 21 tomatoes into marinara sauce. Hence, the remaining tomatoes are 63 - 21 = 42.

First, we need to determine the total number of tomatoes harvested. Each of the 18 plants has 7 tomatoes, so the total is calculated as follows:

\[ 18 \times 7 = 126 \]

Next, Andy dries half of these tomatoes. Half of 126 is:

\[ \frac{126}{2} = 63 \]

This means he dries 63 tomatoes and has \( 126 - 63 = 63 \) tomatoes left. Then, Andy turns a third of the remaining 63 tomatoes into marinara sauce. A third of 63 is:

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, he uses 21 tomatoes for the marinara sauce, leaving him with \( 63 - 21 = 42 \) tomatoes. 

Thus, the number of tomatoes left is:

\[ 42 \]

Andy has a total of \( 18 \times 7 = 126 \) tomatoes. He dries half of these, which is \( 126 / 2 = 63 \) tomatoes. The remaining tomatoes are \( 126 - 63 = 63 \).

He then turns a third of the remaining tomatoes into marinara sauce, which is \( 63 / 3 = 21 \) tomatoes. Therefore, the number of tomatoes left is \( 63 - 21 = 42 \).

To determine how many tomatoes are left, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tomatoes.
2. Determine how many tomatoes are dried.
3. Calculate how many tomatoes are left after drying.
4. Determine how many tomatoes are turned into marinara sauce.
5. Calculate how many tomatoes are left after making the sauce.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tomatoes.
Total tomatoes = Number of plants × Number of tomatoes per plant
Total tomatoes = 18 plants × 7 tomatoes/plant
Total tomatoes = 126 tomatoes

Step 2: Determine how many tomatoes are dried.
Since Andy dries half of the tomatoes:
Tomatoes dried = 1/2 × Total tomatoes
Tomatoes dried = 1/2 × 126
Tomatoes dried = 63 tomatoes

Step 3: Calculate how many tomatoes are left after drying.
Tomatoes left after drying = Total tomatoes - Tomatoes dried
Tomatoes left after drying = 126 - 63
Tomatoes left after drying = 63 tomatoes

Step 4: Determine how many tomatoes are turned into marinara sauce.
Since Andy turns a third of the remainder into marinara sauce:
Tomatoes for sauce = 1/3 × Tomatoes left after drying
Tomatoes for sauce = 1/3 × 63
Tomatoes for sauce = 21 tomatoes

Step 5: Calculate how many tomatoes are left after making the sauce.
Tomatoes left after making sauce = Tomatoes left after drying - Tomatoes for sauce
Tomatoes left after making sauce = 63 - 21
Tomatoes left after making sauce = 42 tomatoes

Therefore, after all these processes, there are 42 tomatoes left.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Count of Tomatoes**: Andy harvests tomatoes from 18 plants, with each plant having 7 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes can be calculated as:
   \[
   Total = 18 \times 7
   \]

2. **Drying Process**: Andy dries half of these tomatoes. So, the number of tomatoes after drying would be:
   \[
   Dryed = \frac{Total}{2}
   \]

3. **Remaining Tomatoes After Drying**: The remaining tomatoes after drying would be:
   \[
   Remaining = Total - Dryed
   \]

4. **Conversion to Marinara Sauce**: Andy turns a third of the remaining tomatoes into marinara sauce. So, the number of tomatoes used for marinara sauce would be:
   \[
   Used_for_sauce = \frac{Remaining}{3}
   \]
   The number of tomatoes left after making marinara sauce would be:
   \[
   Left_after_sauce = Remaining - Used_for_sauce
   \]

Now, let's calculate:

1. **Total Tomatoes**:
   \[
   Total = 18 \times 7 = 126
   \]

2. **Tomatoes Dried**:
   \[
   Dryed = \frac{126}{2} = 63
   \]

3. **Tomatoes Remaining After Drying**:
   \[
   Remaining = 126 - 63 = 63
   \]

4. **Tomatoes for Marinara Sauce**:
   \[
   Used_for_sauce = \frac{63}{3} = 21
   \]

5. **Tomatoes Left After Marinara Sauce**:
   \[
   Left_after_sauce = 63 - 21 = 42
   \]

So, the number of tomatoes left is 42.

To solve this problem, we'll first calculate the total number of tomatoes Andy has harvested.

Total tomatoes = Number of plants * Tomatoes per plant
Total tomatoes = 18 * 7
Total tomatoes = 126

Andy dries half of the tomatoes:
Tomatoes dried = 1/2 * Total tomatoes
Tomatoes dried = 1/2 * 126
Tomatoes dried = 63

The remaining tomatoes after drying are:
Remaining tomatoes after drying = Total tomatoes - Tomatoes dried
Remaining tomatoes after drying = 126 - 63
Remaining tomatoes after drying = 63

Then, Andy turns a third of these remaining tomatoes into marinara sauce:
Tomatoes turned into sauce = 1/3 * Remaining tomatoes after drying
Tomatoes turned into sauce = 1/3 * 63
Tomatoes turned into sauce = 21

The remaining tomatoes after making the sauce are:
Remaining tomatoes after making sauce = Remaining tomatoes after drying - Tomatoes turned into sauce
Remaining tomatoes after making sauce = 63 - 21
Remaining tomatoes after making sauce = 42
