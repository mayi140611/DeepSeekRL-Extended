<reasoning>
First, we need to calculate the number of cookies Sabrina's mother gave her. Since her mother gave her half the number of cookies Sabrina gave to her brother, we calculate:

\[
\text{Cookies given by mother} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ cookies}
\]

Next, we need to find out the total number of cookies Sabrina had after receiving cookies from her mother:

\[
\text{Total cookies after receiving from mother} = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ cookies}
\]

Now, we calculate the number of cookies Sabrina gave to her sister. She gave two-thirds of her total cookies to her sister:

\[
\text{Cookies given to sister} = \frac{2}{3} \times 25 = \frac{50}{3} = 16.67 \text{ cookies}
\]

Since the number of cookies must be an integer, we'll round down to the nearest whole number because you can't give a fraction of a cookie:

\[
\text{Cookies given to sister} = 16 \text{ cookies}
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of cookies left with Sabrina by subtracting the cookies she gave to her sister from the total cookies she had before giving any away:

\[
\text{Cookies left} = 25 - 16 = 9 \text{ cookies}
\]

Let's start by determining how many cookies Sabrina had initially: 20 cookies.

Sabrina gave 10 cookies to her brother, so she has:
20 - 10 = 10 cookies left.

Her mother then gave her half the number of cookies she gave her brother, which is:
10 / 2 = 5 cookies.

After receiving these cookies from her mother, Sabrina has:
10 + 5 = 15 cookies.

Sabrina then gave two-thirds of her cookies to her sister. The two-thirds she gave to her sister is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 15 = 10 \text{ cookies}.
\]

After giving these cookies to her sister, Sabrina has:
15 - 10 = 5 cookies left.

Sabrina initially had 20 cookies. She gave 10 cookies to her brother, so she had \(20 - 10 = 10\) cookies left. Her mother gave her half the number of cookies she gave her brother, which is \(10 / 2 = 5\) cookies. Now, the total number of cookies Sabrina has is \(10 + 5 = 15\). Then, Sabrina gave two-thirds of her cookies to her sister, so she gave \(2/3 \times 15 = 10\) cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left with her is \(15 - 10 = 5\).

After Sabrina gave 10 cookies to her brother, she had 20 - 10 = 10 cookies left. 
Her mother then gave her half that amount, which is 10 / 2 = 5 cookies.

So, in total, Sabrina had 10 + 5 = 15 cookies.
Then, Sabrina gave two-thirds of her cookies to her sister, which is 2/3 * 15 = 10 cookies.

Therefore, Sabrina was left with 15 - 10 = 5 cookies.

First, we need to determine the total number of cookies Sabrina received initially from her brother and her mother. Sabrina gave 10 cookies to her brother, and her mother gave her half of what she gave her brother. So, her mother gave her \(10 / 2 = 5\) cookies. Adding these together, Sabrina received a total of \(10 + 5 = 15\) cookies.

Then, Sabrina gave two-thirds of her cookies to her sister. So, she gave \(\frac{2}{3} \times 20 = \frac{40}{3} = 13.\overline{3}\) cookies. Since the number of cookies must be a whole number, we will round this to the nearest whole number, which is 13 cookies.

Subtracting the cookies given to her sister from the total number of cookies Sabrina had initially, we get \(20 - 13 = 7\) cookies left.

Therefore, the number of cookies Sabrina has left is 7.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cookies**: Sabrina had 20 cookies.
2. **First Distribution**: She gave 10 cookies to her brother.
   - Remaining cookies = Initial cookies - Cookies given to brother
   - Remaining cookies = 20 - 10 = 10 cookies.
3. **Second Distribution**: Her mother gave her half the number of cookies she gave to her brother.
   - Cookies given to mother = 10 / 2 = 5 cookies.
   - Remaining cookies = 10 - 5 = 5 cookies.
4. **Third Distribution**: She gave two-thirds of her cookies to her sister.
   - Cookies given to sister = (2/3) * 5 = 10 / 3 ≈ 3.33 cookies (since the number of cookies must be a whole number, we interpret this as 3 cookies).
   - Remaining cookies = 5 - 3 = 2 cookies.

So, the final number of cookies Sabrina has left is 2.
