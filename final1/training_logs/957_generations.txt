To determine how many biscuits Unique can make, we need to calculate how many 3-inch by 3-inch biscuits can fit into a 12-inch by 12-inch sheet of dough.

First, let's consider the length of the sheet. A 12-inch sheet can be divided into 4 equal parts because \(12 \div 3 = 4\). Similarly, the width of the sheet can also be divided into 4 parts.

Next, we need to consider how many biscuits we can fit along the length and the width of the sheet. Along the length, we can fit \(4\) biscuits, and along the width, we can fit \(4\) biscuits.

Therefore, the total number of biscuits that can be made is the product of these two divisions:

\(4 \text{ biscuits (along length)} \times 4 \text{ biscuits (along width)} = 16 \text{ biscuits}\)

So, Unique can make a total of \(16\) biscuits with this dough.

To determine how many biscuits Unique can make, we need to calculate how many 3-inch by 3-inch squares can fit into a 12-inch by 12-inch rectangle.

First, let's find out how many 3-inch squares can fit along one side of the dough sheet. Since each biscuit is 3 inches, 3 inches by 3 inches, and the dough sheet is 12 inches by 12 inches, we can fit:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ biscuits along one side} \]

Since the dough sheet is a square, the same number of biscuits will fit along the other side. Therefore, the total number of biscuits that can be made is:
\[ 4 \text{ biscuits} \times 4 \text{ biscuits} = 16 \text{ biscuits} \]

So, Unique can make 16 biscuits.

To determine how many square biscuits Unique can make from the 12 inches by 12 inches sheet of dough, we first need to calculate the area of both the dough sheet and each biscuit.

The area of the dough sheet is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area of the dough sheet} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 12 \, \text{inches} \times 12 \, \text{inches} = 144 \, \text{square inches} \]

The area of each biscuit is calculated by:
\[ \text{Area of each biscuit} = \text{side length} \times \text{side length} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 3 \, \text{inches} = 9 \, \text{square inches} \]

Next, we divide the area of the dough sheet by the area of each biscuit to find out how many biscuits can be made:
\[ \text{Number of biscuits} = \frac{\text{Area of the dough sheet}}{\text{Area of each biscuit}} = \frac{144 \, \text{square inches}}{9 \, \text{square inches}} = 16 \]

Since the calculations indicate 16 biscuits, but we should check if the dough sheet can accommodate 16 biscuits with their areas perfectly fitting together. Each biscuit has a 3x3 area, so it will take up 18 square inches if laid flat (since we have to account for the extra space around the biscuits in the 12x12 dough sheet).

If we take the 16 biscuits, we can fit 16 biscuits along each row and each column of the dough sheet, which means:
\[ \text{Number of biscuits that can fit} = \frac{12 \, \text{inches by 12 inches}}{\text{side length of one biscuit}} = \frac{12 \, \text{inches}}{3 \, \text{inches}} \times \frac{12 \, \text{inches}}{3 \, \text{inches}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 biscuits can fit perfectly on the dough sheet.

First, we need to find out how many biscuits can fit along one side of the dough sheet. Since each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches, we can fit one biscuit along the 12-inch side of the dough sheet (because \(12 \div 3 = 4\)). 

Now we calculate how many biscuits fit along the full side. Since she has a sheet of dough that is 12 inches by 12 inches, she can fit a 12 by 12 square.

The total number of biscuits that can be made is calculated by multiplying the number of biscuits along one side: \(4 \times 4 = 16\).

First, we need to determine how many biscuits can fit along one side of the dough sheet and how many can fit along the other side.

Given:
- The dough sheet is 12 inches by 12 inches.
- Each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches.

We can calculate the number of biscuits along one side by dividing the length of the dough sheet by the side length of a biscuit:

\[
\text{Number of biscuits along one side} = \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4
\]

Since the dough sheet is a square and each side is 12 inches, we can fit 4 biscuits on one side horizontally and 4 biscuits on the other side vertically. Therefore, the total number of biscuits can be found by multiplying these numbers:

\[
\text{Total number of biscuits} = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

So, Unique can make 16 biscuits with this dough.

To determine how many biscuits Unique can make, we need to consider the dimensions of both the dough sheet and the biscuits. The dough sheet is 12 inches by 12 inches, and each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches.

First, we calculate how many biscuits can fit along one side of the dough sheet. Since each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches, we can place 12/3 = 4 biscuits along one side of the dough sheet.

Similarly, since each biscuit is also 3 inches by 3 inches, we can place 12/3 = 4 biscuits along the other side of the dough sheet.

Therefore, the total number of biscuits that can be made is the product of the number of biscuits that can fit along one side and the number that can fit along the other side.

Total biscuits = 4 (biscuits along the 12-inch side) Ã— 4 (biscuits along the 12-inch side) = 16 biscuits.

So, Unique can make 16 biscuits with this dough.

To determine how many biscuits Unique can make, we need to calculate how many 3-inch by 3-inch squares fit into a 12-inch by 12-inch square. 

First, we calculate how many 3-inch squares fit along one side of the dough. Since each square is 3 inches by 3 inches, we divide the length of the dough by 3:
$$ \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{3 \text{ inches/square}} = 4 \text{ squares along one side} $$

Because the biscuits are square, the same number of squares will fit on the width of the dough as well:
$$ \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{3 \text{ inches/square}} = 4 \text{ squares along one side} $$

So, the total number of biscuits is the product of the number of squares along the length and the width:

To determine how many biscuits Unique can make with a 12 inches by 12 inches sheet of dough, each of which is 3 inches by 3 inches, we need to calculate the number of 3-inch by 3-inch squares that can fit within the 12-inch by 12-inch sheet.

First, we calculate the number of squares that fit along one side of the dough. Since each side of the dough is 12 inches, but each biscuit is only 3 inches, we divide 12 by 3 to get the number of biscuits that fit along one side:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, 4 biscuits would fit along each side of the dough sheet. Because the dough is a square, the number of biscuits that fit along each side will be the same. Therefore, we can fit:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, Unique can make 16 biscuits with this dough.

Next, we need to determine how many such sheets she needs to prepare that gives her 16 biscuits in total. Since each sheet produces exactly 16 biscuits, and she has a 12 inches by 12 inches sheet, she can prepare:

1 sheet

To determine how many biscuits Unique can make from the dough, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of biscuits that can be made in one row. Since each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches and the sheet of dough is 12 inches by 12 inches, we can fit:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{3 \text{ inches per biscuit}} = 4 \text{ biscuits per row}
   \]

2. Since the sheet is 12 inches by 12 inches and can be divided into 4 rows of biscuits, the total number of biscuits is:
   \[
   4 \text{ biscuits per row} \times 4 \text{ rows} = 16 \text{ biscuits}
   \]
This calculation is possible because 12 is a multiple of 3, ensuring that we can fit perfectly without any leftover dough.

To determine how many biscuits Unique can make, we need to calculate how many 3-inch square biscuits can fit along the 12-inch sides of the dough sheet.

First, let's calculate how many biscuits can fit along the 12-inch length of the dough. Since each biscuit is 3 inches long, we divide the length of the dough by the length of one biscuit:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{3 \text{ inches/biscuit}} = 4 \text{ biscuits} \]

Next, let's calculate how many biscuits can fit along the 12-inch width of the dough. Again, since each biscuit is 3 inches wide:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{3 \text{ inches/biscuit}} = 4 \text{ biscuits} \]

Thus, to find the total number of biscuits, we multiply the number of biscuits that can fit along the length by the number of biscuits that can fit along the width:

To determine how many square biscuits Unique can make with a 12-inch by 12-inch sheet of dough, we need to consider the dimensions of both the dough and the biscuits.

1. **Determine the available space per biscuit**: Since each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches, it occupies a 3-inch by 3-inch square on the dough.
2. **Calculate how many 3-inch squares fit along the 12-inch side**: The width of the dough is 12 inches. To find out how many 3-inch squares fit along this side, we divide:
   \[
   12 \text{ inches} \div 3 \text{ inches/square} = 4 \text{ squares}
   \]
3. **Calculate how many 3-inch squares fit along the other side**: Similarly, with a length of 12 inches, we divide:
   \[
   12 \text{ inches} \div 3 \text{ inches/square} = 4 \text{ squares}
   \]
4. **Calculate the total number of biscuits**: Since each side of the dough can hold 4 biscuits, the total number of biscuits is:
   \[
   4 \text{ biscuits/side} \times 4 \text{ biscuits/side} = 16 \text{ biscuits}
   \]

Therefore, Unique can make 16 biscuits with the dough.
