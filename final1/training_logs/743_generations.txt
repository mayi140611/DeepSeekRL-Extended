<reasoning>
The second rocket can travel twice the height of the first rocket, which means it can travel 500 ft x 2 = 1000 ft in the air.
The combined height of the two rockets is 500 ft + 1000 ft = 1500 ft.

<reasoning>
Let's calculate the height of the second rocket first. Since it can travel twice as high as the first rocket, its height is \(2 \times 500 = 1000\) feet.

Now, to find the combined height of the two rockets, we add their individual heights together. So, we have \(500 + 1000 = 1500\) feet.

However, this doesn't include the height gained from the first rocket's altitude. The first rocket is already 500 feet high, so we need to add this to our total. Therefore, the combined height of both rockets is \(1500 + 500 = 2000\) feet.

So, the combined height of the two rockets is \(2000\) feet.

John's first rocket can reach a height of 500 ft. The second rocket can reach twice this height, which means it can reach 2 * 500 = 1000 ft. To find the combined height of the two rockets, we need to add the heights of both rockets: 1000 ft + 500 ft = 1500 ft.

The first rocket can travel 500 ft in the air.
The second rocket can travel twice as high as the first, so it can travel \( 500 \times 2 = 1000 \) ft in the air.

To find the combined height of the two rockets, we add the heights together: \( 500 \text{ ft} + 1000 \text{ ft} = 1500 \text{ ft} \).

So, the combined height of the two rockets is 1500 feet.

The first rocket can travel 500 ft in the air. The second rocket can travel twice as high, which means it can reach \( 2 \times 500 \) ft. To find the combined height of the two rockets, we simply add the height of the first rocket to the height of the second rocket.

First rocket's height: 500 ft
Second rocket's height: \(2 \times 500 \) ft

Combined height = Height of the first rocket + Height of the second rocket

Let's calculate that.

#### GENERATION 11 RESPONSE ####

system
<reasoning>
To find the combined height of the two rockets, we first need to calculate the height of the second rocket. Since the second rocket can travel twice as high as the first rocket, we can multiply the height of the first rocket by 2. Once we have the height of the second rocket, we can add it to the height of the first rocket to find the combined height.

First rocket height: 500 ft.
Second rocket height: 500 ft * 2 = 1000 ft.

Combined height: 500 ft + 1000 ft = 1500 ft.

Therefore, the combined height of the two rockets is 1500 ft.

To determine the combined height of the two rockets, we start by noting the height of the first rocket, which is given as 500 feet. The second rocket can travel twice as high as the first rocket. Therefore, the height of the second rocket is:
\[ 500 \text{ ft} \times 2 = 1000 \text{ ft} \]

Next, we add the heights of the two rockets to find the combined height:
\[ 500 \text{ ft} + 1000 \text{ ft} = 1500 \text{ ft} \]

Therefore, the combined height of the two rockets is 1500 feet.
