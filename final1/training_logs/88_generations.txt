#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out how many geckos Brandon sold overall, we need to add the number of geckos he sold last year to the number he sold the year before.

Last year: 86 geckos
The year before: 2 * 86 = 172 geckos

Adding these together gives us the total:
86 + 172 = 258 geckos

So, Brandon sold a total of 258 geckos in the last two years.

system
To find out how many geckos Brandon has sold in the last two years, we need to calculate the number of geckos sold in the previous year and add it to the number sold last year.

1. Brandon sold 86 geckos last year.
2. The year before last, he sold twice the number of geckos as last year.
3. So, we multiply the number of geckos sold last year by 2 to find the number sold the year before:
   \[ 86 \times 2 = 172 \]
4. Now, to find the total number of geckos sold in the last two years, we add the geckos sold last year to the geckos sold the year before:
   \[ 86 + 172 = 258 \]

Therefore, Brandon has sold 258 geckos in the last two years.

system
To find out how many geckos Brandon sold in the last two years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many geckos Brandon sold the year before last year. Since he sold twice as many the year before last year as he did last year, we multiply 86 by 2:
86 * 2 = 172 geckos

2. Now we can find the total number of geckos sold in the last two years by adding the number of geckos sold last year to the number sold the year before last year:
86 + 172 = 258 geckos

So, Brandon sold a total of 258 geckos in the last two years.

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####

system
First, we determine how many geckos Brandon sold the year before last year. Since he sold twice as many geckos the year before last year as he did the year before last year, the number of geckos sold the year before last year is:

\[ 2 \times 86 = 172 \]

Next, we add the geckos sold the year before last year to the geckos sold last year to find the total number of geckos sold in the last two years:

\[ 86 + 172 = 258 \]

Thus, the total number of geckos sold in the last two years is:

\[
\boxed{258}

<reasoning>
To find out how many geckos Brandon has sold in the last two years, we need to determine the number of geckos he sold the year before last year and then add that to the number of geckos he sold last year.

Given:
- Brandon sold 86 geckos last year.
- He sold twice as many geckos the year before last year.

Calculation:
1. Calculate the number of geckos sold the year before last year: \( 2 \times 86 = 172 \) geckos.
2. Add the number of geckos sold last year and the year before last year: \( 86 + 172 = 258 \).

So, the total number of geckos sold in the last two years is 258.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out the total number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, determine how many geckos Brandon sold the year before last.
2. Then, add the number of geckos sold the year before the last to the number sold this year.

Step 1: 
Last year, Brandon sold 86 geckos.
The year before last, he sold twice that number.
So, we calculate twice 86:
\[ 2 \times 86 = 172 \]

Step 2:
This year, he sold 86 geckos.
Adding the number of geckos sold the year before the last to the number sold this year:
\[ 172 + 86 = 258 \]

Step 3:
We add the numbers from both steps:
\[ 86 + 258 = 344 \]

Therefore, Brandon sold a total of 344 geckos in the last two years.

To find out how many geckos Brandon sold in the last two years, we need to add the number of geckos he sold last year to the number he sold the year before.

Last year's sales: 86 geckos
Previous year's sales: 86 (last year's sales) * 2 = 172 geckos

Total sales in the last two years:
86 (last year's sales) + 172 (previous year's sales) = 258 geckos

To find out how many geckos Brandon has sold in the last two years, we need to calculate the number of geckos sold in the previous year, which is twice the number sold last year.

Given:
- Last year, Brandon sold 86 geckos.

Calculation for the previous year:
\[ 86 \times 2 = 172 \text{ geckos} \]

Adding the geckos sold last year and the previous year:
\[ 86 + 172 = 258 \text{ geckos} \]

Therefore, Brandon has sold a total of 258 geckos in the last two years.

To find out how many geckos Brandon has sold in the last two years, we first determine the number sold the year before. If he sold 86 geckos last year and twice that number the year before, we calculate:

\[
2 \times 86 = 172
\]

So, he sold 172 geckos the year before last.

Next, we add the number of geckos sold last year and the previous year to find the total sold in the two years:

\[
86 + 172 = 258
\]

Therefore, Brandon has sold a total of 258 geckos in the last two years.

To find the total number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years, we can start by calculating the number of geckos he sold the year before last year. Brandon sold twice as many geckos the year before last year as he did the year before last year, which means he sold \(2 \times 86\) geckos. Adding that to the number of geckos sold the year before last year, we will get the total number of geckos sold in the last two years.

Let's calculate it step by step.

First, calculate the number of geckos sold the year before last year:
\[ 2 \times 86 = 172 \]

Next, add the number of geckos sold last year to the number of geckos sold the year before last year:
\[ 172 + 86 = 258 \]

So, Brandon sold a total of 258 geckos in the last two years.
