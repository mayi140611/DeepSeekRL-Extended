Ian initially had $100. He paid $20 to Colin. Then, he paid twice as much to Helen as he had paid to Colin, which is $20*2 = $40. Next, he paid half as much to Benedict as he had paid to Helen, which is $40/2 = $20. In total, Ian paid: $20 (Colin) + $40 (Helen) + $20 (Benedict) = $80. Therefore, Ian has $100 - $80 = $20 left after paying off debts.
