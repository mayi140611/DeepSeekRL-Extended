###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Tom cannot afford a normal doctor, so he goes to a discount clinic that is 70% cheaper.   It takes two visits, though, instead of 1.   A normal doctor charges $200 for a visit.   How much money does he save?

<reasoning>
Tom's normal doctor's visit costs $200. The discount clinic is 70% cheaper, meaning the visit there costs 30% of what a regular doctor's visit would cost. 
So, the discounted price is $200 * 0.30 = $60. 
Tom visits the discount clinic twice, in total he gets charged $60 * 2 = $120.

A normal doctor's visit costs $200, so Tom saves $200 - $120 = $80.

To determine how much money Tom saves, we need to calculate the total costs for both the normal doctor and the discount clinic, and then find the difference between these costs.

1. **Cost with a normal doctor:**
   - The normal doctor charges $200 per visit.
   - Since Tom visits the normal doctor once, the total cost is \(200 \times 1 = 200\) dollars.

2. **Cost with the discount clinic:**
   - The discount clinic is 70% cheaper than the normal doctor.
   - First, calculate the discount amount: \(200 \times 0.70 = 140\) dollars.
   - Subtract the discount from the normal doctor's charge: \(200 - 140 = 60\) dollars.
   - Since Tom visits the clinic for two visits, the total cost is \(60 \times 2 = 120\) dollars.

3. **Total savings:**
   - Subtract the cost with the discount clinic from the cost with the normal doctor: \(200 - 120 = 80\) dollars.

Therefore, Tom saves $80 by using the discount clinic instead of the normal doctor.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The normal doctor charges $200 for a visit.
2. The discount clinic charges 70% of the normal doctor's price. So, the price at the clinic is $200 * 70% = $140 for a visit.
3. Tom needs two visits to the clinic, so the total cost at the discount clinic is $140 * 2 = $280.
4. A normal doctor charges $200 per visit, so for two visits, the total cost would be $200 * 2 = $400.
5. Therefore, the amount saved by going to the discount clinic is $400 - $280 = $120.

To determine how much money Tom saves, we need to compare the cost of visiting a normal doctor with the cost of visiting the discount clinic.

1. **Calculate the cost for a single visit to a normal doctor:**
   The normal doctor charges $200 for a visit.

2. **Calculate the cost for two visits to the discount clinic:**
   Since the discount clinic is 70% cheaper, it charges 30% of the normal doctor's rate for each visit. 
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } \$200 = 0.30 \times \$200 = \$60
   \]
   Therefore, the discount clinic charges:
   \[
   2 \times \$60 = \$120
   \]

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   The cost for a single visit to the discount clinic is $120, compared to $200 for a single visit to a normal doctor.
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for a normal doctor} - \text{Cost for two visits to the discount clinic}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \$200 - \$120 = \$80
   \]

Thus, Tom saves $80.

First, we need to calculate the cost of visiting a normal doctor. The normal doctor charges $200 for a visit. The discount clinic is 70% cheaper, which means it charges 30% of what the normal doctor charges since 100% - 70% = 30%. Therefore, the discounted cost for one visit to the discount clinic is $200 * 30/100 = $60.

Since Tom needs to make two visits, the total cost for the two visits at the discount clinic is $60 * 2 = $120.

Next, we calculate the savings by subtracting the total cost at the discount clinic from the cost of visiting a normal doctor. The normal doctor charges $200 for one visit and the discount clinic costs $120, so the total savings is $200 - $120 = $80.

Therefore, Tom saves $80.

To determine how much money Tom saves, we need to calculate the total cost of visits to both types of doctors and then find the difference.

First, calculate the cost of the visit to a normal doctor:
\[
\text{Cost of visit to normal doctor} = \$200
\]

Next, calculate the cost of two visits to the discount clinic. Since the discount clinic is 70% cheaper:
\[
\text{Discount} = 200 \times 0.70 = \$140
\]
\[
\text{Cost of two visits to the discount clinic} = 2 \times (200 - 140) = 2 \times 60 = \$120
\]

Now, find the savings:
\[
\text{Total cost of visit to normal doctor} = \$200
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of two visits to the discount clinic} = \$120
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = \$200 - \$120 = \$80
\]

Therefore, Tom saves \$80 by choosing the discount clinic instead of a normal doctor.

To calculate the amount of money Tom saves, we need to first determine the total cost of a visit to a normal doctor and a visit to the discount clinic, and then find the savings.

1. **Total cost of a visit to a normal doctor:**
   - A normal doctor charges $200 per visit.
   - So, the cost for one visit to a normal doctor is $200.

2. **Total cost of a visit to the discount clinic:**
   - The discount clinic is 70% cheaper, so it charges 30% of the normal doctor's price.
   - 30% of $200 is calculated as \(0.30 \times 200 = 60\).
   - Therefore, the cost for one visit to the discount clinic is $60.

3. **Total cost for two visits:**
   - For two visits, the total cost is \(60 + 60 = 120\).

4. **Total cost for one visit to a normal doctor:**
   - For one visit to a normal doctor, the total cost is $200.

5. **Amount of money saved:**
   - The difference between the cost of one visit to a normal doctor and the total cost for two visits to the discount clinic is \(200 - 120 = 80\).

So, Tom saves $80 by going to the discount clinic for two visits instead of one.

1. The cost of a single visit to a normal doctor is $200.
2. Since Tom goes to a discount clinic that is 70% cheaper, he only pays 30% of what a normal doctor charges for a visit.
3. To find the cost of a visit at the discount clinic, we calculate 70% of $200:
   \[
   0.70 \times 200 = 140
   \]
   So, Tom pays $140 for a visit at the discount clinic.

4. Since Tom has to make two visits instead of one at a normal doctor, the total cost for the visits to the discount clinic is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

5. The total cost of visiting a normal doctor for one visit is $200. Therefore, the total cost of visiting two normal doctor visits is:
   \[
   200 \times 2 = 400
   \]

6. The amount of money Tom saves by going to the discount clinic instead of a normal doctor is the difference between the cost of two normal doctor visits and the cost of two visits at the discount clinic:
   \[
   400 - 280 = 120

So, Tom saves $120.

First, we need to determine the cost of a visit to the discount clinic. Since the clinic is 70% cheaper than a normal doctor, the cost per visit to the clinic is 30% of the cost of a visit to a normal doctor.

Normal doctor charges: $200
Percentage off: 70%
Discount amount: $200 * 0.70 = $140
Discounted price: $200 - $140 = $60

Now we calculate the total cost of two visits to the discount clinic: 
Discounted price per visit: $60
Number of visits: 2
Total cost at discount clinic: $60 * 2 = $120

Next, we calculate the total cost of visiting a normal doctor once:
Normal doctor charges: $200 

Now we calculate the total amount of money Tom saves by visiting the discount clinic instead of a normal doctor:
Total cost at normal doctor: $200
Total cost at discount clinic: $120

So, Tom saves $80 by going to the discount clinic instead of a normal doctor.

Tom goes to a discount clinic that is 70% cheaper than a normal doctor. This means the clinic charges:
1. A 70% discount on the $200 visit fee for a normal doctor, which is \( 200 \times 0.70 = 140 \) dollars.
2. Therefore, the total cost at the discount clinic is \( 200 - 140 = 60 \) dollars.

Since he needs two visits, the total cost at the discount clinic is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) dollars.

The cost for one visit at a normal doctor would be $200. This means Tom saves \( 200 - 120 = 80 \) dollars.

\[ \text{Total cost for two visits to the normal doctor} = 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]
