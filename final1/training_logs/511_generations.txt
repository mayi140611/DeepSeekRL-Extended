To find out how many trips Elysse and her brother will make, we first need to calculate the total number of bags that both of them can carry per trip. Since each of them can carry 3 bags, in total, Elysse and her brother can carry \(3 + 3 = 6\) bags per trip.

Next, to determine how many trips are needed to carry 30 bags, we divide the total number of bags by the number of bags they can carry per trip. So, \(30 \div 6 = 5\).

Therefore, it will take them 5 trips to carry 30 bags of groceries.

To determine how many trips it will take Elysse and her brother to carry 30 bags of groceries, we start by calculating the total number of bags they can carry together in one trip.

Elysse can carry 3 bags of groceries per trip, and her brother can also carry 3 bags of groceries per trip. Therefore, together they can carry:
\[ 3 \text{ bags/trip} + 3 \text{ bags/trip} = 6 \text{ bags/trip} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trips are required to carry 30 bags. We divide the total number of bags by the number of bags they can carry per trip:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ bags}}{6 \text{ bags/trip}} = 5 \text{ trips} \]

So, it will take them 5 trips to carry 30 bags of groceries.

To determine the total number of bags Elysse and her brother can carry in one trip, we first calculate the combined capacity for one trip. Since Elysse and her brother each carry 3 bags, their combined capacity is \(3 + 3 = 6\) bags per trip.

Next, we need to find out how many trips are required to carry 30 bags. We do this by dividing the total number of bags by the combined capacity per trip:
\[
\frac{30 \text{ bags}}{6 \text{ bags/trip}} = 5 \text{ trips}
\]

Thus, it will take them 5 trips to carry 30 bags of groceries.

To determine the total number of trips Elysse and her brother will need to carry 30 bags of groceries, we start by calculating the total number of bags that one person can carry per trip.

Elysse can carry 3 bags per trip, and her brother can also carry 3 bags per trip. Therefore, together they can carry:
\[3 \text{ (bags per trip)} + 3 \text{ (bags per trip)} = 6 \text{ (bags per trip)}\]

Next, we need to find out how many trips they will need to carry 30 bags. We do this by dividing the total number of bags by the number of bags they can carry per trip:
\[30 \text{ bags} \div 6 \text{ bags per trip} = 5 \text{ trips}\]

Thus, it will take them 5 trips to carry 30 bags of groceries.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how many bags of groceries Elysse and her brother can carry together in one trip.
   - Elysse can carry 3 bags.
   - Her brother can also carry 3 bags.
   - Therefore, together they can carry \(3 + 3 = 6\) bags in one trip.

2. Next, we need to find out how many trips it will take for them to carry 30 bags of groceries.
   - Since they can carry 6 bags in one trip, we divide the total number of bags by the number of bags they can carry in one trip.
   - \(30 \div 6 = 5\)

So, it will take them 5 trips to carry 30 bags of groceries.
