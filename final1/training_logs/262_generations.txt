###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Jill and her brother Jack are going apple picking.  Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when both are full.  Jack's basket is full when it has 12 apples, but currently space for 4 more.  How many times could Jack's current number of apples fit into Jill's basket?

Initially, Jack's basket has space for 4 more apples. This means the total capacity of Jack's basket is \(12 + 4 = 16\) apples.

Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket. Therefore, the total capacity of Jill's basket is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) apples.

Jack's current number of apples is 4. To find out how many times Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket, we divide Jill's basket's capacity by Jack's current number of apples:

\[ \frac{32 \text{ apples}}{4 \text{ apples}} = 8 \]

system
Let's denote the capacity of Jack's basket as \( J \) and the capacity of Jill's basket as \( J_j \). Given that Jack's basket can hold 12 apples when full, we have:

\[
J = 12
\]

Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket, so:

\[
J_j = 2 \times J = 2 \times 12 = 24
\]

Currently, Jack's basket has 4 more apples than its capacity. Therefore, the number of apples in Jack's basket is:

\[
J_j - J = 24 - 12 = 12
\]

Now, we need to determine how many times Jack's current number of apples (12) can fit into Jill's basket (24). This can be calculated by dividing the capacity of Jill's basket by the number of apples in Jack's basket:

\[
\frac{J_j}{J_j - J} = \frac{24}{12} = 2
\]

First, we need to determine the capacity of Jill's basket. Since Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when both are full, Jack's basket has a capacity of 12 apples. Therefore, Jill's basket, which can hold twice as much, has a capacity of \(2 \times 12 = 24\) apples.

Now, to find out how many times Jill's current number of apples can fit into Jack's basket, we first need to determine how many apples Jack currently has. Jack's basket has 4 more apples space, so Jack currently has \(12 - 4 = 8\) apples.

To find out how many times Jill's current number of apples can fit into Jack's basket, we divide the capacity of Jack's basket by the number of apples Jack currently has:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ apples}}{8 \text{ apples}} = 3 \]

So, Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket 3 times.

Jack's basket is currently full with 12 apples but can hold 4 more, so it currently has 8 apples. Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket, so it can hold \(2 \times 12 = 24\) apples. We need to determine how many times Jack's current number of apples (8) can fit into Jill's basket (24).

To find this, we divide Jill's basket capacity by Jack's current number of apples:
\[ \frac{24}{8} = 3 \]

To determine how many times Jack's current number of apples could fit into Jill's basket, we need to first figure out how many apples are currently in Jack's basket and then compare that to the capacity of Jill's basket.

1. **Determine Jack's current number of apples:**
   - Jack's basket is full when it has 12 apples.
   - Jack's basket currently has 4 more apples than it would be full.

2. **Calculate the current number of apples in Jack's basket:**
   \[
   \text{Current apples} = \text{Full apples} - \text{Space left}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Current apples} = 12 - 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Determine Jill's basket capacity:**
   - Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when full.
   \[
   \text{Jill's capacity} = 2 \times \text{Jack's full capacity}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Jill's capacity} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

4. **Compare Jack's current number of apples to Jill's basket capacity:**
   - Jill's basket can hold 24 apples.
   - Jack's current basket has 8 apples.

5. **Calculate the number of times Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket:**
   \[
   \text{Number of times} = \frac{\text{Jill's capacity}}{\text{Jack's current apples}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of times} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]

Jack's basket is full when it has 12 apples, but it currently only has space for 4 more apples. Therefore, Jack's basket has 12 - 4 = 8 apples.

Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when both are full. Therefore, Jill's basket can hold 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

To find out how many times Jack's current number of apples could fit into Jill's basket, we divide Jill's basket capacity by Jack's current number of apples: 24 / 8 = 3 times.

Jack's basket can hold 12 apples when full. There are 4 more space in his current basket. So the current number of apples in Jack's basket is \(12 - 4 = 8\).

Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when both are full, so Jill's basket can hold \(12 \times 2 = 24\) apples.

To find out how many times Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket, we divide Jill's basket capacity by Jack's current number of apples in his basket:

Jack's basket has 12 apples and is missing 4, so it can hold 16 apples in total. Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's, which means Jill's basket can hold 2 * 16 = 32 apples.

To find out how many times Jack's current number of apples (12) fit into Jill's basket, we divide 32 by 12.

Let's denote the maximum number of apples Jack's basket can hold as \( J_{\text{max}} \) and the number of apples Jack currently has as \( J_{\text{current}} \). Similarly, let \( J_{\text{max}} \) for Jill's basket be denoted as \( J_{\text{Jill}} \) and \( J_{\text{current}} \) for Jill's basket be denoted as \( J_{\text{Jill current}} \).

We know from the problem statement that Jack's basket can hold 12 apples when full, so \( J_{\text{max}} = 12 \). Currently, Jack's basket has space for 4 more apples, meaning it currently contains \( J_{\text{current}} = 12 - 4 = 8 \) apples.

Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's when full, so \( J_{\text{Jill}} = 2 \times J_{\text{max}} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

To find out how many times Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket, we divide Jill's current number of apples by Jack's current number of apples:

\[
\frac{J_{\text{Jill current}}}{J_{\text{current}}} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
\]

So, Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket 3 times.

First, let's determine how many apples Jack's current basket is currently holding. Jack's basket has space for 4 more apples, and it can hold 12 when full. Therefore, since it has 4 more apples, it currently has \(12 + 4 = 16\) apples.

Next, we need to find out how much space Jill's basket has. Since Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when both are full, it has space for \(12 \times 2 = 24\) apples.

Now, to find out how many times Jack's current number of apples fit into Jill's basket, we divide the number of apples in Jill's basket by the number of apples Jack has:

\[
\frac{24}{16} = 1.5
