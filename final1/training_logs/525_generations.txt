On Monday, Mack writes for 60 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 30 minutes, so he writes \( \frac{60}{30} = 2 \) pages.

On Tuesday, Mack writes for 45 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 15 minutes, so he writes \( \frac{45}{15} = 3 \) pages.

On Wednesday, Mack writes 5 pages.

Adding up all the pages from Monday to Wednesday: \( 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \) pages.

To find out how many pages Mack writes, we will calculate the number of pages he writes each day and then sum them up.

For Monday:
Mack writes for 60 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 30 minutes.
\[ \text{Pages on Monday} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per page}} = 2 \text{ pages} \]

For Tuesday:
Mack writes for 45 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 15 minutes.
\[ \text{Pages on Tuesday} = \frac{45 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes per page}} = 3 \text{ pages} \]

For Wednesday:
Mack writes 5 pages.
\[ \text{Pages on Wednesday} = 5 \text{ pages} \]

Total pages from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 5 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 10 \text{ pages} \]

On Monday, Mack writes for 60 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 30 minutes. To find out how many pages he writes, we divide the time by the rate:

\[
60 \div 30 = 2 \text{ pages on Monday}
\]

On Tuesday, Mack writes 45 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 15 minutes. Similarly, to find out how many pages he writes, we divide the time by the rate:

\[
45 \div 15 = 3 \text{ pages on Tuesday}
\]

On Wednesday, Mack writes 5 pages directly:

\[
\text{Pages on Wednesday} = 5
\]

To find the total pages written from Monday to Wednesday, we sum the pages from each day:

\[
2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \text{ pages total from Monday to Wednesday}
\]
