#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let \( R \) be the number of books Roselyn gave to Rebecca, \( M \) be the number of books she gave to Mara, and \( B \) be the number of books Roselyn originally had. According to the problem, Rebecca received 40 books, so \( R = 40 \). Mara received three times as many books as Rebecca, so \( M = 3R = 3 \times 40 = 120 \).

After giving books to Rebecca and Mara, Roselyn remains with 60 books. Therefore, the total number of books she gave away is \( R + M = 40 + 120 = 160 \). Since Roselyn remains with 60 books, the total number of books she originally had is the sum of the books she gave away and the books she remains with:

\[
B = R + M + 60 = 40 + 120 + 60 = 220
\]

Thus, Roselyn had 220 books before she gave any away. The answer is:

To determine how many books Roselyn had initially, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, let's find out how many books Roselyn gave to Mara. According to the problem, Roselyn gave Mara three times as many books as she gave Rebecca. Since Rebecca received 40 books, Mara received:
   3 * 40 = 120 books

2. Next, we add the number of books given to Mara and Rebecca together:
   40 (Rebecca's books) + 120 (Mara's books) = 160 books

3. The problem states that after giving away these books, Roselyn is left with 60 books. Therefore, the total number of books Roselyn had initially is the sum of the books given to Mara and Rebecca and the books she has left:
   160 (given away) + 60 (left) = 220 books

So, Roselyn initially had 220 books.

Let's denote the number of books Roselyn gave Rebecca as \( R \). According to the problem, \( R = 40 \) books. Let \( B \) be the number of books Roselyn gave Mara. According to the problem, \( B = 3R \). Since Roselyn gave Mara three times as many books as she gave Rebecca, we have \( B = 3 \times 40 = 120 \) books.

The total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away is the sum of the books she gave to Mara and the books she gave to Rebecca. Therefore, the total number of books Roselyn had is:
\[ R + B = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away is \(\boxed{160}\).

To determine how many books Roselyn had before, let's break down the information given:

1. Roselyn gave Mara three times as many books as she gave Rebecca.
2. Roselyn remained with 60 books.
3. Rebecca received 40 books.

Let's denote the number of books Roselyn gave Rebecca as \( x \). According to the information, \( x = 40 \).

Since Mara received three times as many books as Rebecca, the number of books Roselyn gave Mara is \( 3x \).

The total number of books Roselyn gave away is \( x + 3x = 4x \). We know that \( x = 40 \), so:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Roselyn remained with 60 books, so the total number of books she had before giving anything away is:
\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Books given away} + \text{Books remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 160 + 60 = 220 \]

Therefore, the number of books Roselyn had before giving any away is 220.

To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Find out the total number of books given away:**
   - Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca, and Rebecca received 40 books.
   - Therefore, Mara received \(3 \times 40 = 120\) books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books given away:**
   - The total number of books given away is the sum of the books given to Mara and Rebecca, which is \(120 + 40 = 160\) books.

3. **Determine the total number of books before Roselyn gave any away:**
   - Roselyn has 60 books left after giving away 160 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books before giving any away was \(60 + 160 = 220\) books.

So, Roselyn had 220 books before she gave any away.

To determine the number of books Roselyn had before giving any away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- \( R_b \) as the number of books Rebecca received.
- \( R_m \) as the number of books Mara received.
- \( R_s \) as the number of books Roselyn had initially.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R_b = 40 \)
2. \( R_m = 3 \times R_b \)
3. After giving books to Mara, Rebecca, and herself, Roselyn remains with 60 books.

First, calculate the number of books Mara received:
\[
R_m = 3 \times 40 = 120
\]

Next, we know Rebecca and Roselyn together received:
\[
R_b + R_m = 40 + 120 = 160
\]

Since Roselyn remains with 60 books after giving away \( R_b + R_m \), the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away is:
\[
R_s + (R_b + R_m) = R_s + 160
\]

We know that after giving \( R_b + R_m \) books to Mara and herself, Roselyn remains with 60 books. Therefore:
\[
R_s + 160 = 60
\]

Solving for \( R_s \):
\[
R_s = 60 - 160 = -100
\]

This calculation seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate:

We know from the given that Roselyn remains with 60 books after the transactions. The total number of books she gave away is the sum of those given to Mara and Rebecca:
\[
R_b + R_m = 40 + 120 = 160
\]

Since Roselyn remains with 60 books, the initial number of books \( R_s \) must be greater than 160:
\[
R_s + 160 = 60 \implies R_s = 60 - 160 = -100 \quad (\text{which is not possible})
\]

Therefore, we should re-evaluate the logic:
\[
R_s = 60 + (R_b + R_m) = 60 + 160 = 220
\]

Thus, Roselyn had 220 books initially.

Let's reason through the problem step by step:

1. Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca.
2. Rebecca received 40 books.
3. Therefore, Mara received \(3 \times 40 = 120\) books.
4. Let's denote the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away as \( x \).
5. After giving away books, she remains with 60 books.
6. So, the equation representing the total books left with Roselyn after giving books away is:
\[ x - 40 - 120 = 60 \]
7. Simplify the equation:
\[ x - 160 = 60 \]
8. Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 60 + 160 \]

To determine how many books Roselyn had before, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rebecca received 40 books. According to the problem, Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca. Therefore, the number of books given to Mara is:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, the total number of books Roselyn gave away is the sum of the books given to Rebecca and the books given to Mara:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Let's denote the total number of books Roselyn had initially by \( B \). After giving away 160 books, Roselyn is left with 60 books. Therefore, the total number of books she had initially can be expressed as:
\[ B - 160 = 60 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:
\[ B - 160 = 60 \]
\[ B = 60 + 160 \]
\[ B = 220 \]

Thus, Roselyn had 220 books before she gave any away. The final answer is:

Given:
- Let \( R \) be the number of books Rebecca received.
- Let \( M \) be the number of books Mara received.
- Let \( B \) be the number of books Roselyn initially had.

From the problem, we know:
1. Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca.
2. Roselyn remains with 60 books.
3. Rebecca received 40 books.

We are to find the number of books Roselyn had initially (\( B \)).

Calculation steps:
1. Calculate the number of books Mara received:
   \[
   M = 3 \times R = 3 \times 40 = 120
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of books given to Mara and Rebecca:
   \[
   M + R = 120 + 40 = 160
   \]

3. Since Roselyn remains with 60 books after giving out 160 books:
   \[
   B - (M + R) = 60
   \]

4. Substitute \( M + R \) into the equation:
   \[
   B - 160 = 60 
   \]

5. Solve for \( B \):
   \[
   B = 60 + 160 
   \]
   \[
   B = 220

Conclusion:
Roselyn had \( 220 \) books before she gave any away.

Let's denote the number of books Rebecca received as \( R \). According to the problem, Rebecca received 40 books, so we have:

\[ R = 40 \]

Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca, so the number of books Mara receives is:

\[ \text{Books given to Mara} = 3R \]

The total number of books Roselyn has before giving any away is the sum of the books given to Rebecca and Mara:

\[ \text{Total books} = R + 3R = 4R \]

Now we know that after giving books to Rebecca and Mara, Roselyn remains with 60 books. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4R = 60 \]

To find \( R \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ R = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Now we know that Roselyn initially gave 15 books to Rebecca. Since we already calculated that Rebeccah received 40 books, it follows that:

\[ \text{Books given to Mara} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

To find the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away, we use the calculation we already derived:

\[ \text{Total books} = 4R = 4 \times 15 = 60 \]

So the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]
