Kenny played basketball for 10 hours.
He ran for twice as long as he played basketball, so he ran for \(2 \times 10 = 20\) hours.
He practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran, so he practiced on the trumpet for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) hours.

system
First, we need to determine how long Kenny ran. Since he ran for twice as long as he played basketball, and he played basketball for 10 hours, we calculate the running time as follows:

\[ \text{Running time} = 2 \times \text{Basketball time} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we find out how long Kenny practiced on the trumpet. He practiced for twice as long as he ran, so we calculate the practicing time as follows:

\[ \text{Practicing time} = 2 \times \text{Running time} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Kenny practiced on the trumpet for 40 hours last week.

\[ \text{Running time} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we find out how many hours he practiced on the trumpet. He practiced for twice as long as he ran, so:

\[ \text{Trumpet practicing time} = 2 \times \text{Running time} \]
\[ \text{Trumpet practicing time} = 2 \times 20 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Trumpet practicing time} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the time Kenny played basketball as \( B \), the time he ran as \( R \), and the time he practiced on the trumpet as \( T \).

Given:
- \( B = 10 \) hours
- \( R = 2B \)
- \( T = 2R \)

Now, we can calculate \( R \) and \( T \) step by step:

1. Calculate \( R \):
\[ R = 2B = 2 \times 10 = 20 \] hours

2. Calculate \( T \):
\[ T = 2R = 2 \times 20 = 40 \] hours

Therefore, Kenny practiced on the trumpet for 40 hours last week.
