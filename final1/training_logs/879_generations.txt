###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

For a project, a builder purchased 7 boxes of bolts with each box containing 11 bolts.  He purchased 3 boxes of nuts with each box containing 15 nuts. He ended up finishing the project 6 days early and with 3 bolts and 6 nuts left over. How many bolts and nuts did he use for the project?

<reasoning>
First, let's calculate the total number of bolts and nuts the builder purchased initially. 

For the bolts:
- There are 7 boxes and each contains 11 bolts. Therefore, the total number of bolts is \(7 \times 11 = 77\).

For the nuts:
- There are 3 boxes and each contains 15 nuts. Therefore, the total number of nuts is \(3 \times 15 = 45\).

The builder ended up with 3 bolts and 6 nuts left over, which means he used \(77 - 3 = 74\) bolts and \(45 - 6 = 39\) nuts for the project.

So, he used 74 bolts and 39 nuts for the project.

1. First, calculate the total number of bolts the builder bought: 
   \[
   7 \text{ boxes} \times 11 \text{ bolts/box} = 77 \text{ bolts}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of nuts the builder bought: 
   \[
   3 \text{ boxes} \times 15 \text{ nuts/box} = 45 \text{ nuts}
   \]

3. Determine the total number of unused bolts:
   \[
   45 \text{ nuts} - 3 \text{ leftover bolts} = 42 \text{ bolts used}
   \]

4. Determine the total number of unused nuts:
   \[
   77 \text{ bolts} - 6 \text{ unused boxes} \times 15 \text{ nuts/box} = 77 \text{ bolts} - 90 \text{ nuts} = 37 \text{ nuts used}
   \]

5. Finally, calculate the total number of bolts and nuts used:
   \[
   \text{Total bolts used} = 77 \text{ bolts} - 37 \text{ nuts} = 37 \text{ bolts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total nuts used} = 45 \text{ nuts} - 3 \text{ leftover nuts} = 42 \text{ nuts}
   \]

Therefore, the builder used 37 bolts and 42 nuts for the project.

Let's calculate the total amount of bolts and nuts purchased first:

- The builder bought 7 boxes of bolts with each box containing 11 bolts. So, the total number of bolts purchased is:
  7 boxes × 11 bolts/box = 77 bolts.

- The builder bought 3 boxes of nuts with each box containing 15 nuts. So, the total number of nuts purchased is:
  3 boxes × 15 nuts/box = 45 nuts.

Next, we need to account for the leftovers:

- The builder had 3 bolts left over after finishing the project, so he used:
  77 bolts - 3 bolts = 74 bolts.

- The builder had 6 nuts left over after finishing the project, so he used:
  45 nuts - 6 nuts = 39 nuts.

Adding the used bolts and nuts together:
74 bolts + 39 nuts = 113 parts used in the project.

To determine how many bolts and nuts the builder used for the project, we first need to calculate the total number of bolts and nuts purchased.

For the bolts:
- Each box contains 11 bolts.
- The builder bought 7 boxes, so the total number of bolts is \( 11 \times 7 = 77 \) bolts.

For the nuts:
- Each box contains 15 nuts.
- The builder bought 3 boxes, so the total number of nuts is \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \) nuts.

Next, we need to find out how many bolts and nuts were used for the project.

Since the builder finished the project 6 days early and had 3 bolts and 6 nuts left over, we need to subtract these leftovers from the total bought. Thus:
- The number of bolts used is \( 77 - 3 = 74 \) bolts.
- The number of nuts used is \( 45 - 6 = 39 \) nuts.

Therefore, the total number of bolts and nuts used for the project is \( 74 + 39 \).

1. **Calculate the total number of bolts purchased:**
   - Each box contains 11 bolts.
   - The builder purchased 7 boxes.
   - Total bolts = 7 boxes * 11 bolts/box = 77 bolts.

2. **Calculate the total number of nuts purchased:**
   - Each box contains 15 nuts.
   - The builder purchased 3 boxes.
   - Total nuts = 3 boxes * 15 nuts/box = 45 nuts.

3. **Determine the number of bolts and nuts used for the project:**
   - The project was completed 6 days early, so all the bolts and nuts were used.
   - Bolts left over = 3.
   - Bolts used = Total bolts - Bolts left over = 77 bolts - 3 bolts = 74 bolts.
   - Nuts left over = 6.
   - Nuts used = Total nuts - Nuts left over = 45 nuts - 6 nuts = 39 nuts.

So, the builder used 74 bolts and 39 nuts for the project.

To determine how many bolts and nuts were used for the project, we first need to calculate the total number of bolts and nuts that the builder purchased, as well as the number of bolts and nuts left over.

The builder purchased 7 boxes of bolts, with each box containing 11 bolts. Therefore, the total number of bolts is:
\[ 7 \times 11 = 77 \text{ bolts} \]

The builder purchased 3 boxes of nuts, with each box containing 15 nuts. Therefore, the total number of nuts is:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ nuts} \]

The builder ended up finishing the project 6 days early, which means he completed the project in \(30 - 6 = 24\) days.

The builder had 3 bolts and 6 nuts left over. Therefore, the number of bolts used for the project is:
\[ 77 - 3 = 74 \text{ bolts} \]

And the number of nuts used for the project is:
\[ 45 - 6 = 39 \text{ nuts} \]

The total number of bolts and nuts used for the project is:
\[ 74 + 39 = 113 \text{ items} \]

However, the question asks for the number of bolts and nuts used, and not the total items used. Since the builder used 3 bolts and 6 nuts, the total number of bolts and nuts used for the project is 9.

First, let's calculate the total number of bolts and nuts the builder had initially:

- Bolts: \(7 \text{ boxes} \times 11 \text{ bolts/box} = 77 \text{ bolts}\)
- Nuts: \(3 \text{ boxes} \times 15 \text{ nuts/box} = 45 \text{ nuts}\)

The builder finished 6 days early, which implies he used all the bolts and nuts before the deadline. He then had 3 bolts and 6 nuts left over, indicating he worked for \(77 + 45 - 3 - 6 = 111 - 9 = 102\) days more than the originally planned duration.

The project was completed 6 days early, which means he actually worked for \(102 - 6 = 96\) days. These 96 days are equivalent to \(96 \text{ days} \div 6 \text{ days/project} = 16 \text{ projects}\).

Since each project requires bolts and nuts in specific amounts, the total number of bolts used is \(16 \text{ projects} \times 11 \text{ bolts/project} = 176 \text{ bolts}\).

Similarly, the total number of nuts used is \(16 \text{ projects} \times 15 \text{ nuts/project} = 240 \text{ nuts}\).

Thus, the total number of bolts and nuts used for the project is \(176 \text{ bolts} + 240 \text{ nuts} = 416 \text{ bolts and nuts}\).

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of bolts purchased initially:
   - Each box contains 11 bolts, and 7 boxes were purchased.
   - Total bolts = \( 7 \text{ boxes} \times 11 \text{ bolts/box} = 77 \text{ bolts} \)

2. Calculate the total number of nuts purchased initially:
   - Each box contains 15 nuts, and 3 boxes were purchased.
   - Total nuts = \( 3 \text{ boxes} \times 15 \text{ nuts/box} = 45 \text{ nuts} \)

3. Account for the leftover materials:
   - He finished 6 days early, which means he didn't use these boxes.
   - He had 3 bolts and 6 nuts left over.

4. Calculate the number of bolts and nuts used in the project:
   - Bolts used = Total bolts - Leftover bolts = \( 77 \text{ bolts} - 3 \text{ bolts} = 74 \text{ bolts} \)
   - Nuts used = Total nuts - Leftover nuts = \( 45 \text{ nuts} - 6 \text{ nuts} = 39 \text{ nuts} \)

5. Sum up the total bolts and nuts used:
   - Total used = Bolts used + Nuts used = \( 74 + 39 = 113 \)

Therefore, he used a total of 113 bolts and nuts for the project.
