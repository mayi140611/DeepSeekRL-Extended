###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Josh and Anna were both born on August 17th, but in different years. To consolidate celebrations they also got married on August 17 when Josh turned 22. If today they're celebrating 30 years of marriage and their combined age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married, how old was Anna when they got married?

system
<reasoning>
Let's denote the marriage year as \( M \). We know that Josh was 22 years old when they got married. So, \( M = 22 \).

Today, they are celebrating 30 years of marriage, making the current year \( M + 30 = 22 + 30 = 52 \). This means that the marriage took place at the age of 22 and they have been married for 18 years from that date (since they celebrated 30 years of marriage today, but they have already spent 22 years together then).

Let's denote Anna's age when they got married as \( A \). Josh is currently \( 22 + 18 = 40 \) years old. Therefore, their combined age now is \( 40 + (22 + A) \).

According to the problem, their combined age now is \( 5 \) times what Josh's age was when they married. So, we set up the equation:
\[ 40 + (22 + A) = 5 \times 22 \]
\[ 40 + 22 + A = 110 \]
\[ 62 + A = 110 \]
\[ A = 110 - 62 \]
\[ A = 48 \]

So, Anna was 48 years old when they got married.

1. Josh was 22 when they got married. Today, 30 years after marriage, Josh is \(22 + 30 = 52\) years old.
2. Let Anna's age at the time of marriage be \(A\). Since the total age of Josh and Anna when they got married is \(A + 22\), today their combined age is \(A + 52\).
3. The problem states that Anna’s current age is exactly 5 times Josh’s age when they got married. Therefore, Anna's present age is \(5 \times 22 = 110\).
4. To find Anna’s age at the time of marriage, we subtract Josh’s age at the time of marriage from Anna’s current age: 
   \[A = 110 - 22 = 88.\]

So, Anna was 88 years old when they got married.

Let's denote:
- Josh's age when they got married as \( J \)
- Anna's age when they got married as \( A \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Josh and Anna were both born on August 17th, and they got married in the same year.
2. Today they are 30 years of marriage.
3. Their combined current age is 5 times Josh's age when they got married.

Let's convert these pieces of information into equations:
- Josh's age today: \( J + 22 \)
- Anna's age today: \( A + 22 \)
- Combined age today: \( (J + 22) + (A + 22) = J + A + 44 \)
- Their combined age is 5 times Josh's age when they got married: \( 5J \)

Since Josh and Anna got married on August 17th, and they are 30 years apart, we can calculate Josh's age when they got married:
\[ J + 22 = 30 \]
\[ J = 30 - 22 \]
\[ J = 8 \]

Now, using their combined ages:
\[ (J + A + 44) = 5J \]
\[ (8 + A + 44) = 5 \times 8 \]
\[ 52 + A = 40 \]
\[ A = 40 - 52 \]
\[ A = -12 \]

This step seems incorrect due to an arithmetic mistake. The correct calculation should be:
\[ 52 + A = 5 \times 8 \]
\[ 52 + A = 40 \]
\[ A = 40 - 52 \]
\[ A = -12 \]

Therefore, the calculated age of Anna would be:
\[ A = 40 - 52 \]
\[ A = -12 \]

This indicates an error in the initial assumptions or calculations. However, the provided problem setup seems to lead to a misinterpretation of the ages. It's essential to recheck the calculations and assumptions.

Upon reviewing:
- Combined age is \( 5J = 15 \) when they got married.
- Current age difference is 30 years, so combined age today is \( 15 + 30 = 45 \).
- Josh's current age is \( J + 22 = 8 + 22 = 30 \).
- Anna's current age is \( 45 - 30 = 15 \).
- Combined age today is \( 45 \), which is \( 5 \times 9 \).

Anna's age when they got married:
\[ J = 8 \]
\[ 8 + A = 15 \]
\[ A = 15 - 8 \]
\[ A = 7 \]

Thus, Anna was 7 years old when they got married.

Let's denote:
- \( J \) as Josh's age when they got married.
- \( A \) as Anna's age when they got married.
- \( J_{\text{married}} \) as Josh's age on the day they got married.
- \( M \) as today's date, which is 30 years after their wedding anniversary.

Given:
1. Josh and Anna turned 22 when Josh got married. Therefore, \( J_{\text{married}} = 22 \).
2. Their combined current age is exactly 5 times Josh's age at the time of marriage. Therefore, \( J + A = 5 \cdot J_{\text{married}} \), which means \( J + A = 5 \cdot 22 \).

Since today is 30 years later, we can express their combined ages as follows:
- Josh’s combined age today is \( J_{\text{married}} + 30 \).
- Anna’s combined age today is \( A + 30 \).

So, the equation becomes:
\[ J_{\text{married}} + 30 = 5 \cdot J_{\text{married}} \]
\[ A + 30 = 5 \cdot J_{\text{married}} \]

From the first equation:
\[ J_{\text{married}} + 30 = 5J_{\text{married}} \]
\[ 30 = 4J_{\text{married}} \]
\[ J_{\text{married}} = 7.5 \]

This result appears to be inconsistent with the realistic situation of their marriage, where ages are whole numbers. However, since they are celebrating 30 years of marriage, we need to solve with integer ages. The equations we have are:
\[ J_{\text{married}} = 22 \quad \text{and} \quad 22 + 30 = 5 \cdot 22 \]

This means their combined age today is:
\[ 22 + 30 = 55 \]

Since they are celebrating 30 years of marriage, Anna's age when they got married would be:
\[ 55 - 30 = 25 \]

So, Anna was 25 years old when they got married.

To solve this problem, let's denote the following:

- \( J \) as Josh's age when they got married.
- \( A \) as Anna's age when they got married.

We know from the problem statement that Josh was 22 when the marriage took place, so:
\[ J = 22 \]

The combination of Josh and Anna's ages adds up to 30 years today:
\[ J + A = 30 \]

We are also given that their combined age when they got married is exactly 5 times what Josh’s age was when they got married at:
\[ J + A = 5 \times J \]

Let's substitute the value of \( J \) into the combined age equation:
\[ 22 + A = 5 \times 22 \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 22 + A = 110 \]
\[ A = 110 - 22 \]
\[ A = 88 \]

So, Anna must have been 88 years old when they got married.

Now let's calculate Josh’s age at the time of marriage:
\[ J = 22 \]

Since \( J + A = 30 \):
\[ 22 + A = 30 \]
\[ A = 8 \]

Let's verify these values to make sure everything checks out. If Anna was 88 years old when they got married, then her age when Josh was 22 would simply be \( 88 - 22 = 66 \). This matches the condition stated in the problem that their combined age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they got married at:
\[ 22 + 88 = 5 \times 22 = 110 \]

Therefore, Anna was indeed 88 years old when they got married.

Let's denote the year Anna was born as \( A \) and the year Josh was born as \( J \). Since they both turned 22 on August 17th, the difference in their ages at that time was:

\[ 22 - (A - J) = 22 - (2022 - A) = 22 - 2022 + A = A - 1999 \]

When they get married, the difference in their ages becomes:

\[ 22 + (A - J) = 22 + (2022 - A) = 22 + 2022 - A = 2044 - A \]

Now, we are given that today they are celebrating 30 years of marriage, and Anna's age at that time is equal to 5 times Josh's age when they got married. Therefore, Anna's age today is:

\[ 22 + 30 = 52 \]

We can now set up the following equation based on their ages:

\[ 22 + 30 = 5(A - J) \]
\[ 52 = 5(A - J) \]

Since the difference in their ages when they got married is:

\[ 22 + (A - J) = A - 1999 \]

And since today's difference in their ages is:

\[ 22 + 30 = 52 \]

We have:

\[ 52 = A - 1999 \]
\[ A = 2044 \]

Therefore, Anna was \( 2044 - 1999 = 45 \) years old when they got married.

To solve this problem, let's assume Anna was \(A\) years old when they got married. We know that Josh was 22 at the time of their marriage.

So, at the time of marriage:
- Josh's age = \(22\)
- Anna's age = \(A\)

Since they are celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary today, we know that they have been married for \(30 - 22 = 8\) years.

Today, Josh's age is \(22 + 8 = 30\).

Thus, their combined age today is \(30 + A\) plus Anna's age in the year they got married, \(A\).

According to the problem, their combined age is 5 times what Josh's age was when they got married. Hence, \(30 + A = 5 \times 22\).

Solving for \(A\):
\[ 30 + A = 110 \]
\[ A = 110 - 30 \]
\[ A = 80 \]

Let's denote the year they married as \( A \). Since they got married on August 17 when Josh was 22, we can write:

So,

It means they got married on 2000. Today is 2023, so they've been married for:
\[ 2023 - 44 = 1979 \text{ years} \]

Let's denote Anna's current age as \( Y \) and Josh's current age as \( X \). According to the problem, the combined age of Josh and Anna today is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married:
\[ X + Y = 5 \times 66 = 330 \]

Since Anna was born in 1978:
\[ Y = 2023 - 1978 = 45 \]

The combined age equation is:

Let's denote Josh's age when they married as \( J = 22 \) and Anna's age when they married as \( A \).

Since Anna was born on August 17th in a different year, we can express her current age as \( A_{now} = A + 30 \).

When they got married, Josh was 22, so his age at the time of marriage was simply \( J = 22 \).

The combined age of Josh and Anna today is \( 22 + A_{now} = 5 \times 22 = 110 \).

So, \( 22 + A_{now} = 110 \Rightarrow A_{now} = 110 - 22 = 88 \).

Since Anna's current age is \( 88 \), and she was \( A \) years old when they got married, we have \( A + 30 = 88 \).

1. To solve this problem, we start by defining variables for Josh's and Anna's ages at marriage and today.
    Let \( J_m \) be Josh's age when they got married (22 years old).
    Let \( A_m \) be Anna's age when they got married.
    We also define \( J_0 \) as Josh's current age and \( A_0 \) as Anna's current age.
    Given that they are celebrating 30 years of marriage, we can express their ages today as:
    \( J_0 = J_m + 30 = 22 + 30 = 52 \) years old.
    \( A_0 = A_m + 30 = A_m + 30 \) years old.
    
2. They are celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary today, which means they were married for \( 30 \times 2 = 60 \) years ago.
    This implies \( J_m = 22 \) and \( A_m = 22 - 30 \).
    Thus, \( A_m = 22 - 30 = -10 \).

3. Also, their combined age today is 5 times Josh's age when they got married.
    So:
    \( J_0 + A_0 = 5 \times J_m \).
    Substituting \( J_0 = 52 \), and \( J_m = 22 \):
    \( 52 + A_0 = 5 \times 22 \).
    \( 52 + A_0 = 110 \).
    Solving for \( A_0 \):
    \( A_0 = 110 - 52 \).
    \( A_0 = 58 \).

4. Since \( A_0 \) is Anna's age when they got married:
    \( Anna's \ age \ m = A_m \).
    But we already calculated \( A_m = 22 - 30 \).
    
5. We have \( A_m = 22 - 30 \) and \( A_m = -10 \)

Therefore, Anna was \( -10 \) years old when they got married.

To solve this problem, we need to determine Anna's age when they got married given the following information:

- They got married on August 17th when Josh was 22 years old.
- They are celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary.
- Their combined age today is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married.

First, let's calculate Josh's current age:
- Since they got married when Josh was 22 and they are celebrating their 30th anniversary, Josh is currently \( 22 + 30 = 52 \) years old.

Next, let's calculate their combined age today:
- The sum of their current ages is \( 52 + 52 = 104 \) years.

According to the problem, their combined age today is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married:
- Therefore, \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \).

However, we calculated their combined age to be 104, which indicates an inconsistency. This suggests that we need to re-evaluate our understanding of the problem or the reference point.

Let's reconsider the reference point for Anna's age:
- The reference point for Anna's age is Josh's age when they got married, which is 22 years old.

If their combined age today is 104, Anna's age can be found by subtracting Josh's age from their combined age:
- Anna's age when they got married = \( 104 - 52 = 52 \).

Thus, Anna was 52 years old when they got married.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the year Anna was born,
- \( y \) as the year Josh was born (which we know is in 1999),
- \( m \) as the year they got married, when Josh was 22 years old.

Since they married on August 17, their marriage would fall on August 17, 1999 + (22 years - x), which means \( m = 1999 + 22 - x \).

Now, let's calculate their ages 30 years after their marriage:
- Josh's age: \( (1999 + 22 - x) + 30 = 2041 - x \)
- Anna's age: \( (1999 + x) + 30 = 2029 + x \)

According to the problem, Anna's age is 5 times Josh's age when they got married:
\[ 5 \times (2041 - x) = 2029 + x \]

Solving this equation:

1. \( 5 \times (2041 - x) = 2029 + x \)
2. \( 10205 - 5x = 2029 + x \)
3. \( 10205 - 2029 = 6x \)
4. \( 8176 = 6x \)
5. \( x = 1362.67 \)

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, there seems to be an error in the interpretation or problem setup. However, given the context and that the ages must be integers, we should verify the logic:

Anna would turn \( x \) years old in the year where they got married. From the equations, we see a discrepancy. Instead, let's directly solve for \( x \) without complicating the steps.

Now, let's find out how old Anna was when they married:
- Anna's age at marriage = \( 1999 + x \)

Let's solve the equations:
- \( 5 \times (2041 - x) = 2029 + x \) yields an integer age.

Once we rectify the calculation, Anna's age when they got married should be:

\[ 2041 - x - 22 = 2019 - x \]

To satisfy all conditions, we should find a value for \( x \) such that:

\[ 5 \times (2041 - x) = 2029 + x \]

\[ 20714 - 5x = 2029 + x \]

\[ 20714 - 2029 = 6x \]

\[ 18685 = 6x \]

\[ x = 3114.16666667 \]

Since \( x \) must be an integer, we reassess our logic. Anna would be 3114 + x years old at marriage; solving:

\[ x = 1999 - 22 = 1977 \]

Therefore:
Anna's age when they married: \( 1999 + 1977 = 3976 \).

Anna was 3976 years old when they got married.
