Discount on each gallon of milk = $3 - $2 = $1
Discount on each box of cereal = $1

Total savings on 3 gallons of milk = 3 x $1 = $3
Total savings on 5 boxes of cereal = 5 x $1 = $5

Total savings = $3 + $5 = $8

To determine the total savings from discounts on 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal, we need to calculate the total cost of these items before and after the discounts, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 3 gallons of whole milk before any discounts:
- The original price of 3 gallons of milk is \(3 \times $3 = $9\).

After applying the discount of $1 per gallon:
- The new price for each gallon of milk is \( $3 - $1 = $2\).
- Therefore, the total cost for 3 gallons after the discount is \(3 \times $2 = $6\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of 5 boxes of cereal before any discounts:
- The price of one box of cereal is $1.
- Therefore, the total cost for 5 boxes of cereal is \(5 \times $1 = $5\).

Now, to find the total cost of these items both before and after the discount:
- Before the discount: 3 gallons of milk at $9 and 5 boxes of cereal at $5, totaling \( $9 + $5 = $14 \).
- After the discount: 3 gallons of milk at $6 and 5 boxes of cereal at $5, totaling \( $6 + $5 = $11\).

The savings from discounts is the difference between the cost before the discount and the cost after the discount:
- Savings = $14 - $11 = $3.

Therefore, the total savings via discounts is $3.

The discount on a gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1. So the total discount on 3 gallons of whole milk is $1 x 3 = $3. The discount on a box of cereal is $1 so the total discount on 5 boxes of cereals is $1 x 5 = $5. The discount on milk and cereal is $3 + $5 = $8.

The cost of 3 gallons of whole milk before discount is 3 gallons * $3/gallon = $9. After discount, it becomes $2/gallon, so the total cost for 3 gallons of whole milk is 3 gallons * $2/gallon = $6.
The cost of 5 boxes of cereal before discount is 5 boxes * $1/box = $5. After discount, each box is sold at $1.00 - $0.50 = $0.50. So the total cost for 5 boxes of cereal is 5 boxes * $0.50/box = $2.50.
The total cost of 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $6 + $2.50 = $8.50.
Therefore, the amount you will save via discounts is $9 + $5 - $8.50 = $7.50.

The discount on the whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. The discount on the cereal is $1 per box.

So, for 3 gallons of milk you'd save $1 x 3 = $3. And for 5 boxes of cereal you'd save $1 x 5 = $5.

So in total, you'd save $3 + $5 = $8.

To calculate the total savings from discounts, we need to first determine the savings on milk and then on cereal separately and finally add them together.

For milk, the savings can be calculated by subtracting the current price from the original price.
Cost of 3 gallons of whole milk at original price = 3 gallons * $3/gallon = $9

Cost of 3 gallons of whole milk at discounted price = 3 gallons * $2/gallon = $6

Total savings on milk = Original price - Discounted price = $9 - $6 = $3

For cereal, the savings can be calculated by subtracting the discounted price from the original price.
Cost of one box of cereal at original price = $5, Discounted price = $4

Total saving on cereal = Original price - Discounted price = $5 - $4 = $1

Total savings = Savings on milk + Savings on cereal = $3 + $1 = $4

So, the total savings via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $4.

To determine how much you will save via discounts, we need to calculate the total savings for each item and then sum them up.

For the milk:
- Original price: $3 per gallon
- Sale price: $2 per gallon
- Total milk purchase: 3 gallons
- Savings on milk: (Original price - Sale price) * Total milk purchase
= ($3 per gallon - $2 per gallon) * 3 gallons
= $1 per gallon * 3 gallons
= $3

For the cereal:
- Original price: $5 per box (assuming $5 is a reasonable price)
- Discount: $1 per box
- Total cereal purchase: 5 boxes
- Savings on cereal: Original price - Discount per box * Total cereal purchase
= $5 per box - $1 per box * 5 boxes
= $5 - $5
= $0

Now, add the savings on milk and cereal to find the total savings.

Total savings = Savings on milk + Savings on cereal
= $3 + $0
= $3

Therefore, you will save $3 via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.

To calculate the total savings, we need to find the total cost without discounts and the total cost with discounts for the given quantities.

1. **Cost without discounts**:
   - For milk: 3 gallons * $3/gallon = $9
   - For cereal: 5 boxes * $1/box = $5
   - Total cost without discounts: $9 + $5 = $14

2. **Cost with discounts**:
   - For milk: 3 gallons * $2/gallon = $6
   - For cereal: 5 boxes * $0/box = $0 (since there's no discount per box, all boxes are free)
   - Total cost with discounts: $6 + $0 = $6

3. **Total savings**:
   - Savings = Total cost without discounts - Total cost with discounts
   - Savings = $14 - $6 = $8

To determine the total savings, let's break down the calculations for each item separately.

For milk:
1. Original price for 1 gallon = $3
2. Discounted price for 1 gallon = $2
3. Savings per gallon = Original price - Discounted price
   Savings per gallon = $3 - $2 = $1

For cereal:
1. Discounted price for 1 box = $1
2. Savings per box = Discounted price

For 3 gallons of milk:
3 gallons × $1 per gallon = $3

For 5 boxes of cereal:
5 boxes × $1 per box = $5

Total savings:
$3 (for milk) + $5 (for cereal) = $8

Therefore, the total savings via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $8.

To determine how much you will save via discounts, we need to calculate the total cost before the discount and the total cost after the discount, then subtract the latter from the former.

1. Calculate the total cost of 3 gallons of whole milk before the discount:
   - Cost per gallon of whole milk: $3
   - Number of gallons: 3
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 3 \text{ gallons} \times \$3 \text{ per gallon} = \$9
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost of 5 boxes of cereal after the discount:
   - Original price per box: $10
   - Discount per box: $1
   \[
   \text{Discounted price per box} = \$10 - \$1 = \$9
   \]
   - Number of boxes: 5
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 5 \text{ boxes} \times \$9 \text{ per box} = \$45
   \]

3. Calculate the total savings:
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = \text{Total cost after discount} - \text{Total cost before discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = \$45 - \$9 = \$36

Reasoning:
To determine how much you will save via discounts, we need to calculate the total savings for both the milk and the cereal.

First, let's calculate the savings on the whole milk:
- Normally, a gallon of whole milk costs $3.
- Now, it is sold at $2, which is a discount of $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon.
- If you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, the total discount is 3 gallons * $1/gallon = $3.

Next, let's calculate the savings on the cereal:
- Normally, a box of cereal costs $1.
- Now, there is a $1 discount on each box.
- If you buy 5 boxes of cereal, the total discount is 5 boxes * $1/box = $5.

Now, we can calculate the total savings:
- Total savings on milk = $3
- Total savings on cereal = $5
- Total savings = $3 + $5 = $8

Answer:
You will save $8 via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.

To determine the total saving from discounts when buying 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal, we first need to calculate the savings for each item separately and then add them together.

Given:
- A gallon of whole milk normally costs $3 but is now sold at $2.
- A box of cereal is sold at a discount of $1.

Calculations:
1. Savings for milk:
   \[
   \text{Savings for milk} = \text{Original price - Sale price} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. Savings for cereal:
   \[
   \text{Savings for cereal} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

Total savings:
\[
\text{Total savings} = \text{Savings for milk} + \text{Savings for cereal} = 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount you will save via discounts when you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is 2 dollars.
