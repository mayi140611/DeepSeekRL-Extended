###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Wickham is throwing a huge Christmas party. He invites 30 people. Everyone attends the party, and half of the guests bring a plus one (one other person). He plans to serve a 3-course meal for the guests. If he uses a new plate for every course, how many plates does he need in total for his guests?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
He invited 30 people, and half of them, which is 15 people, bring a plus one. So in total, there are 30 + 15 = 45 people attending the party. Since each person will use a new plate for every course, Wickham will need a new plate for each guest for each of the 3 courses. So he will need 45 guests * 3 courses = 135 plates.

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####

system
Each guest plus one brings a plate to the party, so each guest has 2 plates. There are 30 guests, and half of them bring a plus one, which is 30 / 2 = 15 guests with a plus one. The remaining guests, which is 30 - 15 = 15 guests, do not bring a plus one. Each of these 15 guests has 1 plate, so there are 15 plates needed for the non-plus one guests. In total, Wickham needs 15 (for the guests without a plus one) + 15 (for the guests with a plus one) = 30 plates for everyone. There are 3 courses, so Wickham needs 30 plates * 3 = 90 plates.

There are 30 guests, and 3/4 of them bring a plus one, which totals to (30/4) * (3/4) = 22.5. Since the number of people should be a whole number, we'll round this up to 23.

There are 30 guests + 23 guests they bring a plus one, which is (30+23) * 2 = 106 plates.

Each guest will have three plates: one for each course of the meal. 
There are a total of 30 guests, 30 guests plus one plus one for each guest brings an added guest, for a total of \(30 + 30\) plus 10 for the plus ones. 
So, the total number of plates he needs is \(30 \times 3 + 10 \times 3 = 90 + 30 = 120\).

Each guest, including those who bring a plus one, will need a plate for each course of the meal. Since there are 30 guests and half of them bring a plus one, there are \(30 / 2 = 15\) guests with a plus one. Therefore, there are \(30 + 15 = 45\) guests in total.

Since each guest will use a new plate for each course, and there are 3 courses, the total number of plates needed is \(45 \times 3 = 135\).
