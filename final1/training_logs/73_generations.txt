It is Roger’s turn to provide a snack for the baseball team after the game and he has decided to bring trail mix. The trail mix comes in packs of 6 individual pouches. Roger has 13 members on his baseball team, plus 3 coaches and 2 helpers. How many packs of trail mix does he need to buy?

system
To determine how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of people who will be getting the snack. This includes Roger, his 13 baseball team members, his 3 coaches, and his 2 helpers. 

Total number of people = Roger + Team Members + Coaches + Helpers
Total number of people = 1 + 13 + 3 + 2
Total number of people = 19

Each pack of trail mix contains 6 individual pouches. Therefore, to find out how many packs Roger needs, we divide the total number of people by the number of pouches per pack:

Number of packs needed = Total number of people / Number of pouches per pack
Number of packs needed = 19 / 6

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Rounding 19/6 up, we get 3.17, which rounds up to 4.

Roger needs to buy 4 packs of trail mix to ensure every person gets a snack.

First, let's determine the total number of individuals who need snacks: Roger's team members, coaches, and helpers. Total individuals = 13 team members + 3 coaches + 2 helpers = 18 individuals.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of trail mix are required to provide enough pouches for everyone. Since each pack contains 6 pouches, we divide the total number of individuals by the number of pouches per pack: 18 individuals ÷ 6 pouches per pack = 3 packs.

Therefore, Roger needs to buy 3 packs of trail mix.

To determine how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of individuals who will be consuming the trail mix. This includes Roger's team members, coaches, and helpers.

- Team members: 13
- Coaches: 3
- Helpers: 2

Total number of individuals:

13 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 2 (helpers) = 18 individuals

Trail mix comes in packs of 6 individual pouches. To find out how many packs Roger needs to buy, we divide the total number of individuals by the number of pouches in one pack:

18 ÷ 6 = 3 packs

Therefore, Roger should buy 3 packs of trail mix.

To find out how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of people who will be eating the trail mix. This includes the 13 members of the baseball team, 3 coaches, and 2 helpers, which adds up to 18 people.

Next, we need to consider that each person will get one pouch of trail mix, which means we need 18 pouches in total if we want to give each person one.

Since trail mix is sold in packs of 6 individual pouches, we need to determine how many packs are required for 18 pouches. We can do this by dividing the total number of pouches by the number of pouches per pack:

18 pouches ÷ 6 pouches/pack = 3 packs

Therefore, Roger needs to buy 3 packs of trail mix to ensure there are enough pouches for everyone.

To determine how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of people who will consume the trail mix. This includes Roger, his 13 team members, 3 coaches, and 2 helpers.

The total number of people is:
\[ 1 \text{ (Roger)} + 13 \text{ (team members)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} + 2 \text{ (helpers)} = 20 \text{ people} \]

Since each pack of trail mix contains 6 pouches, we need to determine how many packs are required for 20 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the number of pouches per pack:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{6 \text{ pouches per pack}} = 3.3333 \]

Since Roger cannot buy a fraction of a pack, he must round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 4 packs of trail mix.

To determine how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of people involved.

Roger + Members = 13
Roger + Coaches = 3
Roger + Helpers = 2

Total number of people = 13 + 3 + 2 = 18

Each pack contains 6 individual pouches.

To find out how many packs Roger needs, we divide the total number of people by the number of pouches per pack:

To find out how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy, we must first figure out how many individual pouches he needs. We start by adding up the total number of people who will be enjoying the trail mix. This includes Roger (the player), plus his 13 members on the baseball team, 3 coaches, and 2 helpers. So the total number of people is:

\[1 + 13 + 3 + 2 = 19\]

Since each pack contains 6 individual pouches, we need to divide the total number of pouches needed by the number of pouches per pack:

\[19 \div 6 = 3 \frac{1}{6}\]

Since you can't purchase a fraction of a pack of trail mix, Roger needs to round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough. Therefore, Roger needs to buy 4 packs of trail mix. 

So, Roger needs to buy \boxed{4} packs of trail mix.
