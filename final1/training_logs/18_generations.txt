system
To determine the total hours Roque takes to get to and from work a week, we need to consider both his walking and biking trips.

First, let's calculate the total time he spends walking:
- He walks to work once a day.
- He walks from work once a day.
- This means he walks twice a day.

Since he walks three times a week, we multiply the daily walking time by the number of days per week:
\[ 3 \text{ days a week} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he spends biking:
- He rides his bike to work once a day.
- He rides his bike from work once a day.
- This means he bikes twice a day.

Since he rides his bike twice a week, we multiply the daily biking time by the number of days per week:
\[ 2 \text{ days a week} \times 1 \text{ hour/day} = 2 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we add the total walking time to the total biking time to find the total time spent traveling to and from work each week:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} + 2 \text{ hours/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, Roque takes a total of 8 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking.

To calculate the total time Roque takes to get to and from work a week with walking and biking, we need to consider the time spent walking and biking separately and then add them together.

1. Calculate the weekly walking time:
   - Time to walk to work: 2 hours
   - Time to walk back home: 2 hours
   - Total time for walking to and from work: 2 hours (to work) + 2 hours (back home) = 4 hours
   - Number of times per week: 3
   - Total walking time in a week: 4 hours/week * 3 = 12 hours

2. Calculate the weekly biking time:
   - Time to bike to work: 1 hour
   - Time to bike back home: 1 hour
   - Total time for biking to and from work: 1 hour (to work) + 1 hour (back home) = 2 hours
   - Number of times per week: 2
   - Total biking time in a week: 2 hours/week * 2 = 4 hours

3. Add the total walking and biking times:
   - Total time walking in a week: 12 hours
   - Total time biking in a week: 4 hours
   - Total time to get to and from work a week: 12 hours (walking) + 4 hours (biking) = 16 hours

Therefore, Roque takes a total of 16 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking.

Let's calculate the total time Roque takes to get to and from work:

- Walking daily: 2 hours per trip * 2 trips (to and from) = 4 hours per day
- Walking weekly: 4 hours per day * 5 workdays = 20 hours

- Biking daily: 1 hour per trip * 2 trips (to and from) = 2 hours per day
- Biking weekly: 2 hours per day * 5 workdays = 10 hours

Adding both methods:

Total weekly time = 20 hours (walking) + 10 hours (biking) = 30 hours

Therefore, Roque takes a total of 30 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking.

To calculate the total time Roque spends on his commute, we first determine the time he spends walking and biking:

- Time spent walking to and from work: 2 hours per trip * 3 trips a week = 6 hours.
- Time spent biking to and from work: 1 hour per trip * 2 trips a week = 2 hours.

Then we add these times together:

Total commute time = Time walking + Time biking
Total commute time = 6 hours + 2 hours = 8 hours.

Therefore, the answer is 8 hours.

To determine the total number of hours Roque takes to get to and from work a week with walking and biking, we need to calculate the time spent on each mode of transportation separately and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time Roque spends walking to and from work per week:
- Time spent walking to/from work per day = 2 hours (to work) + 2 hours (back) = 4 hours per day.
- Time spent walking to and from work per week = 4 hours/day × 3 days/week = 12 hours/week.

Next, we calculate the time Roque spends biking to and from work per week:
- Time spent biking to/from work per day = 1 hour (to work) + 1 hour (back) = 2 hours per day.
- Time spent biking to and from work per week = 2 hours/day × 2 days/week = 4 hours/week.

Now, we sum the time spent walking and biking per week:
- Total time spent per week = Time spent walking + Time spent biking = 12 hours/week + 4 hours/week = 16 hours/week.

Therefore, the total number of hours Roque takes to get to and from work a week with walking and biking is 16 hours.

To calculate the total time Roque takes to get to and from work a week with walking and biking, we need to multiply the time it takes for each mode of transportation by the frequency of the activity for each mode of transportation.

For walking:
Time per trip = 2 hours
Frequency per week = 3 trips
Total walking time per week = 2 hours/trip * 3 trips/week = 6 hours/week

For biking:
Time per trip = 1 hour
Frequency per week = 2 trips
Total biking time per week = 1 hour/trip * 2 trips/week = 2 hours/week

Now, we add the total walking time to the total biking time to get the total time spent on transportation per week:

Total time spent on transportation per week = 6 hours/week (walking) + 2 hours/week (biking) = 8 hours/week

Therefore, Roque takes a total of 8 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking.

To calculate the total time Roque spends commuting to and from work in a week, we need to break down the time spent walking and biking separately.

First, let's calculate the time spent walking to and from work:
Roque walks to and from work three times a week.
Walking time once = 2 hours (one way)
Total walking time a week = 2 hours/station * 3 stations = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent biking to and from work:
Roque bikes to and from work twice a week.
Biking time once = 1 hour (one way)
Total biking time a week = 1 hour/station * 2 stations = 2 hours

Now, we add the total walking and biking times together to get the total commuting time in a week.

Total commuting time a week = Total walking time + Total biking time
Total commuting time a week = 6 hours (walking) + 2 hours (biking) = 8 hours

Therefore, the total time Roque takes to get to and from work a week with walking and biking is 8 hours.

To determine the total time Roque takes to get to and from work in a week with both walking and biking, we will calculate the time for each activity separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time Roque spends walking in a week:
- Roque walks to and from work three times a week.
- It takes him two hours to walk to work.
- It takes him two hours to walk back home.
Therefore, the total time spent walking each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ trips} \times 2 \text{ hours per trip} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time Roque spends biking in a week:
- Roque rides his bike to and from work twice a week.
- It takes him one hour to ride his bike to work.
- It takes him one hour to ride his bike back home.
Therefore, the total time spent biking each week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips} \times 1 \text{ hour per trip} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find the total time spent walking and biking in a week, we add the two totals together:
\[ 6 \text{ hours (walking)} + 2 \text{ hours (biking)} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Roque takes to get to and from work in a week with walking and biking is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]

To calculate the total time Roque spends commuting by walking and biking in a week, we need to add the time spent each day.

- Walking: 
  - To work: 2 hours per day × 3 times a week = 6 hours per week
  - From work: 2 hours per day × 3 times a week = 6 hours per week
- Biking: 
  - To work: 1 hour per day × 2 times a week = 2 hours per week
  - From work: 1 hour per day × 2 times a week = 2 hours per week

Now, we simply add the walking and biking hours together to find the total commuting time:

Total commuting time = 6 hours (walking to work) + 6 hours (walking from work) + 2 hours (biking to work) + 2 hours (biking from work)

Total commuting time = 16 hours per week

Therefore, the answer is 16 hours.

To calculate the total time Roque spends getting to and from work a week, we first need to know the time he spends walking and biking daily and then double that time since he does this routine three times a week.

1. Walking to work: 2 hours per direction, 3 times per week = 2 x 3 = 6 hours
2. Walking back to work: He does this same time, 6 hours.

3. Riding his bike to work: 1 hour per direction, 2 times per week = 1 x 2 = 2 hours
4. Riding his bike back to work: He does this same time, 2 hours.

Now we add the time spent walking to and from work and the time spent biking to and from work:

6 (walking time) + 2 (biking time) = 8 hours.

Since this routine repeats three times a week, we multiply the total time of walking and biking by 3:

8 hours x 3 = 24 hours.

Therefore, the total time Roque spends getting to and from work a week with both walking and biking is 24 hours.
