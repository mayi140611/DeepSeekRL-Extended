<reasoning>
To determine how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them receives.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Anna gets:
Anna gets 14 pieces of candy per house, and there are 60 houses in the first subdivision.
\[ 14 \text{ pieces/house} \times 60 \text{ houses} = 840 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Billy gets:
Billy gets 11 pieces of candy per house, and there are 75 houses in the second subdivision.
\[ 11 \text{ pieces/house} \times 75 \text{ houses} = 825 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, to find out how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy, we subtract Billy's total from Anna's total:
\[ 840 \text{ pieces} - 825 \text{ pieces} = 15 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Anna gets 15 more pieces of candy than Billy.

To find out how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy, we need to calculate the total number of candies each of them collects and then subtract Billy's total from Anna's total.

1. First, calculate Anna's total candies:
   - Anna goes to 60 houses.
   - She gets 14 pieces of candy per house.
   - Therefore, Anna collects \( 60 \times 14 \) candies.

2. Next, calculate Billy's total candies:
   - Billy goes to 75 houses.
   - He gets 11 pieces of candy per house.
   - Therefore, Billy collects \( 75 \times 11 \) candies.

Now, let's do the calculations:

1. Anna's total candies:
   - \( 60 \times 14 = 840 \) candies

2. Billy's total candies:
   - \( 75 \times 11 = 825 \) candies

Finally, subtract Billy's total from Anna's total to find the difference:
   - \( 840 - 825 = 15 \) candies

So, Anna gets 15 more pieces of candy than Billy.

To determine how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to her brother Billy, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them collects.

For Anna:
- She gets 14 pieces of candy per house.
- The first subdivision, which Anna visited, has 60 houses.
- Therefore, the total number of pieces of candy Anna collected is \( 14 \times 60 = 840 \) pieces.

For Billy:
- He gets 11 pieces of candy per house.
- The second subdivision, where Billy visited, has 75 houses.
- Therefore, the total number of pieces of candy Billy collected is \( 11 \times 75 = 825 \) pieces.

Now, to find out how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy, we subtract the total number of pieces collected by Billy from the total number of pieces collected by Anna:

So, the difference is \( 840 - 825 = 15 \) pieces.

Therefore, Anna gets 15 more pieces of candy than Billy.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of candy Anna collects:
Anna gets 14 pieces of candy per house, and there are 60 houses in the subdivision.
\[
14 \times 60 = 840
\]
So, Anna collects 840 pieces of candy.

Next, calculate the total number of pieces of candy Billy collects:
Billy gets 11 pieces of candy per house, and there are 75 houses in the neighboring subdivision.
\[
11 \times 75 = 825
\]
So, Billy collects 825 pieces of candy.

Now, find the difference between the number of pieces of candy Anna and Billy collect:
\[
840 - 825 = 15
\]
Therefore, Anna gets \boxed{15} more pieces of candy than Billy.

To determine how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy, we first calculate the total number of pieces of candy each of them gets.

For Anna, who goes trick-or-treating in the first subdivision with 60 houses, she gets 14 pieces of candy per house:
\[ 
 \text{Total candy for Anna} = 14 \text{ candies/house} \times 60 \text{ houses} 
\]
\[ 
 \text{Total candy for Anna} = 840 \text{ candies} 
 \]

For Billy, who goes trick-or-treating in the second subdivision with 75 houses, he gets 11 pieces of candy per house:
\[ 
 \text{Total candy for Billy} = 11 \text{ candies/house} \times 75 \text{ houses} 
 \]
\[ 
 \text{Total candy for Billy} = 825 \text{ candies} 
 \]

Next, we find the difference in the total number of pieces of candy Anna and Billy get:
\[ 
 \text{Difference in candy} = \text{Total candy for Anna} - \text{Total candy for Billy} 
 \]
\[ 
 \text{Difference in candy} = 840 \text{ candies} - 825 \text{ candies}

\[ 
 \text{Difference in candy} = 15 \text{ candies}

To determine how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy each of them collects and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of candy Anna gets. Since Anna goes to 60 houses and each house gives her 14 pieces of candy, we multiply the number of houses by the number of pieces per house:

\[ 60 \times 14 = 840 \]

So, Anna gets 840 pieces of candy.

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of candy Billy gets. Billy goes to 75 houses and each house gives him 11 pieces of candy, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of pieces per house:

\[ 75 \times 11 = 825 \]

So, Billy gets 825 pieces of candy.

To find out how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy, we subtract the number of pieces Billy gets from the number of pieces Anna gets:

\[ 840 - 825 = 15 \]

Therefore, Anna gets 15 more pieces of candy than Billy. 

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

To determine how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to her brother Billy, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them collects.

First, we calculate the total amount of candy Anna gets:
- Anna gets 14 pieces of candy per house.
- The first subdivision has 60 houses.

\[
\text{Total candy Anna gets} = 14 \text{ pieces/house} \times 60 \text{ houses} = 840 \text{ pieces of candy}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of candy Billy gets:
- Billy gets 11 pieces of candy per house.
- The second subdivision has 75 houses.

\[
\text{Total candy Billy gets} = 11 \text{ pieces/house} \times 75 \text{ houses} = 825 \text{ pieces of candy}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the total amounts of candy Anna and Billy get:

\[
\text{Difference in candy} = \text{Total candy Anna gets} - \text{Total candy Billy gets} = 840 \text{ pieces} - 825 \text{ pieces} = 15 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, Anna gets \boxed{15} more pieces of candy than her brother Billy.

To determine how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy each of them receives and then find the difference.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of candy Anna gets:
Anna gets 14 pieces of candy per house, and she goes trick-or-treating in a subdivision with 60 houses.
\[
\text{Total candy Anna gets} = 14 \times 60
\]
\[
\text{Total candy Anna gets} = 840
\]

Next, calculate the total number of pieces of candy Billy gets:
Billy gets 11 pieces of candy per house, and he goes trick-or-treating in a subdivision with 75 houses.
\[
\text{Total candy Billy gets} = 11 \times 75
\]
To perform the multiplication:
\[
11 \times 75 = 11 \times (70 + 5) = (11 \times 70) + (11 \times 5)
\]
\[
11 \times 70 = 770
\]
\[
11 \times 5 = 55
\]
\[
\text{Total candy Billy gets} = 770 + 55 = 825
\]

Now, find the difference in the total number of pieces of candy between Anna and Billy:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total candy Anna gets} - \text{Total candy Billy gets}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 840 - 825 = 15
\]

Therefore, Anna gets \(\boxed{15}\) more pieces of candy than Billy.
