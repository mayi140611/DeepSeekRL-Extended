###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Dale owns 4 sports cars. The red one can travel at twice the speed of the green one, but the green one can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue one.  The yellow one is broken and cannot move at all.  If the blue one can travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour, at what speed, in miles per hour, can the red car travel?

To determine the speed of the red car, we start by understanding the relationship between the speeds of the cars given in the problem.

1. The blue car travels at 80 miles per hour. This is the speed of the green car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of green car} = 80 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
   
2. The red car's speed is twice the speed of the green car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of red car} = 2 \times \text{Speed of green car} = 2 \times 80 \text{ miles per hour} = 160 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
   
Therefore, the red car can travel at a speed of 160 miles per hour.

The speed of the red car is determined by the blue carâ€™s speed. Given that the blue car travels at 80 miles per hour, the red car, which travels at twice the speed of the green one, travels at twice the speed of the blue car. So:

\[ \text{Speed of red car} = 2 \times \text{Speed of blue car} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ miles per hour} \]

To determine the speed of the red car, let's break down the information given:

1. The blue car travels at 80 mph.
2. The green car travels at 8 times the speed of the blue car.
3. Therefore, the speed of the green car is \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \) mph.
4. The red car travels at twice the speed of the green car.
5. Therefore, the speed of the red car is \( 640 \times 2 = 1280 \) mph.

So, the red car can travel at a speed of 1280 miles per hour.

The red car can travel at twice the speed of the green car. The green car can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue car, and the blue car travels at 80 miles per hour.

First, we find the speed of the green car:
\[ \text{Speed of green car} = 8 \times \text{Speed of blue car} = 8 \times 80 \text{ miles per hour} = 640 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we determine the speed of the red car, which is twice the speed of the green car:
\[ \text{Speed of red car} = 2 \times \text{Speed of green car} = 2 \times 640 \text{ miles per hour} = 1280 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the red car can travel at a speed of 1280 miles per hour.

The green car can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue car, which is 80 mph * 8 = 640 mph.

The red car can travel at twice the speed of the green car, so it can travel at 640 mph * 2 = 1280 mph.

Therefore, the red car can travel at a speed of 1280 miles per hour.

To determine the speed of the red car, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the speed of the blue car:
   - The blue car can travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour.

2. Determine the speed of the green car:
   - The green car can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue car.
   - Therefore, the speed of the green car is \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \) miles per hour.

3. Determine the speed of the red car:
   - The red car can travel at twice the speed of the green car.
   - Therefore, the speed of the red car is \( 640 \times 2 = 1280 \) miles per hour.

4. Determine the speed of the yellow car:
   - The yellow car is broken and cannot move at all.

5. Determine the speed of the red car considering the broken yellow car:
   - Since the yellow car is broken, it does not affect the speed of the red car.

The speed of the red car can be calculated by first determining the speed of the green car, which is 8 times the speed of the blue car. Given that the blue car travels at 80 mph, the green car travels at \( 8 \times 80 \) mph.

\[ \text{Speed of the green car} = 8 \times 80 \]

Next, the red car can travel at twice the speed of the green car. This means:

\[ \text{Speed of the red car} = 2 \times (\text{Speed of the green car}) \]

Let's calculate the specific speeds.

\[
\text{Speed of the green car} = 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ mph}
\]

Now, we can find the speed of the red car:

\[
\text{Speed of the red car} = 2 \times 640 = 1280 \text{ mph}
\]

So, the red car can travel at 1280 miles per hour.

Let's denote the speed of the blue car as \( B \), the speed of the green car as \( G \), and the speed of the red car as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = 80 \) mph (speed of the blue car)
2. \( G = 8 \times B \) (the green car can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue one)
3. \( R = 2 \times G \) (the red car can travel at twice the speed of the green one)

First, we find the speed of the green car:
\[ G = 8 \times B = 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we find the speed of the red car using the speed of the green car:
\[ R = 2 \times G = 2 \times 640 = 1280 \text{ mph} \]

So, the red car can travel at a speed of 1280 miles per hour.
