To determine how many pieces of mail Johann needs to deliver, we can start by calculating the total number of pieces of mail delivered by Johann's friends. Since both friends each deliver 41 pieces, we add their deliveries together:

41 pieces/friend Ã— 2 friends = 82 pieces

Now that we know Johann's friends deliver 82 pieces, we can subtract this from the total number of pieces that need to be delivered:

180 pieces - 82 pieces = 98 pieces

So, Johann needs to deliver 98 pieces of mail.

To find out how many pieces of mail Johann needs to deliver, we can follow these steps:

1. Johann's friends each deliver 41 pieces of mail.
2. Since they are two friends, together they deliver \( 41 \times 2 \) pieces of mail.
3. Add the number of pieces that Johann's friends deliver to the total number of pieces that need to be delivered.

Calculating:
\[ \text{Total pieces delivered by friends} = 41 \times 2 = 82 \]
\[ \text{Total pieces to deliver} = 180 \]
\[ \text{Pieces Johann needs to deliver} = 180 - 82 = 98 \]

Therefore, Johann needs to deliver 98 pieces of mail.

To find out how many pieces of mail Johann needs to deliver, we first need to determine the total number of pieces of mail his friends deliver.

His two friends deliver 41 pieces each, so together they deliver:

\(41 \text{ pieces} \times 2 \text{ friends} = 82 \text{ pieces}\)

Now, we subtract the number of pieces his friends deliver from the total number of pieces:

\(180 \text{ pieces - 82 \text{ pieces}} = 98 \text{ pieces}\)

So, Johann needs to deliver 98 pieces of mail.

To determine how many pieces of mail Johann needs to deliver, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of pieces of mail that need to be delivered, which is 180 pieces.
2. Determine the number of pieces of mail delivered by Johann's two friends. Each friend delivers 41 pieces of mail, so together they deliver:
   \[
   41 + 41 = 82 \text{ pieces of mail}
   \]
3. Subtract the number of pieces of mail delivered by Johann's friends from the total number of pieces of mail to find out how many pieces Johann needs to deliver:
   \[
   180 - 82 = 98
   \]

Therefore, Johann needs to deliver 98 pieces of mail.

First, we need to determine how many pieces of mail Johann's friends together delivered. Each friend delivered 41 pieces of mail, and there are two friends, so:

\[ 41 \text{ pieces/friend} \times 2 \text{ friends} = 82 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we add the number of pieces delivered by Johann's friends to the total number of pieces to be delivered:

\[ 180 \text{ pieces} + 82 \text{ pieces} = 262 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, to find out how many pieces Johann needs to deliver, subtract the total delivered by his friends from the overall total:

\[ 262 \text{ pieces} - 82 \text{ pieces} = 180 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Johann needs to deliver 180 pieces of mail.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of mail Johann needs to deliver after his friends have delivered their share.

1. First, we know that Johann's two friends each deliver 41 pieces of mail. Together, they deliver \( 41 + 41 = 82 \) pieces of mail.
2. Johann is responsible for delivering a total of 180 pieces of mail. To find out how many pieces Johann needs to deliver, we subtract the number of pieces his friends have delivered from the total amount of mail to be delivered.
  
   Therefore, Johann needs to deliver \( 180 - 82 = 98 \) pieces of mail.

Let's denote the number of pieces of mail Johann delivers as \( J \).

According to the problem, Johann's friends each deliver 41 pieces of mail, and there are two friends. Therefore, the total number of pieces of mail delivered by his friends is \( 41 \times 2 = 82 \).

The total number of pieces of mail to be delivered is 180. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J + 82 = 180 \]

To find \( J \), we subtract 82 from both sides:
\[ J = 180 - 82 \]
\[ J = 98 \]

So, Johann needs to deliver 98 pieces of mail.

To find out how many pieces of mail Johann needs to deliver, we first need to determine how many pieces of mail Johann's friends delivered together. Since each friend delivered 41 pieces of mail, we can add their amounts together:

41 (Johann's friend 1) + 41 (Johann's friend 2) = 82 pieces of mail delivered by both friends combined.

Now, to find out how many pieces Johann needs to deliver, we subtract the total number of pieces delivered by his friends from the total number of pieces of mail they need to deliver:

180 (total pieces of mail) - 82 (pieces delivered by friends) = 98 pieces of mail for Johann.

To find out how many pieces of mail Johann needs to deliver, we can start by calculating the total number of pieces of mail that Johann's two friends delivered.

Each friend delivered 41 pieces of mail, so the combined delivery for both friends is:

To find out how many pieces of mail Johann needs to deliver, we first need to determine the total number of pieces of mail delivered by his two friends.

Each of Johann's friends delivers 41 pieces of mail. Since there are two friends, the total number of pieces delivered by his friends would be:

\( 41 pieces/friend \times 2 friends = 82 pieces \)

Now, we subtract the total number of pieces delivered by his friends from the total number of pieces he needs to deliver:

\( 180 pieces (total) - 82 pieces (friends) = 98 pieces \)

So, Johann needs to deliver 98 pieces of mail.
