If Clover goes for a 1.5-mile walk in the morning and another 1.5-mile walk in the evening, every day, how many miles does he walk in 30 days?

#### ANS ####

90
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
<reasoning>
To calculate the total miles Clover walks in 30 days, we first determine the total miles he walks in one day. Since he walks 1.5 miles in the morning and 1.5 miles in the evening, the total miles per day is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ miles (morning)} + 1.5 \text{ miles (evening)} = 3 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles over 30 days by multiplying the daily miles by the number of days:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Clover walks 90 miles in 30 days.

To determine how many miles Clover walks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks in one day. Clover walks 1.5 miles in the morning and 1.5 miles in the evening, so the total distance he walks in one day is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ miles} + 1.5 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days to find the total distance for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Clover walks 90 miles in 30 days.

First, we need to calculate the total distance Clover walks in one day by adding the distance he walks in the morning and the evening. So, 1.5 miles + 1.5 miles = 3 miles per day. To find out how many miles he walks in 30 days, we multiply the daily total by 30. Thus, 3 miles/day * 30 days = 90 miles.

Therefore, Clover walks 90 miles in 30 days.

Clover walks 1.5 miles in the morning and another 1.5 miles in the evening every day. Therefore, he walks a total of 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 miles per day.

If Clover walks this distance every day for 30 days, then the total distance he walks in 30 days is 3 miles/day * 30 days = 90 miles.

Thus, Clover walks 90 miles in 30 days.

To calculate the total number of miles Clover walks in 30 days, we first need to determine the number of miles he walks in one day. Clover walks 1.5 miles in the morning and 1.5 miles in the evening, so in one day he walks a total of \(1.5 + 1.5 = 3\) miles.

Since he walks this distance every day for 30 days, we multiply the daily miles by 30: \(3 \times 30 = 90\) miles.

Therefore, over the course of 30 days, Clover walks a total of 90 miles.

To determine the total miles Clover walks in 30 days, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply by the number of days.

First, let's find the total distance Clover walks in one day:
- Clover walks 1.5 miles in the morning.
- Clover walks 1.5 miles in the evening.
- Therefore, the total distance walked in one day is \( 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 \) miles.

Next, we calculate the total distance walked in 30 days:
- Since Clover walks 3 miles each day, the total distance in 30 days is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) miles.

Thus, Clover walks a total of 90 miles in 30 days.

To determine the total mileage Clover walks in 30 days, we first calculate the daily mileage. Clover walks 1.5 miles in the morning and 1.5 miles in the evening, for a total of 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 miles per day. 

Next, we multiply the daily mileage by the number of days in the given period (30 days):
3 miles/day Ã— 30 days = 90 miles

So, Clover walks a total of 90 miles in 30 days.
