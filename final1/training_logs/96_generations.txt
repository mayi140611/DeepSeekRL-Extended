#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####


system
First, we calculate the total amount of water collected by James. On Monday, it rained 4 inches, and on Tuesday, it rained 3 inches. For each inch of rain, he collects 15 gallons. Therefore, the total collection for each day is:

\[
\text{Total gallons collected on Monday} = 4 \text{ inches} \times 15 \text{ gallons/inch} = 60 \text{ gallons}
\]

\[
\text{Total gallons collected on Tuesday} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 15 \text{ gallons/inch} = 45 \text{ gallons}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of water collected over the two days:

\[
\text{Total water collected} = 60 \text{ gallons} + 45 \text{ gallons} = 105 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling all this water. He can sell it for $1.2 per gallon:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 105 \text{ gallons} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 126 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money James made from selling all the water is:

\[
\boxed{126}
\]
