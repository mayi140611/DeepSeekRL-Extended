system
To determine how many nights 5 boxes of crackers will last Chad, we first need to calculate the total number of crackers in one box and then the total number of crackers in 5 boxes.

1. **Crackers per box**:
   - Each box has 4 sleeves.
   - Each sleeve holds 28 crackers.
   - Therefore, the number of crackers per box is: 
     \[
     4 \text{ sleeves} \times 28 \text{ crackers/sleeve} = 112 \text{ crackers}
     \]

2. **Total crackers in 5 boxes**:
   - Since each box contains 112 crackers, the total number of crackers in 5 boxes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ boxes} \times 112 \text{ crackers/box} = 560 \text{ crackers}
     \]

3. **Crackers per night**:
   - Chad eats 2 crackers per night.
   - The total number of crackers Chad will consume in x nights is:
     \[
     2 \text{ crackers/night} \times x \text{ nights} = 2x \text{ crackers}
     \]

4. **To find the total number of nights 5 boxes last**:
   - We set up the equation to find x when 560 crackers are consumed:
     \[
     2x = 560
     \]
   - Solving for x:
     \[
     x = \frac{560}{2} = 280
     \]

Therefore, 5 boxes of crackers will last Chad 280 nights.

To determine how many nights 5 boxes of crackers will last Chad, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of crackers per box:**
   - Each box contains 4 sleeves.
   - Each sleeve contains 28 crackers.
   - Therefore, the total number of crackers per box is \( 4 \times 28 = 112 \) crackers.

2. **Calculate the total number of crackers Chad uses per night:**
   - Chad uses 2 crackers per sandwich.
   - He has 5 sandwiches a night.
   - Therefore, the total number of crackers he uses per night is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) crackers.

3. **Calculate the number of nights 5 boxes of crackers will last:**
   - Chad has 5 boxes of crackers.
   - Each box contains 112 crackers.
   - The total number of crackers in 5 boxes is \( 5 \times 112 = 560 \) crackers.
   - Since Chad uses 10 crackers per night, the number of nights 560 crackers will last him is \( \frac{560}{10} = 56 \) nights.

To determine how many nights 5 boxes of crackers will last Chad, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of crackers in one box:**
   - Each box has 4 sleeves.
   - Each sleeve has 28 crackers.
   - Therefore, the total number of crackers in one box is \( 4 \times 28 = 112 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of crackers in 5 boxes:**
   - Since each box has 112 crackers, 5 boxes will have \( 5 \times 112 = 560 \) crackers.

3. **Determine how many crackers Chad consumes per night:**
   - Chad eats 2 crackers with each peanut butter sandwich.
   - He has 5 sandwiches per night.

4. **Calculate the number of nights 560 crackers will last:**
   - If Chad eats 2 crackers per night, the number of nights the 560 crackers will last is \( \frac{560}{2} = 280 \) nights.

**Reasoning**: The total number of crackers in 5 boxes is 560. Since Chad eats 2 crackers per night, the crackers will last him \( \frac{560}{2} = 280 \) nights.

\[ 4 \text{ sleeves} \times 28 \text{ crackers/sleeve} = 112 \text{ crackers} \]

Next, Chad consumes 2 crackers per sandwich. Given that he eats 5 sandwiches a night, the number of crackers he consumes each night is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches/night} \times 2 \text{ crackers/sandwich} = 10 \text{ crackers/night} \]

Now, we calculate how many crackers Chad consumes in one night from one box:
\[ 10 \text{ crackers/night} \times 112 \text{ crackers/box} = 1120 \text{ crackers/box} \]

Chad has 5 boxes of crackers. To find out how many nights these crackers will last, we divide the total number of crackers by the number of crackers he consumes per night from one box:
\[ \frac{5 \text{ boxes} \times 1120 \text{ crackers/box}}{10 \text{ crackers/night}} = \frac{5600 \text{ crackers}}{10 \text{ crackers/night}} = 560 \text{ nights} \]

Chad consumes 2 crackers with each peanut butter sandwich. With 560 crackers, he can make 560 / 2 = 280 sandwiches.

He has 5 sandwiches a night, so for 5 nights, the total number of sandwiches will be 5 * 280 = 1400 sandwiches.

Chad has 5 nights to make 1400 sandwiches. Therefore, these 5 boxes of crackers will last him 5 nights.

\[ 4 \text{ sleeves} \times 28 \text{ crackers/sleeve} = 112 \text{ crackers/sleeve} \]

\[ 112 \text{ crackers/sleeve} \times 4 \text{ sleeves/box} = 448 \text{ crackers/box} \]

Since Chad has 5 boxes, the total number of crackers is:

Chad eats 2 crackers with each of his 5 night crackers (\( 5 \times 2 \)) each night.

Now, divide the total number of crackers by the number of crackers he eats per box:
