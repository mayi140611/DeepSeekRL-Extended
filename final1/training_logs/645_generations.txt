###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

system
To determine the total amount the students will spend at the stationery shop, we start by calculating the cost for each student separately:

- Tolu wants 3 pencils, so the cost for Tolu is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cents.
- Robert wants 5 pencils, so the cost for Robert is \(5 \times 20 = 100\) cents.
- Melissa wants 2 pencils, so the cost for Melissa is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cents.

Next, we sum the costs for all students:
\[
60 \text{ cents} + 100 \text{ cents} + 40 \text{ cents} = 200 \text{ cents}
\]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total amount from cents to dollars:
\[
\frac{200 \text{ cents}}{100} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the students will spend \(2\) dollars altogether.

system
To find out the total amount that the students will spend altogether, we first need to calculate the cost of the pencils each person wants to buy. Since the price of one pencil is 20 cents, we multiply the number of pencils each student wants by 20 cents.

For Tolu:
Tolu wants 3 pencils, so the cost for Tolu is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cents.

For Robert:
Robert wants 5 pencils, so the cost for Robert is \(5 \times 20 = 100\) cents.

For Melissa:
Melissa wants 2 pencils, so the cost for Melissa is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cents.

Now, we add up the costs for all three students:
Total cost = Cost for Tolu + Cost for Robert + Cost for Melissa
Total cost = 60 cents + 100 cents + 40 cents = 200 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost into dollars:
Total cost in dollars = Total cost in cents / 100
Total cost in dollars = 200 cents / 100 = 2 dollars.

Therefore, the students will spend altogether 2 dollars at the stationery shop.

To find out how much the students will spend altogether, we need to calculate the total number of pencils they want to buy and then multiply that by the price of one pencil.

1. Tolu wants 3 pencils.
2. Robert wants 5 pencils.
3. Melissa wants 2 pencils.

First, we calculate the total number of pencils:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 \text{ pencils} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost in cents:

\[ 10 \text{ pencils} \times 20 \text{ cents per pencil} = 200 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 200 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the students will spend altogether 2 dollars at the stationery shop.

To find the total amount the students will spend, we first need to calculate the cost for each student:

- Tolu wants 3 pencils, so his cost will be \(3 \times 20\) cents.
- Robert wants 5 pencils, so his cost will be \(5 \times 20\) cents.
- Melissa wants 2 pencils, so her cost will be \(2 \times 20\) cents.

Next, we add up the costs of Tolu, Robert, and Melissa to find the total cost in cents:
\[3 \times 20 + 5 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 60 + 100 + 40 = 200 \text{ cents}\]

Now, we need to convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

To find out how much the students will spend altogether, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils they want to buy. 

- Tolu wants 3 pencils.
- Robert wants 5 pencils.
- Melissa wants 2 pencils.

Let's add these up: 

\[ 3 \text{ pencils} + 5 \text{ pencils} + 2 \text{ pencils} = 10 \text{ pencils} \]

Each pencil costs 20 cents. Therefore, the total cost in cents is:

\[ 10 \text{ pencils} \times 20 \text{ cents/pencil} = 200 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 200 cents to dollars:

\[ 200 \text{ cents} = \$2 \]

So, the students will spend \$2 altogether at the stationery shop.

To find the total amount spent by the students, we'll first calculate the total quantity of pencils they want to buy, which is the sum of Tolu's, Robert's, and Melissa's pencils.

Total pencils = Tolu's pencils + Robert's pencils + Melissa's pencils

Total pencils = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 pencils

Next, we'll find the cost of these pencils. Since each pencil costs 20 cents, the total cost will be:

Total cost = Number of pencils * Price per pencil
           = 10 * 20 cents
           = 200 cents

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 cents per dollar:

Total cost in dollars = 200 cents / 100
                     = 2 dollars

Therefore, the total amount the students will spend altogether at the stationery shop is 2 dollars.

First, let's calculate how much each student will spend individually.
- Tolu wants 3 pencils at 20 cents each, so $Tolu's spend is 3 * 20 = $6.00.
- Robert wants 5 pencils at 20 cents each, so $Robert's spend is 5 * 20 = $10.00.
- Melissa wants 2 pencils at 20 cents each, so $Melissa's spend is 2 * 20 = $4.00.

Next, let's sum up the total amount they all spend together:
- Total spend = Tolu's spend + Robert's spend + Melissa's spend = $6.00 + $10.00 + $4.00 = $20.00.

Now let's convert this total spend from cents to dollars.
- $20.00 = 20 dollars.

Therefore, the total amount the students will spend altogether at the stationery shop is $20.00.

To find out how much the students will spend altogether, we need to first determine the total number of pencils that each student wants, and then multiply this by the price of one pencil, which is 20 cents.

Tolu wants 3 pencils, Robert wants 5 pencils, and Melissa wants 2 pencils.

So, the total number of pencils is:

\( 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 \) pencils.

Since each pencil costs 20 cents, the total cost in cents is:

\( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) cents.

To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):

\( 200 \div 100 = 2 \) dollars.

Therefore, the students will spend a total of 2 dollars altogether at the stationery shop.

To calculate the total amount spent by the students, we first need to find out how many pencils are needed in total.

Tolu wants 3 pencils, Robert wants 5 pencils, and Melissa wants 2 pencils.

Total pencils needed = Tolu's pencils + Robert's pencils + Melissa's pencils
Total pencils needed = 3 + 5 + 2
Total pencils needed = 10

Each pencil costs 20 cents, so the total cost in cents is:

Total cost in cents = Total pencils needed ร Price per pencil
Total cost in cents = 10 ร 20
Total cost in cents = 200

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, to convert the total cost in cents to dollars, we divide by 100:

Total cost in dollars = Total cost in cents รท 100
Total cost in dollars = 200 รท 100
Total cost in dollars = 2

Therefore, the students will spend a total of 2 dollars altogether at the stationery shop.

2. Robert wants 5 pencils, and each pencil costs 20 cents. So, Robert will spend \(5 \times 20 = 100\) cents.
3. Melissa wants 2 pencils, and each pencil costs 20 cents. So, Melissa will spend \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cents.

Now, we need to add up the total spent by Tolu, Robert, and Melissa.
