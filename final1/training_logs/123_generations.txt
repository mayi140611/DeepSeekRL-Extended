To determine the price per can at the grocery store, we'll start by calculating the price per can at the bulk warehouse and then compare it to the price per can at the grocery store.

First, we find the price per can at the bulk warehouse:
\[
\text{Price per can at warehouse} = \frac{\text{Total price for 48 cans}}{\text{Number of cans per case}} = \frac{12.00}{48} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per can}
\]

Next, we calculate the price per can at the grocery store:
\[
\text{Price per can at grocery store} = \frac{\text{Total price for 12 cans}}{\text{Number of cans per case}} = \frac{6.00}{12} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per can}
\]

To determine how much more expensive per can at the grocery store, we subtract the price per can at the warehouse from the price per can at the grocery store:
\[
\text{Difference in price per can} = \text{Price per can at grocery store} - \text{Price per can at warehouse} = 0.50 - 0.25 = 0.25 \text{ dollars per can}
\]

Finally, we convert the difference from dollars to cents:
\[
0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 25 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, this deal at the grocery store is \(\boxed{25}\) cents more expensive per can.

The bulk warehouse offers 48 cans for $12.00, so each can costs $12.00 / 48 = $0.25.
The grocery store offers 12 cans for $6.00, so each can costs $6.00 / 12 = $0.50.

The difference in cost per can is $0.50 - $0.25 = $0.25 or 25 cents.

Therefore, the answer is 25.

To determine how much more expensive per can the sparkling water is at the grocery store compared to the warehouse, we need to compare the price per can at both places.

First, let's find out the price per can at the warehouse:
- The warehouse offers 48 cans for $12.00.
- To find the price per can, we divide the total price by the number of cans: \( \frac{12.00}{48} = 0.25 \) dollars per can.

Now, let's find out the price per can at the grocery store:
- The grocery store offers 12 cans for $6.00.
- To find the price per can, we divide the total price by the number of cans: \( \frac{6.00}{12} = 0.50 \) dollars per can.

Next, we need to determine how much more expensive per can at the grocery store compared to the warehouse in dollars:
- Subtract the price per can at the warehouse from the price per can at the grocery store: \( 0.50 - 0.25 = 0.25 \) dollars per can.

Finally, we convert this difference from dollars to cents:
- There are 100 cents in a dollar.
- So, \( 0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents} \).

Therefore, the deal at the grocery store is 25 cents more expensive per can compared to the warehouse.

To find out how much more expensive the deal is at the grocery store per can, we first need to calculate the cost per can at each location.

At the bulk warehouse, a case (which is 12 cans) costs $12.00, so the cost per can is $12.00 / 12 = $1.00.

At the local grocery store, 12 cans cost $6.00, so the cost per can is $6.00 / 12 = $0.50.

Now we calculate the difference in cost per can:
$1.00 (bulk warehouse) - $0.50 (grocery store) = $0.50.

To express this difference in cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

So per can, the deal at the grocery store is 50 cents more expensive than at the bulk warehouse.

To determine how much more expensive per can the deal at the grocery store is compared to the bulk warehouse, we need to calculate the price per can for each location and then compare them. 

First, let's calculate the price per can at the bulk warehouse:
- Cost of 48 cans for $12.00 = $12.00
- Price per can at the warehouse = $12.00 / 48 cans = 25 cents per can

Next, let's calculate the price per can at the local grocery store:
- Cost of 12 cans for $6.00 = $6.00
- Price per can at the grocery store = $6.00 / 12 cans = 50 cents per can

Now, we need to find the difference in price per can between the grocery store and the warehouse:
- Difference = Price per can at the grocery store - Price per can at the warehouse
- Difference = 50 cents - 25 cents = 25 cents

Therefore, the deal at the grocery store is 25 cents more expensive per can compared to the bulk warehouse.

To find out how much more expensive the grocery store deal is per can, we first need to calculate the cost per can at both the bulk warehouse and the grocery store.

At the bulk warehouse, 48 cans are priced at $12.00. To find the cost per can, we divide $12.00 by 48.

$12.00 รท 48 = $0.25 per can

At the grocery store, the deal is $6.00 for 12 cans. To find the cost per can, we divide $6.00 by 12.

$6.00 รท 12 = $0.50 per can

Now that we have the cost per can in the same unit, $0.25 at the bulk warehouse and $0.50 at the grocery store, we can subtract the supermarket price from the bulk warehouse price to find the difference.

$0.25 - $0.50 = -$0.25

The grocery store is actually cheaper per can, $0.25 less. Since the question asks how much more expensive it is, the answer will be the absolute value of the difference, which is $0.25.

To find out how much more expensive per can the deal is at the grocery store compared to the bulk warehouse, we need to follow these steps.

First, calculate the cost per can at the bulk warehouse:
The bulk warehouse offers 48 cans for $12.00. To find the price per can, we divide the total cost by the number of cans:
\[ \frac{12.00}{48} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per can} \]
Since the question asks for the price in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents per can} \]

Next, calculate the cost per can at the local grocery store:
The local grocery store offers 12 cans for $6.00. To find the price per can, we divide the total cost by the number of cans:
\[ \frac{6.00}{12} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per can} \]
Again, converting $0.50 to cents:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents per can} \]

Now, to find out how much more expensive the deal is per can at the grocery store compared to the bulk warehouse, we subtract the cost per can at the bulk warehouse from the cost per can at the grocery store:
\[ 50 \text{ cents} - 25 \text{ cents} = 25 \text{ cents} \]

So, the deal at the grocery store is 25 cents more expensive per can compared to the bulk warehouse.

To find out how much more expensive per can at the grocery store, we need to calculate the cost per can at both the warehouse and the grocery store.

At the warehouse:
48 cans for $12.00
Per can: $12.00 / 48 = $0.25

At the grocery store:
12 cans for $6.00
Per can: $6.00 / 12 = $0.50

Now, to find out how much more expensive per can at the grocery store, we subtract the price at the warehouse from the price at the grocery store:

$0.50 (warehouse) - $0.25 (grocery store) = $0.25

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

Therefore, the deal at the grocery store is 25 cents more expensive per can compared to the warehouse.

To determine how much more expensive per can the sparkling water is at the grocery store compared to the bulk warehouse, we'll first calculate the price per can at both locations.

The bulk warehouse price per can:
- 48 cans for $12.00
- Hence, price per can = $12.00 / 48 cans = $0.25 per can

The grocery store price for a case:
- 12 cans for $6.00
- Hence, price per can = $6.00 / 12 cans = $0.50 per can

Now, subtract the price per can at the bulk warehouse from the price per can at the grocery store to find the difference:
- $0.50 per can at the grocery store - $0.25 per can at the bulk warehouse = $0.25 per can

Finally, convert the price difference to cents (100 cents = 1 dollar):
- $0.25 per can x 100 cents/dollar = 25 cents per can

Therefore, the sparkling water is 25 cents more expensive per can at the grocery store compared to the bulk warehouse.

To determine how much more expensive per can the grocery store deal is compared to the bulk warehouse, we need to calculate the price per can at both locations.

First, we find the price per can at the bulk warehouse:
\[ \text{Price per can at the bulk warehouse} = \frac{12.00 \text{ dollars}}{48 \text{ cans}} \]

Next, we find the price per can at the local grocery store:
\[ \text{Price per can at the local grocery store} = \frac{6.00 \text{ dollars}}{12 \text{ cans}} \]

Now we calculate the price per can at each location:

At the bulk warehouse:
\[ \text{Price per can} = \frac{12.00}{48} = 0.25 \text{ dollars/can} \]

At the local grocery store:
\[ \text{Price per can} = \frac{6.00}{12} = 0.50 \text{ dollars/can} \]

To compare these prices, we need to convert the prices from dollars to cents:
\[ 0.25 \text{ dollars/can} = 0.25 \times 100 \text{ cents/can} = 25 \text{ cents/can} \]
\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars/can} = 0.50 \times 100 \text{ cents/can} = 50 \text{ cents/can} \]

Next, we find the difference between the two prices:
\[ \text{Difference} = 50 \text{ cents/can} - 25 \text{ cents/can} = 25 \text{ cents/can} \]

Therefore, the grocery store deal is cheaper by 25 cents per can.
