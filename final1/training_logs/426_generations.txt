Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Sheila will have in her piggy bank at the end of 4 years.

1. Calculate the total amount Sheila will save in 4 years at a rate of $276 per month:
\[ 276 \times 12 \times 4 = 13,248 \] (since she saves for 4 years, and 4 years is 48 months)

2. Add the money her family added to the piggy bank:
\[ 13,248 + 7,000 = 20,248 \] (after her family added $7,000)

3. Add the $3,000 she had saved initially:
\[ 20,248 + 3,000 = 23,248 \] (total amount after her initial savings)

So, at the end of 4 years, the amount of money in Sheila's piggy bank will be:

To find out how much money Sheila will have in her piggy bank at the end of 4 years, we need to calculate the total amount she has saved from her monthly contributions.

First, we calculate the total amount she saves every month over the 4 years:
\[ 276 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 12,960 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the secret amount her family added to the piggy bank:
\[ 12,960 \text{ dollars} + 7,000 \text{ dollars} = 20,960 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Sheila already had $3,000 in the piggy bank and her family added the secret amount, we need to add this to the total saved amount to find the total in the piggy bank:
\[ 3,000 \text{ dollars} + 20,960 \text{ dollars} = 23,960 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, at the end of 4 years, the total amount of money in Sheila's piggy bank will be:

To determine how much money will be in Sheila's piggy bank at the end of 4 years, we need to consider the initial savings, the additional amount her family added, and the monthly savings over that period.

1. **Initial Savings**: Sheila initially saved $3,000 in December.
2. **Additional Contribution**: Her family added $7,000 to the piggy bank.
3. **Monthly Savings**: Sheila saves $276 per month.
4. **Total Monthly Savings Over 4 Years**: She saves \(276 \times 12 = 3,312\) dollars per year, so for 4 years, she will save \(3,312 \times 4 = 13,248\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all these amounts:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Initial savings} + \text{Additional contribution} + \text{Total monthly savings} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 3,000 + 7,000 + 13,248 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 3,000 + 7,000 = 10,000 \]
\[ 10,000 + 13,248 = 23,248 \]

So, at the end of 4 years, the total amount of money in Sheila's piggy bank will be \(23,248\).

Initially, Sheila saved $3,000 in December. She added $7,000 by her family this week. Therefore, starting from the next month, her total savings would be the sum of the initial savings plus her monthly deposits.

To find out how much she will save in 4 years, first convert 4 years into months, which is 4 x 12 = 48 months. She will save $276 per month for 48 months, which is $276 x 48 = $13,248.

Summing the initial savings with her monthly deposits gives us $3,000 + $13,248 = $16,248.

Now, add the secret family addition of $7,000 to her total savings, resulting in $16,248 + $7,000 = $23,248.

To calculate the total amount of money Sheila's piggy bank will have at the end of 4 years, we need to consider her monthly savings, which will accumulate over time. We also need to add her family's contribution to the piggy bank.

1. **Monthly Savings Calculation**:
   - Sheila saves $276 per month for 4 years.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so 4 years is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) months.
   - Total monthly savings for 4 years: \(276 \times 48\).

2. **Compound Interest (Piggy Bank Growth)**:
   - The savings grow at an annual rate of 5% (assuming a constant growth rate over the 4 years).
   - Compound interest formula: \(A = P(1 + r)^n\), where \(A\) is the amount after \(n\) years, \(P\) is the principal amount (\$3,000), \(r\) is the annual interest rate (5% or 0.05), and \(n\) is the time in years (4).
   - Calculate the amount after 4 years with monthly savings: \(A_m\).

3. **Accounting for Family's Contribution**:
   - Current savings plus the family's contribution: \(A_m + 7000\).
   - We will round final amounts to the nearest cent.

Let's calculate the compound interest first for the monthly savings.

**Step 1: Calculate the total monthly savings over 4 years:**
\[ 276 \times 48 = 13168 \]

**Step 2: Apply the Compound Interest formula**:
\[ A_m = 3000 \times (1 + 0.05)^4 \]
\[ A_m = 3000 \times (1.05)^4 \]
\[ A_m = 3000 \times 1.2155 \]
\[ A_m = 3646.5 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount at the end of 4 years, including the family's contribution**:
\[ A_{total} = 3646.5 + 7000 \]
\[ A_{total} = 10646.5 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money in Sheila's piggy bank at the end of 4 years is $10,646.50.

**Conclusion**: 
After 4 years, at the end of the period, \( Sheila’s piggy bank will have a total amount of $10,646.50.

To find out how much money will be in Sheila’s piggy bank at the end of 4 years, we need to calculate the monthly savings and add the previous accumulated savings and the secret addition.

First, calculate the total savings per year:
\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \$276 \]
\[ \text{Number of Months in 4 years} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \]
\[ \text{Annual Savings} = \$276 \times 48 = \$13,248 \]

Calculate the total savings over 4 years:
\[ \text{Total Savings Over 4 Years} = \$13,248 \]

Add the $7,000 secret addition:
\[ \text{Total Savings} = \$13,248 + \$7,000 = \$20,248 \]

Finally, add this to her initial savings:
\[ \text{Total Savings in the Piggy Bank} = \$20,248 + \$3,000 = \$23,248 \]

To determine how much money will be in Sheila's piggy bank at the end of 4 years, we need to calculate the amount she will save by herself and then add the secret family contribution.

First, we calculate the total amount Sheila will save by herself over 4 years. She plans to save $276 per month. There are 12 months in a year, so in 4 years, there are:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ months} \]
The total amount Sheila saves herself over 4 years is:
\[ 276 \times 48 = 13088 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the secret family contribution of $7,000 to the amount Sheila saves by herself:
\[ 13088 + 7000 = 20088 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the initial amount Sheila had saved ($3,000) to the total amount she will save over the next 4 years:
\[ 3000 + 20088 = 23088 \text{ dollars} \]

So, at the end of 4 years, the total amount of money in Sheila's piggy bank will be:

To determine how much money will be in Sheila's piggy bank at the end of 4 years after her monthly contributions and the family's addition, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Sheila will save over the 4 years.
2. Add the amount her family added to the piggy bank.
3. Add the initial amount saved by Sheila to the total after the family's addition.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Sheila will save over the 4 years.**

Sheila saves $276 per month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 4 years, she will save:
\[ 276 \times 12 \times 4 = 13,824 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Add the amount her family added to the piggy bank.**

Her family secretly added $7,000 to the piggy bank. So, the total amount in the piggy bank after the family's addition is:
\[ 13,824 + 7,000 = 20,824 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Add the initial amount saved by Sheila.**

Sheila saved $3,000 initially. Adding this to the total from the family's addition gives:
\[ 20,824 + 3,000 = 23,824 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, at the end of 4 years, there will be \(\boxed{23824}\) dollars in Sheila's piggy bank.

To determine how much money will be in Sheila's piggy bank at the end of 4 years, we need to consider her monthly savings and the additional amount added by her family. First, let's break down the contributions.

1. **Current Savings:**
   Sheila saved $3,000 before last week. She continues to save $276 per month for 4 years.

2. **Monthly Savings for 4 Years:**
   To find the total number of months in 4 years, we multiply the number of years by 12:
   \[
   4 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ months}
   \]
   Each month, Sheila saves $276. Therefore, the total amount saved in the next 4 years is:
   \[
   276 \text{ dollars/month} \times 48 \text{ months} = 13,248 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Additional Contribution:**
   Her family added $7,000 to the piggy bank.

4. **Total Amount:**
   We now add the current savings of $3,000 to the additional contribution of $7,000 and the total savings from her monthly contributions over the next 4 years:
   \[
   3,000 \text{ dollars} + 7,000 \text{ dollars} + 13,248 \text{ dollars} = 23,248 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, at the end of 4 years, there will be $23,248 in Sheila's piggy bank.

   276 \text{ dollars/month} \times 48 \text{ months} = 13248 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Additional Savings from Family:**
   - Sheila's family added $7,000 into the piggy bank today.

4. **Total Savings Calculation:**
   - Adding the initial savings, monthly savings, and the additional family contribution:
   \[
   \$3,000 + \$13,248 + \$7,000 = \$23,248

In addition to the monthly savings, we need to include the $7,000 that Sheila's family added to the piggy bank. So, the total amount in the piggy bank will be the sum of the money already saved ($3,000), the additional amount added by Sheila's family ($7,000), and the total monthly savings over 4 years ($13,328):
