system
First, we need to determine how many green leaves are initially on the tea leaf plants. Since there are 18 green leaves on each of the 3 tea leaf plants, we multiply 18 by 3 to find the total number of green leaves:

\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these leaves turn yellow and fall off. One-third of the leaves from each plant turn yellow. So we take one-third of the total green leaves on one plant and then multiply by 3 (since there are 3 plants):

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

This means that 18 leaves from each plant turn yellow and fall off, which results in 18 leaves falling off. However, since there are 3 plants, we need to multiply this number by 3 to get the total number of leaves that fall off:

\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \]

Since 54 leaves fall off, we subtract this number from the original total number of green leaves to find the number of green leaves left on the plants:

\[ 54 - 54 = 0 \]

So, the number of green leaves left on the tea leaf plants is:

First, calculate the total number of green leaves on each plant:
\[ 18 \text{ leaves/plant} \]

With 3 plants, the total number of leaves is:
\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \text{ leaves} \]

One-third of the leaves turn yellow and fall off from each plant:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \text{ leaves/plant} \]

The number of leaves that fall off from each plant is:
\[ 6 \text{ leaves} \]

The number of green leaves left on each plant after some turned yellow and fell off is:
\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \text{ leaves} \]

Since there are 3 plants with 12 green leaves each, the total number of green leaves left on all the plants is:
\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ leaves} \]

Initially, there are \(18 \times 3 = 54\) green leaves on all the plants combined. 

One-third of these green leaves fall off each plant, so that's \(54 / 3 = 18\) leaves falling off each plant.

This means \(18 \times 3 = 54\) green leaves are left on all the plants combined.

So, the answer is 54 green leaves.

Initially, there are 18 green leaves on each of the 3 tea leaf plants. So, the total number of green leaves is \( 18 \times 3 = 54 \).

One-third of the leaves turn yellow and fall off on each plant. So, the number of leaves that turn yellow on each plant is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \).

Therefore, on each plant, there are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) green leaves left.

Since there are 3 plants, the total number of green leaves left on the tea leaf plants is \( 12 \times 3 = 36 \).

To determine the number of green leaves left on the tea leaf plants, we first calculate the total number of green leaves initially on the plants.

There are 18 green leaves on each of the 3 tea leaf plants. Therefore, the total number of green leaves is:
\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \]

One-third of these leaves turn yellow and fall off. So we calculate one-third of 54:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

This means that 18 green leaves fall off. To find the number of green leaves left, we subtract the number of fallen leaves from the total number of green leaves:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

So, there are 36 green leaves left on the tea leaf plants.

Originally, there are 18 green leaves on each of the 3 tea leaf plants, so that's a total of \(18 \times 3 = 54\) green leaves. One-third of these leaves turn yellow and fall off, which means \(54 \div 3 = 18\) leaves fall off per plant. Since this happens on each of the 3 plants, a total of \(18 \times 3 = 54\) leaves fall off. 

So, the number of green leaves left on the tea leaf plants is \(54 - 54 = 0\).

To find out how many green leaves are left, first we need to determine how many leaves turn yellow and fall off on each tea leaf plant.

Given that one-third of the leaves turn yellow:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, 6 leaves turn yellow and fall off on each of the 3 tea leaf plants. 

Now we calculate the number of leaves that turn yellow for all tea leaf plants:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Each plant loses 6 leaves, so for all 3 tea leaf plants:
\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \]

This means 54 leaves fall off in total.

Now, we subtract the total amount of leaves that fell off from the initial number of leaves:
\[ 54 + 18 = 72 \]

Initially, there were 18 leaves per plant and 3 plants, making a total of:
\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \]

So, the total number of leaves:
\[ 54 + 18 = 72 \]

Thus, the number of green leaves left is:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

The final answer is 18 green leaves.

To determine how many green leaves are left on the tea leaf plants, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of green leaves initially on all three plants.
2. Determine how many leaves turn yellow and fall off on each plant.
3. Calculate the total number of leaves that fall off.
4. Subtract the number of fallen leaves from the initial total to find the number of green leaves left.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Each plant initially has 18 green leaves. Since there are 3 plants, the total number of green leaves initially is:
   \[
   18 \times 3 = 54
   \]

2. One-third of the leaves on each plant turn yellow and fall off. So, on each plant, \(\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6\) leaves turn yellow and fall off.

3. Since there are 3 plants, the total number of leaves that fall off is:
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

4. Subtract the number of fallen leaves from the initial total to find the number of green leaves left:
   \[
   54 - 18 = 36
   \]

Therefore, the number of green leaves left on the tea leaf plants is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
