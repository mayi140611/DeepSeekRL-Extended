###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Mason opens the hood of his car and discovers that squirrels have been using his engine compartment to store nuts. If 2 busy squirrels have been stockpiling 30 nuts/day and one sleepy squirrel has been stockpiling 20 nuts/day, all for 40 days, how many nuts are in Mason's car?

First, we calculate the number of nuts stockpiled by the busy squirrels in a day:
\[ 2 \text{ squirrels} \times 30 \text{ nuts/squirrel/day} = 60 \text{ nuts/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of nuts stockpiled by the busy squirrels over 40 days:
\[ 60 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ nuts} \]

Then, we calculate the number of nuts stockpiled by the sleepy squirrel in a day:
\[ 1 \text{ squirrel} \times 20 \text{ nuts/squirrel/day} = 20 \text{ nuts/day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of nuts stockpiled by the sleepy squirrel over 40 days:
\[ 20 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ nuts} \]

Adding both totals together, the total number of nuts in the car is:
\[ 2400 \text{ nuts} + 800 \text{ nuts} = 3200 \text{ nuts} \]

The answer is 3200 nuts.

The busy squirrels have been stockpiling 30 nuts/day each for 40 days, so they have collected \(2 \times 30 \times 40 = 2400\) nuts. The sleepy squirrel has been stockpiling 20 nuts/day for 40 days, so it has collected \(20 \times 40 = 800\) nuts. Together, they have collected \(2400 + 800 = 3200\) nuts.

To calculate the total number of nuts in Mason's car, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of nuts each squirrel can store in one day, and then sum the results.

First, calculate the total number of nuts stockpiled by the two busy squirrels:
\[ 2 \text{ squirrels} \times 30 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 2 \times 30 \times 40 = 1200 \text{ nuts} \]

Next, calculate the total number of nuts stored by the sleepy squirrel:
\[ 1 \text{ sleepy squirrel} \times 20 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 1 \times 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ nuts} \]

Add the two totals together to get the overall amount of nuts stored in the car:
\[ 1200 \text{ nuts} + 800 \text{ nuts} = 2000 \text{ nuts} \]

So, the total number of nuts in Mason's car is 2000 nuts.

To determine the total number of nuts in Mason's car, we first need to calculate the daily nut storage for each squirrel and then sum these amounts over the 40-day period.

- Two busy squirrels stockpile 30 nuts each per day, so together they stockpile \(2 \times 30 = 60\) nuts per day.
- One sleepy squirrel stockspile 20 nuts per day.

The combined daily nut stockpile for all the squirrels is \(60 + 20 = 80\) nuts.

Over a period of 40 days, the total number of nuts stored is \(80 \times 40 = 3200\) nuts.

To determine the total number of nuts in Mason's car, we need to calculate the daily contribution from each squirrel and then multiply by the number of days they have been stockpiling nuts.

First, consider the busy squirrels:
- Each busy squirrel stockpiles 30 nuts/day.
- There are 2 busy squirrels, so together they contribute \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) nuts/day.

Next, consider the sleepy squirrel:
- The sleepy squirrel stockpiles 20 nuts/day.

Now, calculate the total daily contribution from both the busy and sleepy squirrels:
\[ 60 \text{ nuts/day} + 20 \text{ nuts/day} = 80 \text{ nuts/day} \]

Given that this has been happening for 40 days:
\[ 80 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 3200 \text{ nuts} \]

Therefore, the total number of nuts in Mason's car is 3200.

First, let's calculate the number of nuts stockpiled by the active squirrels:

- Two busy squirrels stockpile 30 nuts/day, so together they stockpile 2 * 30 = 60 nuts/day.

Over the course of 40 days, these busy squirrels would have stockpiled 60 nuts/day * 40 days = 2400 nuts.

Next, let's calculate the number of nuts stockpiled by the sleepy squirrel:

- One sleepy squirrel stockpiles 20 nuts/day.

Over the same 40 days, the sleepy squirrel would have stockpiled 20 nuts/day * 40 days = 800 nuts.

Now, to find the total number of nuts in Mason's car, we add the stockpiled nuts from both sets of squirrels:

- Total nuts = nuts from busy squirrels + nuts from sleepy squirrel
- Total nuts = 2400 nuts + 800 nuts
- Total nuts = 3200 nuts

So, Mason's car contains 3200 nuts.

First, let's calculate the number of nuts the two busy squirrels were storing in one day. This is 2 squirrels * 30 nuts/squirrel = 60 nuts.
Next, for 40 days, the two squirrels stored 60 nuts/day * 40 days = 2400 nuts.
Now, let's calculate the nuts stored by the sleepy squirrel on all 40 days. This is 1 squirrel * 20 nuts/squirrel = 20 nuts.
Adding this to the nuts stored by the two busy squirrels, the total number of nuts in Mason's car is 2400 nuts + 20 nuts = 2420 nuts.

To determine the total number of nuts in Mason's car, we need to calculate the daily nut collection from all the squirrels combined. 

- The two busy squirrels each collect 30 nuts/day, so together they collect \(2 \times 30 = 60\) nuts/day.
- The one sleepy squirrel collects 20 nuts/day.

Adding these together gives the combined daily nut collection: \(60 + 20 = 80\) nuts/day.

Since the squirrels have been stockpiling nuts for 40 days, the total number of nuts collected is \(80 \times 40 = 3200\) nuts.

Thus, Mason's car contains 3200 nuts.

First, we need to calculate the total number of nuts each squirrel has collected over 40 days.

Two busy squirrels stockpile 30 nuts/day. Therefore, in one day, the two busy squirrels together stockpile:
\[ 30 \text{ nuts/day} \times 2 = 60 \text{ nuts/day} \]

For 40 days, the two busy squirrels together will have collected:
\[ 60 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ nuts} \]

Now, letâ€™s calculate the nuts collected by the sleepy squirrel. The sleepy squirrel stockpiles 20 nuts/day. Over 40 days, the sleepy squirrel collects:
\[ 20 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ nuts} \]

Now, we sum the nuts collected by the two busy squirrels and the sleepy squirrel to find the total nuts in the car:
\[ 2400 \text{ nuts} + 800 \text{ nuts} = 3200 \text{ nuts} \]

Next, we sum the nuts stockpiled by the two busy squirrels and the sleepy squirrel over 40 days.

To determine the total number of nuts in Mason's car, we need to calculate the nut production for each squirrel over 40 days. 

First, let's calculate the production of the two busy squirrels:
- Each busy squirrel stocks 30 nuts per day.
- Over 40 days, each busy squirrel stocks \( 30 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ nuts} \).

Since there are two busy squirrels, their combined production over 40 days is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 \text{ nuts} = 2400 \text{ nuts} \]

Next, letâ€™s calculate the production of the sleepy squirrel:
- The sleepy squirrel stocks 20 nuts per day.
- Over 40 days, the sleepy squirrel stocks \( 20 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ nuts} \).

Adding the total nut production of the two busy squirrels and the sleepy squirrel together:
\[ 2400 \text{ nuts} + 800 \text{ nuts} = 3200 \text{ nuts} \]

To determine the total number of nuts in Mason's car, we need to calculate the daily contribution of each squirrels and then multiply by the total number of days.

First, let's calculate the daily nut supply from an active squirrel:
\[ 2 \text{ squirrels} \times 30 \text{ nuts/squirrel/day} = 60 \text{ nuts/day} \]

Next, the daily nut supply from the sleepy squirrel:
\[ 1 \text{ squirrel} \times 20 \text{ nuts/squirrel/day} = 20 \text{ nuts/day} \]

Now, we sum the daily nut contributions from both squirrels:
\[ 60 \text{ nuts/day} + 20 \text{ nuts/day} = 80 \text{ nuts/day} \]

The total number of nuts over 40 days is the daily total multiplied by the number of days:
\[ 80 \text{ nuts/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 3200 \text{ nuts} \]

So, the total number of nuts in Mason's car is \(3200\).
