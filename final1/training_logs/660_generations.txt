system
To determine how long a fish can live, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the average lifespan of a dog:**
   - Given: Dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters.
   - Hamster lifespan: 2.5 years.
   - Dog lifespan: \( 4 \times 2.5 = 10 \) years.

2. **Calculate the lifespan of a fish:**
   - Given: Well-cared fish live 2 years longer than dogs.
   - Dog lifespan: 10 years.
   - Fish lifespan: \( 10 + 2 = 12 \) years.

Therefore, a fish can live for 12 years.

Let's start by calculating how long a dog lives. Since dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters, we can calculate the dog's lifespan as follows:
\[ \text{Dog's lifespan} = 4 \times \text{Hamster's lifespan} = 4 \times 2.5 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years} \]

Next, we need to determine how long Ruth's fish can live, given that well-cared fish can live 2 years longer than dogs live:
\[ \text{Fish's lifespan} = \text{Dog's lifespan} + 2 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years} + 2 \text{ years} = 12 \text{ years} \]

So, Ruth's fish can live 12 years on average.

To determine how long a fish can live, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the average lifespan of dogs:**
   - Dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters.
   - Hamsters live an average of 2.5 years.
   - Therefore, dogs live \( 4 \times 2.5 = 10 \) years.

2. **Calculate the average lifespan of the fish:**
   - The fish lives 2 years longer than dogs.
   - Dogs live an average of 10 years.
   - Therefore, the fish lives \( 10 + 2 = 12 \) years.

So, a fish can live 12 years.

To determine how long a fish can live, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how long dogs live on average.
2. Use the information about fish and dogs to find out how long fish live.

First, we know that hamsters live on average 2.5 years. Dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters. So:

\[ \text{Average lifespan of dogs} = 4 \times \text{Average lifespan of hamsters} = 4 \times 2.5 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years} \]

Next, we know that well-cared fish can live 2 years longer than dogs. So:

\[ \text{Average lifespan of fish} = \text{Average lifespan of dogs} + 2 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years} + 2 \text{ years} = 12 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, a fish can live 12 years on average.

To determine how long a fish can live, we need to follow the steps given in the problem.

1. **Determine the average lifespan of the hamsters:**
   - Given: Hamsters live an average of 2.5 years.

2. **Calculate the average lifespan of the dogs:**
   - Dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters.
   - Therefore, the lifespan of dogs = 4 × 2.5 years = 10 years.

3. **Calculate the average lifespan of the fish:**
   - Fish can live 2 years longer than dogs.
   - Therefore, the lifespan of fish = 10 years + 2 years = 12 years.

So, a fish can live an average of 12 years.

2. Calculate the lifespan of a fish. The problem states that well-cared fish can live 2 years longer than dogs. So, we add 2 years to the lifespan of dogs:
   \[
   \text{Lifespan of fish} = \text{Lifespan of dogs} + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ years}

To find out how long Ruth's fish can live, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average lifespan of dogs.
2. Use the lifespan of dogs to determine the lifespan of fish.

Given that dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters, and hamsters live an average of 2.5 years, we calculate the lifespan of dogs as follows:
Lifespan of dogs = 4 × Lifespan of hamsters = 4 × 2.5 = 10 years.

Now, we are told that well-cared fish can live 2 years longer than dogs. Therefore, to find the lifespan of fish, we add 2 years to the lifespan of dogs:
Lifespan of fish = Lifespan of dogs + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 years.

So, a well-cared fish can live for 12 years.

Next, we find out how long a well-cared fish can live. The father tells Ruth that the fish can live 2 years longer than dogs. So, we add 2 to the average dog lifespan:

\[ \text{Fish lifespan} = 10 \text{ years} + 2 \text{ years} = 12 \text{ years} \]

\[ \text{Dog lifespan} = 4 \times \text{Hamster lifespan} = 4 \times 2.5 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years} \]

Ruth's fish can live 2 years longer than dogs do, so:
