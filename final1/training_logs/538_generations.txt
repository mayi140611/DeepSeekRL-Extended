###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A paper company decides to operate their business more sustainably. They decide that for every tree they chop down, they want to plant three more. If the company chops down 200 trees in the first half of the year and 300 more trees in the second half of the year, how many more trees does the company need to plant?

system
To determine how many trees the company needs to plant, we need to calculate the total number of trees they chop down each half of the year and then use the sustainability strategy of planting three for every tree they chop down.

First, calculate the total number of trees chopped down in the first half of the year:
\[ 200 \text{ trees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of trees chopped down in the second half of the year:
\[ 300 \text{ trees} \]

Now, find the total number of trees chopped down over the entire year:
\[ 200 \text{ trees} + 300 \text{ trees} = 500 \text{ trees} \]

According to the company's sustainability strategy, for each tree they chop down, they need to plant 3 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees they need to plant is:
\[ 500 \text{ trees} \times 3 \text{ trees/planted} = 1500 \text{ trees} \]

So, the company needs to plant 1500 more trees.

To find out how many more trees the company needs to plant, we first need to determine the total number of trees chopped down in the year. 

In the first half of the year, they chopped down 200 trees.
In the second half of the year, they chopped down 300 trees.

So, the total number of trees chopped down in the year is:
200 + 300 = 500 trees.

According to their decision, for every tree they chop down, they want to plant three more.

Therefore, the total number of trees they need to plant is:
500 trees (chopped down) Ã— 3 trees/planted = 1500 trees.

So, the company needs to plant 1500 trees more.

To determine how many more trees the company needs to plant, we need to calculate the total number of trees they chop down and then multiply by three (since they want to plant three trees for every tree chopped down).

First, we calculate the total number of trees chopped down:
\[
200 \text{ trees (first half)} + 300 \text{ trees (second half)} = 500 \text{ trees}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of trees to be planted:
\[
500 \text{ trees} \times 3 = 1500 \text{ trees}
\]

Therefore, the company needs to plant 1500 trees.

The company chopped down 200 trees in the first half of the year and 300 in the second half of the year, for a total of \(200 + 300 = 500\) trees. 

For every one tree chopped down, they plant three more trees. Since they chopped down 500 trees, they need to plant \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) more trees.

To determine how many more trees the company needs to plant, we first need to calculate the total number of trees chopped down in the year.

The company chops down 200 trees in the first half and 300 trees in the second half of the year. So the total number of trees chopped down is:

\[ 200 + 300 = 500 \]

For every tree chopped down, the company plants three more. Therefore, if 500 trees are chopped down, the number of trees to be planted is:

\[ 500 \times 3 = 1500 \]

So, the company needs to plant 1500 more trees.

To determine how many more trees the company needs to plant, we need to calculate the total number of trees they chop down in the year and then double that number since they are planting three for every one they cut down.

First, add the number of trees chopped down in the first half of the year to the number chopped down in the second half:
\[ 200 + 300 = 500 \]

Since they plant three trees for every one they chop down, we need to multiply this total by three:
\[ 500 \times 3 = 1500 \]

Therefore, the company needs to plant 1500 more trees.

In the first half of the year, the company chops down 200 trees and wants to plant 3 more for every tree cut down. So, the number of trees they need to plant is \(200 \times 3 = 600\).

In the second half of the year, they chop down 300 more trees. So, the number of trees they need to plant for these is \(300 \times 3 = 900\).

The total number of trees they need to plant is the sum of the trees planted in both halves of the year, which is \(600 + 900 = 1500\).

To determine how many more trees the company needs to plant, we start by calculating the total number of trees chopped down in the entire year.

First, we find the total number of trees chopped down in each half of the year:
- Trees chopped down in the first half: 200
- Trees chopped down in the second half: 300

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of trees chopped down in the year:
\[
200 + 300 = 500
\]

The company plans to plant three trees for every tree they chop down. Therefore, we need to calculate the total number of trees needed to be planted:
\[
3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Thus, the company needs to plant 1500 more trees to meet their sustainability goals.

To determine how many trees the company needs to plant, we first need to calculate the total number of trees they chop down over the year.

First, we add the number of trees chopped down in the first half of the year to the number in the second half of the year:
\[ 200 + 300 = 500 \]

Next, we need to determine how many trees they would plant for every tree they chop down. The company plants three trees for every tree chopped down. Therefore, the total number of trees they need to plant is:
\[ 500 \times 3 = 1500 \]

So, the company needs to plant 1500 more trees.

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of trees chopped down and then determine how many trees the company wants to plant.

For the first half of the year, they chopped down 200 trees. For the second half of the year, they chopped down an additional 300 trees. In total, they chopped down \(200 + 300 = 500\) trees.

According to their plan, for every tree chopped down, they want to plant three more. So, if they chopped down 500 trees, they should plant \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) trees to maintain their sustainability plan.

Now, we need to find out how many more trees they need to plant. Since they should have planted 1500 trees but have only chopped down 500, the company needs to plant \(1500 - 0\) (though technically this number is zero because they are at the target) more trees.

However, the correct interpretation is that they have planted 1500 trees, so they need to plant 0 more trees to meet the plan.

The paper company wants to plant 3 trees for every tree they chop down.

In the first half of the year, they chop down 200 trees, so they need to plant:
200 trees * 3 trees/planted = 600 trees

In the second half of the year, they chop down 300 more trees, plus 600 from the first half, for a total of:
200 trees + 300 trees = 500 trees chopped down

Therefore, they need to plant:
500 trees * 3 trees/planted = 1500 trees

Now, taking into account the chopping down of 500 trees, the number of trees they need to plant is:
1500 trees - 500 trees = 1000 trees

Thus, the company needs to plant 1000 more trees.
