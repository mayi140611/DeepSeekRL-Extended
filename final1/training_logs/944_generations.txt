Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Yola currently weighs 220 pounds.
2. Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently, so Wanda's current weight is:
   \( 220 + 30 = 250 \) pounds.
3. Wanda also weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago. Let's denote Yola's weight 2 years ago as \( Y \). According to the information, Wanda's current weight is 250 pounds, which is 80 pounds more than Yola's weight 2 years ago. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \( Y + 80 = 250 \).
4. Solving for \( Y \):
   \( Y = 250 - 80 = 170 \) pounds.
5. So, Yola weighed 170 pounds 2 years ago.

Let's denote Yola's weight 2 years ago as \( y \).

From the problem statement, we know:
1. Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently.
2. Wanda weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago.

Since Yola's current weight is 220 pounds, we can derive the weight Wanda currently has:
Wanda's weight \( = y + 30 \) pounds.

Also:
\( Wanda's weight = 220 + 80 = 300 \) pounds.

We can now set up the equation:
\[ y + 30 = 300 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 300 - 30 = 270 \]

So, 2 years ago, Yola weighed 270 pounds.

We know that Wanda currently weighs 220 pounds and is 30 pounds more than Yola. Therefore, we can calculate Yola's current weight as:

\[ \text{Yola's current weight} = \text{Wanda's current weight} - 30 \]

\[ \text{Yola's current weight} = 220 - 30 = 190 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Wanda weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago. So, we can calculate Yola's weight 2 years ago as:

\[ \text{Yola weight 2 years ago} = \text{Wanda's current weight} - 80 \]

\[ \text{Yola weight 2 years ago} = 220 - 80 = 140 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Yola weighed 140 pounds 2 years ago.

Let's denote Yola's current weight as \( Y_c \) and Wanda's current weight as \( W_c \). According to the problem, Wanda's current weight is 30 pounds more than Yola's current weight, and Wanda's current weight is also 80 pounds more than Yola's weight two years ago. We are given that Yola currently weighs 220 pounds, so we can set up the following equations:

1. \( W_c = Y_c + 30 \)
2. \( W_c = Y_c - 80 \)

From these two equations, we can set them equal to each other since they both equal \( W_c \):

\[ Y_c + 30 = Y_c - 80 \]

However, there is a mistake in the interpretation. Instead of having the same equation for both \( W_c \), we should use the correct subtraction for the second equation after finding Yola's weight 2 years ago. 

From equation 1 or \( W_c = Y_c + 30 \) and \( W_c = Y_c - 80 \) is incorrect, we should use \( W_c = Y_c - 80 \) based on the second part of the question.

Now, we know Yola's current weight \( Y_c = 220 \) pounds. We can determine \( Y_c - 80 \) by substituting \( Y_c \) in the second equation:

\[ W_c = 220 - 80 = 140 \]

Therefore, Wanda's current weight is 140 pounds.

To find out how much Yola weighed 2 years ago, we need to subtract 80 pounds from her current weight (since Wanda is 80 pounds heavier than Yola two years ago):

\[ \text{Yola's weight two years ago} = 220 - 80 = 140 \]

Thus, Yola weighed 140 pounds two years ago.

Let's denote Yola's weight 2 years ago as \(Y_2\). According to the problem, Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently, and 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago. We know Yola's current weight is 220 pounds. 

So we can set up the equations:
1. \(Wanda = Yola \text{ current weight} + 30 = 220 + 30 = 250\) pounds.
2. \(Wanda = Yola \text{ weight 2 years ago} + 80 = Y_2 + 80\).

From these two equations, we can set them equal to each other:
\[250 = Y_2 + 80\]
By solving for \(Y_2\), we get:
\[Y_2 = 250 - 80 = 170\]

So Yola weighed 170 pounds 2 years ago.

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the current weight of Yola.

First, let's denote Yola's weight 2 years ago as \( Y_{\text{2 years ago}} \).

According to the problem, Yola's current weight is 80 pounds more than what she weighed 2 years ago. Therefore, we can express Yola's current weight as:
\[ \text{Yola's current weight} = Y_{\text{2 years ago}} + 80 \]
Given that Yola's current weight is 220 pounds:
\[ 220 = Y_{\text{2 years ago}} + 80 \]

To find \( Y_{\text{2 years ago}} \), we subtract 80 from 220:
\[ Y_{\text{2 years ago}} = 220 - 80 \]
\[ Y_{\text{2 years ago}} = 140 \]

Since Yola currently weighs 30 pounds more than Wanda:
\[ \text{Wanda's current weight} = Y_{\text{2 years ago}} + 30 \]
\[ \text{Wanda's current weight} = 140 + 30 \]
\[ \text{Wanda's current weight} = 170 \]

However, this calculation suggests a contradiction because we need to ensure \( 170 \) pounds doesn't contradict the given information.

Now we determine \( Y_{\text{2 years ago}} \) by comparing the problem's condition directly with the formula and actual given data: Yola's current weight being 80 pounds more than what she weighed 2 years ago.

Revisiting the direct comparison:
\[ \text{Yola's current weight} = 220 \]

We've already established \( Y_{\text{2 years ago}} = 140 \), but the main goal is to find how much Yola weighed 2 years ago without discrepancies.

Now the correct formula calculation remains:
\[ \text{Yola's current weight} = 220 \]
\[ 220 = Y_{\text{2 years ago}} + 80 \]
\[ Y_{\text{2 years ago}} = 220 - 80 \]
\[ Y_{\text{2 years ago}} = 140 \]

We've reconciled using:
\[ Y_{\text{2 years ago}} = 140 \]

So, the weight that fits with the given setup is:
**Yola weighed 140 pounds 2 years ago.**

We can set up a system of equations to represent the given information:

1. Wanda's current weight = Yola's current weight + 30 pounds
2. Wanda's current weight = Yola's weight from two years ago + 80 pounds

Let \( W \) represent Yola's current weight, and \( Y_2 \) represent Yola's weight two years ago. From the first point, we have:
\[ W = Y_2 + 30 \]

From the second point, we know that Wanda's current weight is 80 pounds more than Yola's weight 2 years ago:
\[ W = Y_2 + 80 \]

Since we are given that Yola's current weight \( W \) is 220 pounds, we can substitute 220 for \( W \):
\[ 220 = Y_2 + 80 \]

To find \( Y_2 \), we solve for \( Y_2 \) by subtracting 80 from both sides of the equation:
\[ Y_2 = 220 - 80 \]
\[ Y_2 = 140 \]

Therefore, Yola weighed 140 pounds two years ago.

Let's denote Yola's current weight as \( Y_c \) and her weight 2 years ago as \( Y_{2\text{y}} \).

According to the information given:
1. Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola. So, \( W = Y_c + 30 \).

2. Wanda weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago. So, \( W = Y_{2\text{y}} + 80 \).

We are given that Yola's current weight is 220 pounds, so \( Y_c = 220 \).

Using this information, we can substitute \( Y_c \) in the first equation:
\[ W = 220 + 30 = 250 \]

We also know from the second statement that Wanda's current weight is 80 pounds more than Yola's weight 2 years ago:
\[ W = Y_{2\text{y}} + 80 \]
\[ 250 = Y_{2\text{y}} + 80 \]

Now we can solve for \( Y_{2\text{y}} \):
\[ Y_{2\text{y}} = 250 - 80 = 170 \]

So, Yola weighed 170 pounds 2 years ago.

Let's denote the current weight of Yola as \( Y \). According to the information given:

1. \( W = Y + 30 \) (Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently)
2. \( W = Y - 2 + 80 \) (Wanda weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago)

Since the second equation simplifies to \( W = Y + 78 \).

We are told that Yola currently weighs 220 pounds, so \( Y = 220 \).

Plugging \( Y \) into the first equation:

\( W = 220 + 30 \)

\( W = 250 \)

For the second equation:

\( W = 220 + 78 \)

\( W = 298 \)

It seems that there's a contradiction since Wanda's current weight (\( W \)) is supposed to be the same in both initial statements but it varies based on the context. However, if we analyze the problem carefully, it seems there's an inconsistency based on the straightforward interpretation provided.

To clarify, if Yola currently weighs 220 pounds, and it's explicitly stated that Wanda weighs 30 pounds more, let's re-evaluate:

\( W = Y + 30 \)

\( W = 220 + 30 \)

\( W = 250 \)

Since \( W = 250 \), and based on the second statement:

\( W = Y - 2 + 80 \)

\( 250 = Y - 2 + 80 \)

\( 250 = Y + 78 \)

\( Y = 172 \)

So based on the second statement, Yola weighed 172 pounds 2 years ago.

If Yola currently weighs 220 pounds, then Wanda weighs 250 pounds. Subtracting 2 pounds gives the weight of Wanda 2 years ago. But this doesn't align with the initial statements, so considering the contradiction, it's essential to reassess the information provided.

Given the problem's context, if Yola weighed 172 pounds 2 years ago (using the second statement interpretation), then Wanda's current weight of 250 pounds would be inconsistent.

Therefore, the straightforward calculation based on the first statement and the assumption that Yola's current weight aligns with Wanda's current weight minus 30 pounds does not provide a coherent solution with the given conditions.

If the intention is to find Yola's weight 2 years ago using the straightforward calculation from the first statement:

\( Y - 2 = 220 - 2 = 218 \)

Thus, Yola weighed 218 pounds 2 years ago based on the first statement.

However, recognizing the inconsistency, if we follow the second statement to find Wanda's weight 2 years ago:

\( W - 2 = W - 2 = 220 - 2 = 218 \)

218 pounds.

So, based on the interpretation of the second statement, Yola weighed 218 pounds 2 years ago, and Wanda weighed 216 pounds 2 years ago based on the second statement.

Given the initial instructions and the two interpretations of the statements, we cannot conclusively determine a consistent answer without further clarification.

Let's denote Yola's weight 2 years ago as \( y \). According to the problem:

Let's denote Yola's current weight as \( Y_c \) and Wanda's current weight as \( W_c \).

From the problem, we have:
1. \( W_c = Y_c + 30 \) (Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently)
2. \( W_c = Y_c - 80 \) (Wanda weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago)

Given \( Y_c = 220 \) pounds, we can substitute this into the equations to find \( W_c \).

From the first equation: \( W_c = 220 + 30 = 250 \) pounds.
From the second equation: \( W_c = 220 - 80 = 140 \) pounds.

Since \( W_c \) must be the same according to both equations, we have a contradiction unless we recognize that there's a common reference point for Wanda's weight change over time. Therefore, let's reframe the system with the consistent reference points.

Let's denote Yola's weight 2 years ago as \( Y_{2y} \). According to the problem, Wanda's current weight is 80 pounds more than Yola's weight 2 years ago:
1. \( W_c = Y_{2y} + 80 \).
2. Since we have \( W_c = 250 \), we substitute this into the equation: \( 250 = Y_{2y} + 80 \).
