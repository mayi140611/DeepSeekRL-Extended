#### ANS ####

125
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the amount of money Williams has as \( W \).

Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, so Jackson's amount \( J \) can be expressed as:
\[ J = 5W \]

Together, they have $150, so we can write:
\[ J + W = 150 \]

Substituting \( J \) with \( 5W \) in the second equation, we get:
\[ 5W + W = 150 \]
\[ 6W = 150 \]

Now, we can solve for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{150}{6} \]
\[ W = 25 \]

Since \( J = 5W \), Jackson has:
\[ J = 5 \times 25 \]
\[ J = 125 \]

So, Jackson has $125.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the amount of money Williams has as \( W \). Since Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, Jackson has \( 5W \) dollars.

Together, they have \( 5W + W = 50W \) dollars. According to the problem, they have $150 together. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 50W = 150 \]

To find \( W \), we solve for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{150}{50} = 3 \]

Now, we know that Jackson has \( 5W \). Substituting \( W = 3 \) into the equation gives us:
\[ 5W = 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

So, Jackson has $15 in dollars.

Let's denote the amount of money Williams has as \( W \).

Since Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, Jackson's amount of money would be \( 5W \).

Together, they have $150, which gives us the equation:
\[ W + 5W = 150 \]
\[ 6W = 150 \]
\[ W = 25 \]

Williams has $25, so Jackson has:
\[ 5W = 5 \times 25 = 125 \] dollars.

Therefore, Jackson has 125 dollars.

system
Let's denote the amount of money Williams has as \( W \). According to the problem, Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, so Jackson has \( 5W \) dollars.

The total amount of money they have together is $150. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
W + 5W = 150
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
6W = 150
\]

To find \( W \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[
W = \frac{150}{6} = 25
\]

So, Williams has $25. Since Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, Jackson has:

\[
5W = 5 \times 25 = 125
\]

Therefore, Jackson has $125.

Let's denote the amount of money Williams has as \( W \) and the amount of money Jackson has as \( J \).

Given:
- Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams.
- Together, they have $150.

From the information, we can write the following equations:
\[ J = 5W \]
\[ J + W = 150 \]

Substitute \( J \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 5W + W = 150 \]
\[ 6W = 150 \]

Solve for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{150}{6} \]
\[ W = 25 \]

Now that we know Williams has $25, we can find out how much Jackson has:
\[ J = 5W \]
\[ J = 5 \times 25 \]
\[ J = 125 \]

Therefore, Jackson has $125.
