###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Reggie and his brother are having a basketball shooting contest. They each get to take 10 shots. Layups are worth 1 point, free throws are worth 2 points, and anything further away is worth 3 points. Reggie makes 3 layups, two free throws, and one long shot. His brother only shoots long shots and makes 4 of them. How many points does Reggie lose by?

system
First, let's calculate the points Reggie scored:

- Reggie makes 3 layups, which are worth 1 point each, so he scores \(3 \times 1 = 3\) points from layups.
- Reggie makes 2 free throws, which are worth 2 points each, so he scores \(2 \times 2 = 4\) points from free throws.
- Reggie makes 1 long shot, which is worth 3 points.

Adding these together:
\[3 \text{ points} + 4 \text{ points} + 3 \text{ points} = 10 \text{ points}\]

Now, let's calculate the points his brother scored:

- Reggie's brother makes 4 long shots, which are each worth 3 points, so he scores \(4 \times 3 = 12\) points.

Now, we compare the scores:

- Reggie's total points: 10 points
- Brother's total points: 12 points

Reggie loses by \(12 - 10 = 2\) points.

To determine how many points Reggie loses by, we first need to calculate the total points scored by both Reggie and his brother.

Reggie's points calculation:
- Layups: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) points
- Free throws: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) points
- Long shots: \(1 \times 3 = 3\) points
- Total points for Reggie: \(3 + 4 + 3 = 10\) points

Reggie's brother's points calculation:
- Long shots: \(4 \times 3 = 12\) points

Now, we calculate the difference in points between Reggie and his brother:
- Difference in points: \(12 - 10 = 2\) points

Therefore, Reggie loses by 2 points.

To determine how many points Reggie loses by, we need to calculate the total points for both Reggie and his brother after the contest.

First, let's calculate Reggie's total points:
- Reggie makes 3 layups, each worth 1 point: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) points.
- Reggie makes 2 free throws, each worth 2 points: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) points.
- Reggie makes 1 long shot, worth 3 points: \(1 \times 3 = 3\) points.
Adding these up, Reggie's total points is \(3 + 4 + 3 = 10\) points.

Next, let's calculate his brother's total points:
- Reggie's brother makes 4 long shots, each worth 3 points: \(4 \times 3 = 12\) points.
So, his brother's total points is 12 points.

Finally, we compare the points to find out how many points Reggie loses by:
- His brother's total points: 12 points
- Reggie's total points: 10 points
Subtracting Reggie's points from his brother's points: \(12 - 10 = 2\) points.

Therefore, Reggie loses by 2 points.

To determine how many points Reggie loses by, we first need to calculate the points scored by each player based on the given scoring system.

1. **Reggie's scoring:**
   - Layups: Each layup is worth 1 point. Reggie makes 3 layups.
     \[
     3 \text{ layups} \times 1 \text{ point per layup} = 3 \text{ points}
     \]
   - Free throws: Each free throw is worth 2 points. Reggie makes 2 free throws.
     \[
     2 \text{ free throws} \times 2 \text{ points per free throw} = 4 \text{ points}
     \]
   - Long shots: Each long shot is worth 3 points. Reggie makes 1 long shot.
     \[
     1 \text{ long shot} \times 3 \text{ points per long shot} = 3 \text{ points}
     \]
   - Total points for Reggie:
     \[
     3 \text{ points} + 4 \text{ points} + 3 \text{ points} = 10 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Reggie's brother's scoring:**
   - Long shots: Each long shot is worth 3 points. Reggie's brother makes 4 long shots.
     \[
     4 \text{ long shots} \times 3 \text{ points per long shot} = 12 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Calculating the difference in points:**
   - Reggie's total points: 10 points
   - Reggie's brother's total points: 12 points
   \[
   12 \text{ points} - 10 \text{ points} = 2 \text{ points}
   \]

**Reasoning:** Reggie and his brother are competing in a basketball shooting contest. Reggie scores 10 points and his brother scores 12 points. The difference in their points is \(12 - 10 = 2\).

**Answer:** Reggie loses by 2 points.

To calculate the points, we need to look at the scoring system:
- Layups are worth 1 point each.
- Free throws are worth 2 points each.
- Anything further away (long shots) are worth 3 points each.

Let's assign points for Reggie's shots:
- Reggie makes 3 layups: 3 layups * 1 point each = 3 points
- Reggie makes 2 free throws: 2 free throws * 2 points each = 4 points
- Reggie makes 1 long shot: 1 long shot * 3 points = 3 points

Total points for Reggie:
3 + 4 + 3 = 10 points

Now, let's calculate the points for Reggie's brother:
- His brother makes 4 long shots: 4 long shots * 3 points each = 12 points

By comparing the totals:
Reggie: 10 points
Brother: 12 points

Reggie loses by 2 points.

To determine how many points Reggie loses by, we need to calculate the total points scored by both Reggie and his brother.

First, let's calculate Reggie's points:
- Reggie makes 3 layups. Since each layup is worth 1 point, he scores \(3 \times 1 = 3\) points from layups.
- Reggie makes 2 free throws. Since each free throw is worth 2 points, he scores \(2 \times 2 = 4\) points from free throws.
- Reggie makes 1 long shot. Since each long shot is worth 3 points, he scores \(1 \times 3 = 3\) points from the long shot.
Adding these together, Reggie's total points are \(3 + 4 + 3 = 10\) points.

Next, let's calculate his brother's points:
- Reggie's brother makes long shots and scores 4 of them. Since each long shot is worth 3 points, he scores \(4 \times 3 = 12\) points from his long shots.

Now, we find the difference in their points:

- Layups: 3 shots * 1 point each = 3 points
- Free throws: 2 shots * 2 points each = 4 points
- Long shots: 1 shot * 3 points each = 3 points
