###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

At a gym, the blue weights are 2 pounds each, and the green weights are 3 pounds each. Harry put 4 blue weights and 5 green weights onto a metal bar. The bar itself weighs 2 pounds. What is the total amount of weight, in pounds, of Harry's custom creation?

system
To determine the total weight of Harry's custom creation, we need to calculate the weight of the blue weights, the green weights, and the bar itself.

First, calculate the total weight of the blue weights:
\[ 4 \text{ blue weights} \times 2 \text{ pounds/blue weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the total weight of the green weights:
\[ 5 \text{ green weights} \times 3 \text{ pounds/green weight} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the weight of the bar:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, add up all these weights to get the total weight of Harry's custom creation:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds (blue weights)} + 15 \text{ pounds (green weights)} + 2 \text{ pounds (bar)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of weight is 25 pounds.

The total weight of the blue weights is 4 blue weights * 2 pounds/weight = 8 pounds.
The total weight of the green weights is 5 green weights * 3 pounds/weight = 15 pounds.
The total weight of Harry's custom creation is 8 pounds + 15 pounds + 2 pounds = 25 pounds.

To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the blue weights, the green weights, and then add the weight of the bar itself.

1. **Weight of blue weights:**
\[ 4 \text{ blue weights} \times 2 \text{ pounds per blue weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

2. **Weight of green weights:**
\[ 5 \text{ green weights} \times 3 \text{ pounds per green weight} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

3. **Weight of the bar:**
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add all these weights together:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of weight of Harry's custom creation is 25 pounds.

To find the total weight of Harry's custom creation, we need to calculate the weight contributed by the blue weights and the green weights, and then add the weight of the metal bar.

First, calculate the weight of the blue weights:
\[ 4 \text{ blue weights} \times 2 \text{ pounds/blue weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the weight of the green weights:
\[ 5 \text{ green weights} \times 3 \text{ pounds/green weight} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, add the weight of the metal bar:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds (bar)} \]

Now, sum the weights of the blue weights, green weights, and the bar:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds (blue weights)} + 15 \text{ pounds (green weights)} + 2 \text{ pounds (bar)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of weight of Harry's custom creation is 25 pounds.

To find the total weight of Harry's custom creation, we need to calculate the weight of the blue weights, the green weights, and add them to the weight of the metal bar.

1. **Weight of blue weights**: Each blue weight is 2 pounds, and Harry put 4 of them on the bar. Therefore, the total weight of the blue weights is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds.
2. **Weight of green weights**: Each green weight is 3 pounds, and Harry put 5 of them on the bar. Therefore, the total weight of the green weights is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) pounds.
3. **Weight of the metal bar**: The metal bar weighs 2 pounds.

Now, we can add these three amounts together to find the total weight:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, add all these weights together to get the total weight of the custom creation:
\[ \text{Total weight} = (\text{Weight of blue weights}) + (\text{Weight of green weights}) + (\text{Weight of the bar}) \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of Harry's custom creation, we first calculate the weight contributed by the blue weights. Each blue weight is 2 pounds, and Harry used 4 of them. So, the total weight of the blue weights is:

\[ 4 \text{ weights} \times 2 \text{ pounds/weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight contributed by the green weights. Each green weight is 3 pounds, and Harry used 5 of them. So, the total weight of the green weights is:

\[ 5 \text{ weights} \times 3 \text{ pounds/weight} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now we add the weight of the bar, which is 2 pounds. So the total weight of Harry's custom creation is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of weight is 25 pounds.

The total weight of the blue weights is calculated by multiplying the number of blue weights by their weight: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. The total weight of the green weights is calculated by multiplying the number of green weights by their weight: 5 * 3 = 15 pounds. Adding the weight of the metal bar, the total weight of Harry's custom creation is 8 + 15 + 2 = 25 pounds.

To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the blue weights, the green weights, and the bar itself separately, then add them together.

1. **Weight of blue weights**: Each blue weight is 2 pounds, and Harry put 4 of them. So, the total weight of the blue weights is:
\[ 4 \text{ weights} \times 2 \text{ pounds/weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

2. **Weight of green weights**: Each green weight is 3 pounds, and Harry put 5 of them. So, the total weight of the green weights is:

3. **Weight of the bar**: The bar itself weighs 2 pounds.

Now, we add up all the weights:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds (blue weights)} + 15 \text{ pounds (green weights)} + 2 \text{ pounds (bar)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

First, calculate the total weight of the blue weights:
- Each blue weight is 2 pounds.
- Harry has 4 blue weights.
\[ 2 \, \text{pounds/weight} \times 4 \, \text{weights} = 8 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, calculate the total weight of the green weights:
- Each green weight is 3 pounds.
- Harry has 5 green weights.
\[ 3 \, \text{pounds/weight} \times 5 \, \text{weights} = 15 \, \text{pounds} \]

Now, add the weight of the blue and green weights together:
\[ 8 \, \text{pounds} + 15 \, \text{pounds} = 23 \, \text{pounds} \]

Finally, add the weight of the bar:
\[ 23 \, \text{pounds} + 2 \, \text{pounds} = 25 \, \text{pounds} \]
