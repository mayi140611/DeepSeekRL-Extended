The craft store made 36 sales today. One third of these sales were in the fabric section, which is \( \frac{3}{3} \times 36 = 24 \) sales. A quarter of the sales were in the jewelry section, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \) sales. The rest of the sales were in the stationery section. To find out how many sales were in the stationery section, we subtract the sales in the fabric and jewelry sections from the total number of sales: \( 36 - 24 - 9 = 3 \) sales.

The craft store makes sales in the fabric section, jewelry section, and stationery section, with fabric sales being one third of total sales, jewelry sales being one quarter of total sales, and the rest in the stationery section.

To find the number of sales in the stationery section, we start by calculating the total sales from the fabric and jewelry sections.

Sales in the fabric section: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \)
Sales in the jewelry section: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \)

Total sales from fabric and jewelry: \( 12 + 9 = 21 \)

Since the total sales are 36, the rest go to the stationery section.

Total stationery sales: \( 36 - 21 = 15 \)

So, the craft store made 15 sales in the stationery section today.

To find the number of sales in the stationery section, we first need to determine the total number of sales in the fabric and jewelry sections.

A third of the sales are in the fabric section, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \text{ sales} \]

A quarter of the sales are in the jewelry section, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \text{ sales} \]

The total sales in the fabric and jewelry sections together is:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ sales} \]

Since the total sales for the day is 36, the sales in the stationery section are:
\[ 36 - 21 = 15 \text{ sales} \]

system
The craft store makes sales in the fabric section, jewelry section, or stationery section. The total number of sales is 36, so the total fraction of sales in these sections is:

$$
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{x} = 1
$$

where \(\frac{1}{x}\) is the fraction of sales in the stationery section.

Solving for \(x\):

$$
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{x}
$$

Combining \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\):

$$
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4+3}{12} = \frac{7}{12}
$$

So:

$$
1 - \frac{7}{12} = 1 - \frac{7}{12} = \frac{5}{12}
$$

There are 36 sales in total:

$$
\frac{5}{12}x = 36
$$

Solving for \(x\):

$$
x = 36 \times \frac{12}{5} = 72 \times \frac{12}{5} = 144
$$

Therefore, the answer is 144.

First, we calculate the total sales made in the fabric section. A third of the sales were in the fabric section, which is 36 * 1/3 = 12 sales. Next, we calculate the total sales made in the jewelry section. A quarter of the sales were in the jewelry section, which is 36 * 1/4 = 9 sales. To determine the sales made in the stationery section, we subtract the sales made in the fabric and jewelry sections from the total sales. This gives us 36 - 12 - 9 = 15 sales.

To find the number of sales in the stationery section, let's start by calculating the sales in the fabric and jewelry sections.

Firstly, we know the total sales for the craft store today are 36. According to the problem, 3/4 of the sales are in the jewelry section and 1/3 of the sales are in the fabric section.

Calculating the sales in the jewelry section:
\[ \text{Sales in jewelry section} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Calculating the sales in the fabric section:
\[ \text{Sales in fabric section} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

The rest of the sales go into the stationery section. To find this, we subtract the sales from the fabric and jewelry sections from the total sales:
\[ \text{Sales in stationery section} = 36 - (9 + 12) = 36 - 21 = 15 \]

So, the stationery section had 15 sales.

To find the number of sales in the stationery section, we first need to calculate the total sales in the fabric and jewelry sections. 

The fabric section makes up 1/3 of the sales, and the jewelry section makes up 1/4 of the sales. The stationery section makes up the remaining portion of the sales.

Let's calculate:

Fabric sales = 1/3 of total sales
Jewelry sales = 1/4 of total sales

Total sales = Fabric sales + Jewelry sales

Let's denote the total sales as \( T \) and the sales in each section as \( \text{F}{\text{fabric}} \), \( \text{J}{\text{jewelry}} \), and \( \text{S}{\text{stationery}} \).

\( T = \text{F}{\text{fabric}} + \text{J}{\text{jewelry}} + \text{S}{\text{stationery}} \)

Given \( T = 36 \), we can proceed similarly.

\( \text{F}{\text{fabric}} = \frac{1}{3} \times T \)
\( \text{J}{\text{jewelry}} = \frac{1}{4} \times T \)
\( \text{S}{\text{stationery}} = T - (\text{F}{\text{fabric}} + \text{J}{\text{jewelry}}) \)

\( \text{S}{\text{stationery}} = T - (\frac{1}{3} \times T + \frac{1}{4} \times T) \)

\( \text{S}{\text{stationery}} = T - (\frac{4+3}{12} \times T) \)

\( \text{S}{\text{stationery}} = T - (\frac{7}{12} \times T) \)

\( \text{S}{\text{stationery}} = \frac{5}{12} \times T \)

\( \text{S}{\text{stationery}} = \frac{5}{12} \times 36 \)

\( \text{S}{\text{stationery}} = 15 \)

Therefore, the stationery section made 15 sales today.

To determine the number of sales in the stationery section, we first need to calculate the number of sales in the fabric and jewelry sections based on the given percentages and total sales.

The total sales today are 36.

**Sales in the fabric section:**
\[
\frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
\]

**Sales in the jewelry section:**
\[
\frac{1}{4} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{4} = 9
\]

Next, we find the total sales in the fabric and jewelry sections:
\[
12 + 9 = 21
\]

The rest of the sales are in the stationery section. Therefore, we can find the number of sales in the stationery section by subtracting the sum of fabric and jewelry sales from the total sales:
\[
36 - 21 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of sales in the stationery section is:
\[
\boxed{15}

The craft store's sales distribution is as follows:
- Fabric: 1/3 of total sales
- Jewelry: 1/4 of total sales
- Stationery: Remaining sales

We are given that the store made 36 sales today. Let the total sales be \( Total\ Sales \).

First, let's find the fraction of sales that are in the stationery section:
\[ \text{Stationery} = Total\ Sales - (\text{Fabric} + \text{Jewelry}) \]

Since the fabric sales are \(\frac{1}{3}\) of total sales, and the jewelry sales are \(\frac{1}{4}\) of total sales, it follows that:
\[ \text{Stationery} = Total\ Sales - (\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}) \]
\[ \text{Stationery} = Total\ Sales - (\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}) \]
\[ \text{Stationery} = Total\ Sales - (\frac{7}{12}) \]

Since the total sales amount to 36, we can calculate the stationery sales by:
\[ \text{Stationery} = 36 - (\frac{7}{12} \times 36) \]
\[ \text{Stationery} = 36 - 21 \]
\[ \text{Stationery} = 15 \]

Therefore, 15 sales were in the stationery section.

To find the number of sales in the stationery section, first let's denote the total sales for today as \( T \). Given that \( T = 36 \) sales.

We know:
- Fabric section sales = \( \frac{1}{3} \) of total sales
- Jewelry section sales = \( \frac{1}{4} \) of total sales

1. Calculate the sales in the fabric section:
\[
\text{Fabric sales} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \text{ sales}
\]

2. Calculate the sales in the jewelry section:
\[
\text{Jewelry sales} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \text{ sales}
\]

3. The rest of the sales are in the stationery section. To find the number of stationery sales, we first calculate the total sales in the fabric and jewelry sections and then subtract from the total sales.

\[
\text{Total sales in fabric and jewelry} = \text{Fabric sales} + \text{Jewelry sales} = 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ sales}
\]

4. Finally, subtract the total sales in the fabric and jewelry sections from the total sales to find the stationery sales:

\[
\text{Stationery sales} = T - \text{Total sales in fabric and jewelry} = 36 - 21 = 15 \text{ sales}
\]

Therefore, the total number of sales in the stationery section is 15.

To find out how many sales were in the stationery section, we first need to determine the portion of sales that go into the fabric and jewelry sections. 

The fabric section receives 1/3 of the sales, and the jewelry section receives 1/4 of the sales. 

Therefore, the stationery section receives the remaining sales, which can be calculated by subtracting the sum of the fabric and jewelry sales from the total sales.

Finally, we divide the stationery sales by the total sales to find the number of sales in the stationery section.

Let's calculate:

Total sales = 36

Sales in the fabric section = 1/3 * 36 = 12
Sales in the jewelry section = 1/4 of 36 = 9

Now, we calculate the sales in the stationery section:

Sales in the stationery section = Total sales - (Sales in fabric section + Sales in jewelry section)

Sales in the stationery section = 36 - (12 + 9)

Sales in the stationery section = 36 - 21

Sales in the stationery section = 15

Therefore, 15 sales were made in the stationery section today.

To determine the number of sales in the stationery section, we first need to calculate the number of sales in the fabric and jewelry sections.

Step 1: Calculate the sales in the fabric section.
Sales in the fabric section = (1/3) * total sales = (1/3) * 36 = 12 sales

Step 2: Calculate the sales in the jewelry section.
Sales in the jewelry section = (1/4) * total sales = (1/4) * 36 = 9 sales

Step 3: Calculate the sales in the stationery section.
Total sales = Sales in fabric + Sales in jewelry + Sales in stationery
36 = 12 + 9 + Sales in stationery

Now, we solve for Sales in stationery:

Sales in stationery = Total sales - (Sales in fabric + Sales in jewelry)
Sales in stationery = 36 - (12 + 9)
Sales in stationery = 36 - 21
Sales in stationery = 15 sales

Therefore, the number of sales in the stationery section is 15.
