###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Randy just turned 12 and started playing the piano. His friend Sheila told him about the 10,000-hour rule which says, after 10,000 hours of practice, you become an expert or master in your field. If Randy wants to become a piano expert before he is 20, how many hours a day will he need to practice if he practices every day, Monday – Friday, and takes two weeks off for vacation each year?

#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Randy has 8 years to practice (since he is turning 12 and will be 20). There are 260 days in 2 years, 170 days in 1 year, and 52 days in 2 weeks. 8 years * 260 days = 2,080 days of practice needed. 2,080 days / 52 weeks / 7 days per week = 60 days per year. 10,000 hours / 60 days = 167 hours per year. 167 hours / 52 weeks / 7 days per week = 4.41 hours per day.

#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####

system
Randy practices from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, which is a total of 3 hours. He practices 5 days a week. Since there are 2 vacation weeks each year, he practices for 52 - 2 * 2 = 48 weeks in a year. This results in 3 hours/day * 5 days/week * 48 weeks/year = 720 hours/year. To become an expert, Randy will need 10,000 hours of practice. Since he needs 720 hours per year, he needs 10,000 hours / 720 hours/year = 13.89 years.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####

system
Randy wants to reach 10,000 hours before he is 20 years old, which translates to 1,666.67 hours per year. Since he has 8 years to practice (from age 12 to 20), he needs to accumulate:

\[ 1666.67 \times 8 = 13333.36 \text{ hours} \]

He practices Monday through Friday, so he practices 5 days a week, which gives him:

\[ 5 \times 52 = 260 \text{ weeks} \]

That's 13,200 hours if he practices five days a week. To reach 13,333.36 hours, he needs to:

\[ 13,333.36 - 13,200 = 133.36 \text{ more hours} \]

He will practice for 8 years, or:

\[ 52 \times 8 = 416 \text{ weeks} \]

To find out how many hours a day he needs to practice to accumulate 133.36 hours, we divide the additional hours needed by the total number of weeks he will practice:

\[ \frac{133.36}{416} \approx 0.32257 \text{ hours per day} \]

After finding his pattern, Randy needs to practice 1 practice at 8 hours a day for a total of 8 * 15 = 120 hours. He needs to practice 120 hours – 1,000 hours = 1,120 hours to make it to the 10,000-hour mark. Randy is going to practice for 20 – 2 = 18 years. Randy would need to practice 1,120 hours / 18 years = 62.77 hours a year. Randy needs to practice 62.77 hours a year / 5 days a week = 12.5556 hours a day.

#### GENERATION 7 RESPONSE ####


system
Randy starts practicing at age 12 and wants to become an expert by age 20, which means he has 8 years to become an expert (20 - 12 = 8).

He already has 2 years of practice under his belt, so he needs an additional 6 years to become an expert.

10,000 hours of practice spread out over 8 years totals to 1250 hours per year.

If he practices every day, Monday – Friday, with two weeks off, he practices 5 days a week, 52 weeks/year, which totals 260 days a year.

He needs to practice 1250 hours per year, so he will need 1250/260 = 4.78 days per year practicing.

So to become an expert, Randy will need to practice 4.78 days a year or 4.78 x 52 = 251.16 days in 8 years.

If he takes 2 weeks off for vacations every year, he takes 2 * 52 = 104 days off per year.

To practice all 8 years, Randy will need to take 104 days x 8 years = 832 days off.

So he will need to practice 251.16 x 8 = 2,010.08 days.

Randy will need to practice 2,010.08 days to become an expert on the piano before he is 20.

#### GENERATION 9 RESPONSE ####

system
Randy has 4 years to become an expert, with 2 weeks off each year, so he has 24 weeks to practice. This is equal to 24/4 = 6 years of practice.

30 years of experience is the minimum to be considered an expert, that is 30 years - 6 years of practice = 24 years left to reach the goal, to reach 10, 000 hours.

So, 10,000/24 = 417 hours.

We need to practice 417/150 = 2. 78 hours a day on Friday + Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday.

<answer>
2. 78
</answer>
<reasoning>
Randy has 6 years of practice to reach his goal. He takes two weeks off each year for vacation. That makes 8 weeks a year that Randy practices. 24 weeks per year is 24/8 = 3 months. Randy needs to practice 10, 000 hours - 12 years * 60 hours per year = 3, 800 hours. He practices 417 hours per year. So he needs to practice 417/150 = 2. 78 hours a day on Friday + Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday.
