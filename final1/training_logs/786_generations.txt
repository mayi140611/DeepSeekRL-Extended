Zion made a triangular-shaped house of cards with the base having a measurement of 40 centimeters and a height of 20 centimeters. If two of his friends also built similar shaped houses, what's the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made (the area of a triangle is 1/2 * width * height)?

<reasoning>
Zion's triangular house of cards has a base of 40 centimeters and a height of 20 centimeters. The area of Zion's house is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Area of Zion's house} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \times 20 = 400 \text{ square centimeters}
\]

Since two of his friends also built similar shaped houses, and each of their houses also has a base of 40 centimeters and a height of 20 centimeters, the area of each of their houses is also 400 square centimeters. Therefore, each friend's house also has an area of 400 square centimeters. 

To find the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made, we need to add the areas of all the houses together:

\[
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of Zion's house} + \text{Area of each friend's house} + \text{Area of each friend's house} = 400 + 400 + 400 = 1200 \text{ square centimeters}
\]

So, the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made is 1200 square centimeters.

To find the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made, we first need to calculate the area of one triangular house and then multiply it by the total number of houses.

The formula for the area of a triangle is given by \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).

Given:
- Base (\( b \)) = 40 centimeters
- Height (\( h \)) = 20 centimeters

First, calculate the area of one triangular house:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} = 2 \times 40 \times 20 = 1600 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Since Zion and his two friends each built a triangular house, the total area for three houses is:
\[ 3 \times 1600 \, \text{cm}^2 = 4800 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Therefore, the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made is 4800 square centimeters.

To find the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made, we first need to calculate the area of one triangular house and then multiply it by the number of houses (3 in this case).

The formula for the area of a triangle is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Given that the base is 40 cm and the height is 20 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \times 20 \]

\[ \text{Area} = 20 \times 20 \]

\[ \text{Area} = 400 \text{ square centimeters} \]

Since Zion and his two friends each built one house, there are 3 houses in total. Therefore, the total area is:
\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ square centimeters} \]

So, the total area of the triangular houses is 1200 square centimeters.

First, we need to calculate the area of one triangular house of cards. The formula for the area of a triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). 

For Zion's house, the base is 40 centimeters and the height is 20 centimeters. So, the area of Zion's house is:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{Zion}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} = \frac{1}{2} \times 800 \, \text{cm}^2 = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Zion's two friends also built similar houses, so each friend’s house will also have an area of 400 cm².

Total area for Zion and his friends' houses is:
\[ \text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_{\text{Zion}} + \text{Area}_{\text{each friend}} + \text{Area}_{\text{each friend}} \]
\[ \text{Total Area} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 + 400 \, \text{cm}^2 + 400 \, \text{cm}^2 \]
\[ \text{Total Area} = 1200 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Therefore, the total area for all the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made is \(1200 \, \text{cm}^2\).

First, we need to calculate the area of Zion's triangular-shaped house of cards. The formula for the area of a triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).

Given:
- Base = 40 cm
- Height = 20 cm

Substituting the given values into the formula:
\[ \text{Area of Zion's house} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Since Zion has two friends, each building a similar shaped house:
\[ \text{Area of one friend's house} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 \]
\[ \text{Total area for one friend} = 2 \times 400 \, \text{cm}^2 = 800 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Each friend also has two friends, so:
\[ \text{Total area for two friends} = 2 \times 800 \, \text{cm}^2 = 1600 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Now, let's add Zion's house area to the combined area of both friends' houses.
\[ \text{Zion's house area} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 \]
\[ \text{Total area of houses built by Zion's friends} = 1600 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Adding these together:
\[ \text{Total area of all houses} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 + 1600 \, \text{cm}^2 = 2000 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

So, the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made is 2000 square centimeters.

Since two of his friends also built triangular houses, the total area of the houses made by Zion and his friends is the sum of the areas of Zion’s house and the areas of the two houses made by his friends. Since the houses made by his friends are identical, the area of each of the houses made by his friends is also 400 cm². Therefore, the total area is:

Since there are 3 triangular houses, the total area is:

\[ \text{Total Area} = 1200 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Therefore, the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made is \( 1200 \text{ cm}^2 \).

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Given that the base of each triangle is 40 centimeters and the height is 20 centimeters, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} = \frac{1}{2} \times 800 = 400 \, \text{cm}^2

\[
\text{Total Area} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 + 400 \, \text{cm}^2 + 400 \, \text{cm}^2 = 1200 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

However, we must be careful because the area calculation for the friends' houses should consider their individual heights. Each friend's house has the same dimensions but different heights. For simplicity, let's assume one of the friends made a house with the same base and height as Zion's, and the other friend made a house with a height that we need to determine.

To find the height of the friends' house, we need more information about the dimensions of each house. Since the problem does not specify the height of the friend’s houses, we are assuming that the friend's houses have different heights, and their heights were not provided. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact area for each friend without additional information.

If we assume each friend's house is identical to Zion's and the friends' heights are not given, we would calculate the area of Zion's own house and assume each friend's house has the same area. However, since the problem does not provide the height of the friends' houses, we can't definitively calculate the total area for Zion and his friends.

The area of one triangular house of cards can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). Given that the base is 40 cm and the height is 20 cm, the area of one triangular house is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 40 \times 20 = 400\) square centimeters.

If Zion and his two friends each built a similar triangular house, then the total area for all three houses combined is \(3 \times 400\) square centimeters. Therefore, the total area is \(1200\) square centimeters.

Now, let's calculate this in steps.

The area of one triangular house is:
