To find the total number of sides on all the cookie cutters in the drawer, we need to calculate the number of sides for each type of cookie cutter and then sum them up.

1. **Triangles**: Each triangle has 3 sides.
   - There are 6 triangles.
   - Total sides for triangles = \(6 \text{ triangles} \times 3 \text{ sides/triangle} = 18 \text{ sides}\).

2. **Squares**: Each square has 4 sides.
   - There are 4 squares.
   - Total sides for squares = \(4 \text{ squares} \times 4 \text{ sides/square} = 16 \text{ sides}\).

3. **Hexagons**: Each hexagon has 6 sides.
   - There are 2 hexagons.
   - Total sides for hexagons = \(2 \text{ hexagons} \times 6 \text{ sides/hexagon} = 12 \text{ sides}\).

Now, we add up the total number of sides for all the cookie cutters:

- Total sides for triangles = 18
- Total sides for squares = 16
- Total sides for hexagons = 12

Total number of sides = \(18 + 16 + 12 = 46\)

Therefore, the total number of sides on the cookie cutters is **46**.

To find the total number of sides on all the cookie cutters, we can break it down by the shapes and their corresponding sides:

- Triangles have 3 sides.
- Squares have 4 sides.
- Hexagons have 6 sides.

There are 6 triangle cookie cutters, 4 square cookie cutters, and 2 hexagon cookie cutters.

So, the total number of sides from triangles is:
\( 6 \text{ triangles} \times 3 \text{ sides/triangle} = 18 \text{ sides} \)

The total number of sides from squares is:
\( 4 \text{ squares} \times 4 \text{ sides/square} = 16 \text{ sides} \)

The total number of sides from hexagons is:
\( 2 \text{ hexagons} \times 6 \text{ sides/hexagon} = 12 \text{ sides} \)

Now, we add them all together to get the total number of sides:
\( 18 \text{ sides} + 16 \text{ sides} + 12 \text{ sides} = 46 \text{ sides} \)

To find the total number of sides on the cookie cutters, we can proceed with the following reasoning:

1. Each triangle has 3 sides.
2. Each square has 4 sides.
3. Each hexagon has 6 sides.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sides by multiplying the number of each shape by the number of sides in that shape and then summing them up:

- For triangles: \(6 \times 3 = 18\) sides
- For squares: \(4 \times 4 = 16\) sides
- For hexagons: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) sides

Adding these together: \(18 + 16 + 12 = 46\) sides.

To find the total number of sides on the cookie cutters, we need to consider the number and shape of each type of cutter:

1. Triangles have 3 sides.
2. Squares have 4 sides.
3. Hexagons have 6 sides.

Now we calculate the total number of sides:

- Triangles: 6 cookie cutters * 3 sides = 18 sides
- Squares: 4 cookie cutters * 4 sides = 16 sides
- Hexagons: 2 cookie cutters * 6 sides = 12 sides

Summing these up gives us the total number of sides:

18 sides (from triangles) + 16 sides (from squares) + 12 sides (from hexagons) = 46 sides.

First, calculate the total number of sides for each shape:
- For the triangles, 3 sides each, so 6 triangles * 3 sides = 18 sides.
- For the squares, 4 sides each, so 4 squares * 4 sides = 16 sides.
- For the hexagons, 6 sides each, so 2 hexagons * 6 sides = 12 sides.

Next, add up all sides:
18 sides (from triangles) + 16 sides (from squares) + 12 sides (from hexagons) = 46 sides in total.

To find the total number of sides on all the cookie cutters, we need to calculate the number of sides for each type of cutter and then sum them up.

1. **Triangles**: Each triangle has 3 sides. Since there are 6 triangles:
   \[
   6 \text{ triangles} \times 3 \text{ sides/triangle} = 18 \text{ sides}
   \]

2. **Squares**: Each square has 4 sides. Since there are 4 squares:
   \[
   4 \text{ squares} \times 4 \text{ sides/square} = 16 \text{ sides}
   \]

3. **Hexagons**: Each hexagon has 6 sides. Since there are 2 hexagons:
   \[
   2 \text{ hexagons} \times 6 \text{ sides/hexagon} = 12 \text{ sides}
   \]

Now we sum up the sides from all types of cookie cutters:
\[
18 \text{ sides (triangles)} + 16 \text{ sides (squares)} + 12 \text{ sides (hexagons)} = 46 \text{ sides}
\]

So, the total number of sides on the cookie cutters is 46.

To find the total number of sides on the cookie cutters, we start by noting the number of sides each type of cookie cutter has:

- Triangles have \(3\) sides
- Squares have \(4\) sides
- Hexagons have \(6\) sides

Next, we calculate the total number of sides for each type of cookie cutter:

- Triangle cutters: \(6 \text{ cutters} \times 3 \text{ sides per cutter} = 18 \text{ sides}\)
- Square cutters: \(4 \text{ cutters} \times 4 \text{ sides per cutter} = 16 \text{ sides}\)
- Hexagon cutters: \(2 \text{ cutters} \times 6 \text{ sides per cutter} = 12 \text{ sides}\)

Now, we sum the sides from all the cutters to get the total number of sides:

\(18 \text{ sides} + 16 \text{ sides} + 12 \text{ sides} = 46 \text{ sides}\)

Thus, the total number of sides on the cookie cutters is \(46\).

To find the total number of sides of the cookie cutters, we first calculate the number of sides per type of cookie cutter and then multiply by the number of each type.

A triangle has 3 sides. Since Emery has 6 triangle-shaped cookie cutters, the total number of sides from the triangles is \(6 \times 3 = 18\) sides.

A square has 4 sides. For the square-shaped cookie cutters, the total number of sides is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) sides.

A hexagon has 6 sides. For the hexagon-shaped cookie cutters, the total number of sides is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) sides.

Now we add the sides from all the cookie cutters together: \(18 + 16 + 12 = 46\) sides.

Therefore, the total number of sides on the cookie cutters is 46.

To find the total number of sides, we can add up the sides from each type of cookie cutter:

- Triangles have 3 sides each, and there are 6 of them, so \(6 \times 3 = 18\) sides from triangles.
- Squares have 4 sides each, and there are 4 of them, so \(4 \times 4 = 16\) sides from squares.
- Hexagons have 6 sides each, and there are 2 of them, so \(2 \times 6 = 12\) sides from hexagons.

Adding these together gives us the total number of sides:

\[18 + 16 + 12 = 46\]
