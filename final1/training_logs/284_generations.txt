###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Matt buys a massager.  At the lowest setting, it vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second.  At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster.  Matt uses it for 5 minutes at the highest setting.  How many vibrations does he experience?

#### ANS ####

768000
#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
At the highest setting, the massager vibrates at 1600 + (1600 * 0.60) = 2560 vibrations per second.
There are 60 * 5 = 300 seconds in 5 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is 2560 * 300 = 768000.

system
At the highest setting, the massager vibrates 60% faster than at the lowest setting. To find out how much faster, we calculate 60% of 1600:

\( 1600 \times 0.60 = 960 \)

So, at the highest setting, the massager vibrates at:

\( 1600 + 960 = 2560 \) vibrations per second.

Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes, which is equal to \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \) seconds.

To find the total number of vibrations Matt experiences, we multiply the number of vibrations per second by the total number of seconds:

\( 2560 \times 300 = 768000 \)

Therefore, Matt experiences 768,000 vibrations.

system
First, we need to determine the number of vibrations per second at the highest setting. Since the highest setting is 60% faster than the lowest setting, we calculate 60% of 1600 vibrations per second and add it to the original 1600 vibrations per second:

\[ 1600 + 0.60 \times 1600 = 1600 + 960 = 2560 \text{ vibrations per second} \]

Next, we calculate the number of vibrations Matt experiences when he uses the massager for 5 minutes at the highest setting. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 minutes is equal to:

\[ 5 \times 60 = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the total number of vibrations Matt experiences is:

\[ 2560 \times 300 = 768,000 \text{ vibrations} \]

At the highest setting, the massager vibrates 60% faster than 1600 vibrations per second, which is 1600 * 0.60 = 960 more vibrations per second.
So at the highest setting, it vibrates 1600 + 960 = 2560 vibrations per second.
Matt uses it for 5 minutes, which is 5 * 60 = 300 seconds.
So in 300 seconds, Matt experiences 300 * 2560 = 768000 vibrations.

At the highest setting, the massager vibrates 60% faster than at the lowest setting. The lowest setting is 1600 vibrations per second. To find the number of vibrations per second at the highest setting, we calculate 1600 * 1.60 = 2560.

Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes, which is equivalent to 5 * 60 = 300 seconds.

The total number of vibrations Matt experiences is 2560 * 300 = 768000.

At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster, which is \(1600 \times 0.60 = 960\) additional vibrations per second.

So at the highest setting, it vibrates \(1600 + 960 = 2560\) vibrations per second.

Matt uses it for 5 minutes, which is equivalent to \(5 \times 60 = 300\) seconds.

Therefore, the total number of vibrations is \(2560 \times 300 = 768000\).

system
At the highest setting, the massager vibrates 60% faster than at the lowest setting. First, we need to determine the increased speed at the highest setting compared to the lowest setting.

1600 vibrations per second * 60% = 960 additional vibrations per second

So, at the highest setting, it vibrates at 1600 + 960 = 2560 vibrations per second.

Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes at the highest setting, so first we need to convert 5 minutes to seconds:

5 minutes * 60 seconds = 300 seconds

Now we can multiply the vibrations per second by the number of seconds:

2560 vibrations/second * 300 seconds = 768,000 vibrations

Therefore, Matt experiences 768,000 vibrations at the highest setting.
