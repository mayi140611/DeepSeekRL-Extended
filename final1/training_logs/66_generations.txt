To determine Tara's balance after making 4 monthly installments of $65, we need to first calculate her initial down payment and then subtract that from the total cost of the laptop.

1. Calculate the initial down payment:
   - The laptop costs $1000.
   - A 20% down payment is 20% of $1000.
   - Down payment = 0.20 * $1000 = $200.
   
2. Determine the new down payment amount:
   - Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment.
   - New down payment = Down payment + Additional $20 = $200 + $20 = $220.
   
3. Calculate the total amount paid for 4 months:
   - Monthly installment = $65.
   - Total amount paid for 4 months = 4 * $65 = $260.
   
4. Determine the remaining balance after 4 months:
   - Total cost of the laptop = $1000.
   - Remaining balance = Total cost - New down payment - Total amount paid = $1000 - $220 - $260 = $520.

Therefore, Tara's balance after making 4 monthly installments is $520.

Here's how to solve this problem:

1. The original total cost of the laptop is $1000.
2. The shop asks for a 20% down payment. This means the down payment is $1000 * 20% = $200.
3. If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, the total amount she needs to pay toward the down payment is $200 + $20 = $220.

4. The remaining balance after the down payment is $1000 - $220 = $780.

5. Tara has to pay in installments of $65 per month for 4 months.

6. Therefore, the total amount paid within 4 months is $65 * 4 = $260.

7. Now, to find her balance after 4 months, we subtract the total amount paid from her remaining balance: $780 - $260 = $520.

So, Tara's balance after paying for 4 months is $520.

<reasoning>
Tara must pay a 20% down payment to get a 12-month installment plan. First, calculate the 20% down payment and add an additional $20 for the total down payment. Then calculate the balance after the first 4 payments. Use the installment plan figure to calculate the balance after 4 payments.
</reasoning>

<answer>
The 20% down payment on the laptop costs $200. Adding the $20 down payment of additional cost to the $200 gives a total down payment of $220. Subtracting the down payment from the original price of the laptop gives her balance of $780. After the first 4 payments, her balance is $780 - $260 = $520.

To determine Tara's balance after 4 months of monthly payments for a laptop that costs $1000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial down payment.
2. Calculate the total amount paid after 4 months.
3. Subtract the initial down payment and the total amount paid from the total cost of the laptop to find her balance.

Step 1: Calculate the initial down payment.
The down payment is 20% of $1000.
\[ \text{Initial down payment} = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]
Since Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, the total down payment is:
\[ 200 + 20 = 220 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid after 4 months.
Tara pays $65 per month for 4 months.
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Step 3: Subtract the initial down payment and the total amount paid from the total cost of the laptop to find her balance.
\[ \text{Balance} = 1000 - 220 - 260 = 520 \]

Therefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is \(\boxed{520}\).

To determine Tara's balance after 4 months of monthly installments of $65 each and the additional $20 for the down payment, we need to perform the following calculations:

1. **Calculate the down payment:**
   - Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment.
   - Total cost of the laptop: $1000.
   - Down payment: $1000 + $20 = $1020.

2. **Calculate the remaining balance after the down payment:**
   - Total cost of the laptop: $1000.
   - Down payment: $1020.
   - Remaining balance: $1000 - $1020 = -$20 (This indicates that Tara needs $20 more to reach the full cost of the laptop).

3. **Calculate the total amount paid in installments over 4 months:**
   - Monthly installment: $65.
   - Number of months: 4.
   - Total installment amount: $65 * 4 = $260.

Since Tara still owes $20 after the down payment, her balance after paying for 4 months will remain unchanged at $20.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total down payment.
2. Calculate the total amount paid in installments for 4 months.
3. Subtract the down payment and total amount paid in installments from the original price of the laptop to find the balance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total down payment.**

The down payment is 20% of $1000, and Tara wants to increase this amount by $20.

- 20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200
- Total down payment = $200 + $20 = $220

Now, let's calculate the installments for 4 months.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid in installments for 4 months.**

The shop accepts installments of $65 per month.

- Amount paid in 4 months = $65 * 4 = $260

**Step 3: Calculate the balance after paying for 4 months.**

The original price of the laptop is $1000, so the balance after the down payment and installment payments can be found by subtracting the down payment and total installment payments from the total price.

- Total installment payments = $260
- Total balance = $1000 - $220 (down payment) - $260 (installment payments)
- Total balance = $1000 - $220 - $260 = $520

Therefore, the balance after paying for 4 months is $520.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total cost of the laptop**: The laptop costs $1000.

2. **Down payment required**: The shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month for a 20% down payment.
   - Down payment amount: \( 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \) dollars
   - Additional down payment: \( 200 + 20 = 220 \) dollars

3. **Installment amount**: The remaining amount after the down payment is:
   - Remaining amount before installment: \( 1000 - 220 = 780 \) dollars
   - Monthly installment: \( 780 / 4 = 195 \) dollars

4. **Monthly payments for 4 months**: Tara will make monthly payments of $195 for 4 months.
   - Total installment cost after 4 months: \( 195 \times 4 = 780 \) dollars

5. **Final balance after 4 months**: Subtract the total installment cost from the remaining amount after the down payment.
   - Final balance: \( 220 - 780 = -560 \) dollars

Therefore, Tara's balance after paying for 4 months will be -$560.

Tara has initially been planning to buy a laptop costing $1000, but she is willing to make a down payment of 20% of $1000. Let's calculate 20% of $1000:

\[ 20\% \times \$1000 = 0.20 \times \$1000 = \$200 \]

Since Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, the total down payment she will make is:

\[ \$200 + \$20 = \$220 \]

Now, we subtract the down payment from the total cost of the laptop to find her remaining balance, which is:

\[ \$1000 - \$220 = \$780 \]

Tara is paying monthly installments of $65. Over the course of 4 months, her total payments will be:

Tara plans to buy a laptop costing $1000 at a monthly installment of $65 over 10 months. This is the initial down payment because the down payment is a total of $1000 at a 20% discount for 10 installments. Therefore, the amount of down payment Tara needs to make is $1000 * 20% = $200. Because this additional down payment is greater than $200, Tara has to pay the full down payment, which is $400 ($200 * 2). As a result, Tara needs to pay $1000 as the remaining balance after the down payment. Because Tara is making a monthly payment of $65 per month for 4 months, the total amount paid within 4 months is $65 * 4 = $260. As a result, Tara's remaining balance is calculated by subtracting the total amount paid from the remaining balance after the down payment. This can be calculated as $1000 - $400 - $260 = $340.
