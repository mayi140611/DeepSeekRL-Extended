Let's break this down step by step:

1. James played a total of 5 rounds, each with 5 questions, so the total number of questions is 5 rounds * 5 questions/round = 25 questions.
2. For each correct answer, a student gets 2 points. Since James missed one question, he missed 1 question * 2 points/question = 2 points.
3. For each correct answer, there's an additional 4 point bonus. Since James got 25 questions right, he earned 25 questions * 4 points/question = 100 bonus points.
4. Therefore, James's total points are the points from correct answers minus the points from missed questions plus the bonus points: 25 questions * 2 points/question - 2 points + 100 bonus points = 50 + 100 = 150 points.

To determine the number of points James earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the points James earns from correctly answering all questions in a round, including the bonus for answering all questions.
2. Calculate the points James earns from answering all questions in five rounds.
3. Calculate the points James earns from answering all questions in three of the five rounds.
4. Subtract the missed question from the total points to find out how many points he earned.

Let's break it down:

- Each round consists of 5 questions.
- James earns 2 points per question, and in addition, he gets a 4-point bonus for answering all questions in a round.
- Therefore, in each round where he answers all questions correctly, he earns \(5 \times 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14\) points.

Since there are 5 rounds and James only missed one question, he answered all questions in 4 rounds correctly. So, for these 4 rounds, he earns \(4 \times 14 = 56\) points. For the fifth round, he answers only 4 questions correctly, so he earns \(4 \times 2 = 8\) points.

Now, let's calculate the total points James earned:

- Points from 4 rounds where he answered all questions correctly: \(4 \times 14 = 56\)
- Points from answering all questions in the fifth round where he answered 4 questions correctly: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)

Total points = \(56 + 8 = 64\).

The total number of questions is 5*5=25 questions. The total points he earns for each round is 25*2=50 points. Each round he earns an extra 4 points, thus for 5 rounds he earns 4*5=20 extra points. If he missed only one question, then he gets 25-1=24 questions and the bonus of 24*2=48 extra points. The total points he got is 24*2+48+50*5=262 points.

The total number of questions in the quiz is 5 rounds * 5 questions/round = 25 questions. James missed 1 question, so he got 24 questions right. Thus, he gets 24 questions * 2 points/question = 48 points. He also gets a 4-point bonus each time he gets all questions right, so he gets a 4-point bonus of 4 points/bonus * 1 bonus = 4 points. Thus, James got 48 points + 4 points = 52 total points.

The total number of questions in the quiz bowl for each round is 5 questions.

James correctly answered 5 questions per round and got a 4 point bonus for each correctly answered round. He missed 1 question, so he missed a round. The correct number of points per round without the bonus is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) points.

With the bonus, the number of points per correctly answered round is \(5 + 4 = 9\) points.

Since he missed one round, he correctly answered \(4\) rounds. Therefore, the total number of points he earned is \(4 \times 9 + 1 \times 10 = 36 + 10 = 46\).

To determine how many points James earned, we need to calculate the points from correctly answered questions and bonus points accordingly. Each round consists of 5 questions, and he gets 2 points for each correct answer. Since he missed one question, he answered 4 questions correctly in each round. Each round has a 4-point bonus if he answers all questions correctly.

First, calculate the points from correctly answered questions in one round:
\[ 4 \text{ questions} \times 2 \text{ points/question} = 8 \text{ points} \]

Next, calculate the bonus points for a round where he answered all questions correctly:
\[ 1 \text{ round} \times 4 \text{ bonus points/round} = 4 \text{ bonus points} \]

Now, add the points from correctly answered questions and the bonus points for one round:
\[ 8 \text{ points} + 4 \text{ bonus points} = 12 \text{ points} \]

Since there are five rounds, multiply the points per round by 5:
\[ 12 \text{ points/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} = 60 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, James earned a total of 60 points.

James answered a total of \(5 \times 5 = 25\) questions. Since he missed one question, he answered \(25 - 1 = 24\) questions correctly. For each correct answer, he earns 2 points, so he gets \(24 \times 2 = 48\) points from correct answers. James also gets a 4 point bonus for answering all questions in a round, and since there are five rounds, he gets \(5 \times 4 = 20\) bonus points.

The total points James gets is the sum of the points from correct answers and bonus points, which is \(48 + 20 = 68\) points.

#### GENERATION 9 RESPONSE ####

First, we need to determine the total number of questions in the quiz. There are 5 rounds with 5 questions each, so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) questions. Since James missed one question, he answered \(25 - 1 = 24\) questions.

In each round, students earn 2 points for each correct answer, but they earn an additional 4 points if they correctly answer all questions in a round. Since James didn't answer all questions in a round, he doesn't earn the bonus points for that round.

For the rounds he did answer, he earned \(24\) questions \(\times 2\) points per correct answer = \(48\) points.

Adding his bonus points from the rounds he answered, he gets \(48 + (5 - 1) \times 4 = 48 + 4 \times 4 = 48 + 16 = 64\) points.

Therefore, the answer is 64.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Each round consists of 5 questions.
2. A student earns 2 points for each correct answer.
3. If a student correctly answers all the questions in a round, they get an additional 4 point bonus.
4. James missed one question out of 5.

For the 4 correct answers:
- Points = 4 * 2 = 8 points
- Bonus = 4 * 4 = 0 points (since he missed 1 question, he didn't earn the bonus)

For the 1 missed question:
- Points lost = 1 * 2 = 2 points

Total points = Points earned + Bonus - Points lost
Total points = 8 + 0 - 2
Total points = 6

James scored 6 points.

To calculate the total points James earned, we need to first calculate the points he earned for getting all the questions right and then add the bonus points he earned for getting all the questions right in each round.

First, calculate the total points from correct answers:
- He got 4 questions right in each round (since he missed one). So, for each round, he earns 4 questions * 2 points/question = 8 points.
- He played 5 rounds, so he earns 5 rounds * 8 points/round = 40 points from correct answers.

Next, add the bonus points:
- For each round where he got all questions right, he earns an additional 4 points. Since he missed only one question, he gets bonuses for the other 4 rounds and 1 round where he got all questions right.
- The 4 rounds with a 4-point bonus: 4 rounds * 4 points/round = 16 points.
- The bonus for the round where he got all questions right: 1 round * 4 points/round = 4 points.

So, the total bonus points are 16 points + 4 points = 20 points.

Finally, add the bonus points to the points from correct answers:
40 points + 20 points = 60 points.

Therefore, the total points James earned.

To find out how many points James earned, we need to calculate the total number of questions he answered correctly, considering the bonus for answering all questions correctly.

1. Each round consists of 5 questions, making a total of \(5 \times 5 = 25\) questions for the quiz.
2. James missed only one question, so he answered \(25 - 1 = 24\) questions.
3. For each correct answer, he earns 2 points, so for 24 correct answers, he earns \(24 \times 2 = 48\) points.
4. Since he also answered all questions correctly in the fifth round, he is eligible for an additional 4 points bonus.
5. Therefore, the total points James earned is \(48 + 4 = 52\).

Now, let's summarize this calculation in a concise format:

To calculate the points James earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of questions James answered correctly.
2. Calculate the points from correct answers.
3. Determine the bonus points awarded for answering all questions correctly.
4. Add the points from correct answers and the bonus points to get the total points.

Step 1: James answered 4 questions correct per round (5 total questions - 1 missed question) and played 5 rounds.
   Questions correctly answered per round * Rounds = Total questions answered correctly
   4 * 5 = 20

Step 2: Each correct answer earns 2 points.
   Total points from correct answers = Questions correctly answered * Points per correct answer
   20 * 2 = 40

Step 3: Since there were no questions missed, the bonus is not applicable.
   Bonus points = 0

Step 4: Adding the points from correct answers and the bonus points to get the total points.
   Total points = Points from correct answers + Bonus points
   40 + 0 = 40

Therefore, James earned 40 points in total.
