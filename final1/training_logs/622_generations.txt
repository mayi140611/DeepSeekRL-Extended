system
To find out how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has compared to Lorene, we start by calculating how many pieces Lorene has. Since Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia, and Georgia has 25 pieces, Lorene has \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) pieces.

Next, we subtract the number of pieces Georgia has from the number Lorene has to find out how many fewer pieces Georgia has:

<reasoning>
Since Lorene has 75 pieces and Georgia has 25 pieces, we calculate the difference as follows:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of pieces Lorene has} - \text{Number of pieces Georgia has} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 75 - 25 = 50 \]
</reasoning>

Therefore, Georgia has fewer pieces of stationery than Lorene by 50 pieces.

To find out how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has than Lorene, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pieces Lorene has:**
   Georgia has 25 pieces of stationery. Lorene has three times as many pieces as Georgia.
   \[
   \text{Lorene's pieces} = 3 \times \text{Georgia's pieces} = 3 \times 25 = 75
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the difference between the number of pieces Lorene and Georgia have:**
   Lorene has 75 pieces, and Georgia has 25 pieces.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Lorene's pieces} - \text{Georgia's pieces}
   \]
   Substituting the values, we get:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 75 - 25 = 50
   \]

Therefore, Georgia has 50 fewer pieces of stationery than Lorene.

Let's calculate the number of pieces of stationery Lorene has first. Since Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia, we multiply Georgia's amount by 3:

Lorene's pieces of stationery = Georgia's pieces of stationery × 3
Lorene's pieces of stationery = 25 × 3
Lorene's pieces of stationery = 75

Now, to find how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has than Lorene, we subtract Georgia's number of pieces from Lorene's number of pieces:

Fewer pieces of stationery = Lorene's pieces - Georgia's pieces
Fewer pieces of stationery = 75 - 25
Fewer pieces of stationery = 50

Therefore, Georgia has 50 fewer pieces of stationery than Lorene.

To find how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has than Lorene, we first need to determine how many pieces Lorene has. Since Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia, we multiply the number of pieces Georgia has by 3.

\[
\text{Number of pieces Lorene has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pieces Georgia has}
\]

Georgia has 25 pieces of stationery. Therefore, the number of pieces Lorene has is:

\[
\text{Number of pieces Lorene has} = 3 \times 25 = 75
\]

Now, to find how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has than Lorene, we subtract the number of pieces Georgia has from the number of pieces Lorene has.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Number of pieces Lorene has} - \text{Number of pieces Georgia has}
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 75 - 25 = 50
\]

So, Georgia has 50 fewer pieces of stationery than Lorene.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Georgia has 25 pieces of stationery.
2. Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia.
   - If Georgia has 25 pieces, Lorene has \(3 \times 25 = 75\) pieces.
   - Let's verify it: \(75 \div 25 = 3\), which confirms Lorene indeed has three times as many pieces as Georgia.

Now, to find out how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has compared to Lorene:
- Lorene has 75 pieces.
- Georgia has 25 pieces.
- The difference is \(75 - 25 = 50\).

Therefore, Georgia has 50 fewer pieces of stationery than Lorene.

To find out how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has than Lorene, we first need to determine how many pieces of stationery Lorene has. Since Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia, we can calculate this by multiplying Georgia's amount by 3.

Georgia has 25 pieces of stationery.
Lorene's amount = Georgia's amount × 3 = 25 × 3 = 75 pieces.

Now we know that Lorene has 75 pieces, while Georgia has 25 pieces. To find out how many fewer pieces Lorene has than Georgia, we subtract the number of pieces Georgia has from the number Lorene has:

Difference = Lorene's amount - Georgia's amount = 75 - 25 = 50 pieces.
