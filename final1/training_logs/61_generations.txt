###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

A bear is preparing to hibernate for the winter and needs to gain 1000 pounds. At the end of summer, the bear feasts on berries and small woodland animals. During autumn, it devours acorns and salmon. It gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries during summer, and during autumn, it gained twice that amount from acorns. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight it had needed to gain. How many pounds did it gain eating small animals?

Let's break down the bear's weight gain during summer and autumn:

1. Initially, the bear needs to gain 1000 pounds.
2. At the end of summer, the bear gains a fifth of the remaining weight: \( \frac{1000}{5} = 200 \) pounds.
3. The remaining weight to be gained is: \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) pounds.

During autumn, the bear gains twice that amount from acorns: \( 2 \times 200 = 400 \) pounds.
4. The remaining weight to be gained is: \( 800 - 400 = 400 \) pounds.

Salmon made up half of the remaining weight, so 200 pounds were gained from salmon: \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds.

The remaining weight that the bear gained from small animals is the sum of the remaining non-salmon weight: \( 1000 - 200 \) pounds.

The bear needs to gain a fifth of this remaining weight in small animals: \( \frac{1000}{5} - 200 = 200 \) pounds.

The bear gained \( \boxed{200} \) pounds eating small animals.

To determine how many pounds the bear gained eating small animals, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weight gained from berries during summer.
2. Calculate the weight gained from acorns during autumn.
3. Determine the remaining weight needed after accounting for the berries and acorns.
4. Calculate the weight gained from salmon.
5. Determine the remaining weight needed after accounting for the salmon.
6. Calculate the weight gained from small animals.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. The bear needs to gain 1000 pounds total. In summer, it gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries.
   \[
   \text{Weight from berries} = \frac{1000}{5} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
2. In autumn, it gained twice the weight it gained from berries from acorns.
   \[
   \text{Weight from acorns} = 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The total weight gained so far from berries and acorns is:
   \[
   \text{Weight from berries + acorns} = 200 + 400 = 600 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   The remaining weight needed is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight} = 1000 - 600 = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight needed.
   \[
   \text{Weight from salmon} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
5. The remaining weight needed is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight} = 1000 - 400 - 200 = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   This remaining weight is gained from small animals.
   \[
   \text{Weight from small animals} = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the bear gained \boxed{400} pounds eating small animals.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total weight gain needed**: The bear needs to gain 1000 pounds.

2. **Weight gain from berries**:
   - The bear gains a fifth of the total weight from berries.
   - \( \frac{1000}{5} = 200 \) pounds.

3. **Weight gain from acorns**:
   - The bear gains twice the amount from acorns compared to berries.
   - \( 2 \times 200 = 400 \) pounds.

4. **Weight gain from salmon**:
   - Salmon made up half of the remaining weight needed after berries and acorns.
   - Total weight needed after berries and acorns: \( 1000 - 200 - 400 = 400 \) pounds.
   - Salmon gain: \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds.

5. **Weight gain from small animals**:
   - Given the bear originally gained a fifth from berries and twice that from acorns, and now salmon makes up half and the remaining from small animals.
   - The calculation should not be wrong because we need to find how much weight the bear gained from small animals to complete the 1000.

Putting the pieces together:
- From berries: \( 200 \) pounds.
- From acorns: \( 400 \) pounds.
- From salmon: \( 200 \) pounds.
- We have done the following:
\[
200 + 400 + 200 = 800
\]
- Therefore, the remaining \(1000\) pounds is from small animals:
\[
1000 - 800 = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

To summarize, the bear gained 200 pounds eating small animals.

1. **Weight Gain from Berries in Summer:**
   The bear gains a fifth of the total weight needed from berries during the summer.
   \[
   \text{Weight from berries} = \frac{1000}{5} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight Gain from Acorns in Autumn:**
   The bear gains twice the weight it gained from berries from acorns during autumn.
   \[
   \text{Weight from acorns} = 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Remaining Weight to Gain:**
   After gaining from berries and acorns, the bear is still 1000 - 200 - 400 = 400 pounds away from gaining the total weight needed.
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight} = 1000 - 600 = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight Gain from Salmon:**
   Salmon makes up half of the remaining weight needed.
   \[
   \text{Weight from salmon} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Weight Gain from Small Animals:**
   The rest of the weight needed is gained from small animals.
   \[
   \text{Weight from small animals} = \text{Remaining weight} - \text{Weight from salmon}
   \]
   Since the remaining weight is 400 pounds and Salmon gained 200 pounds:
   \[
   \text{Weight from small animals} = 400 - 200 = 200 \text{ pounds}

Let's break this down step by step:

1. The bear needs to gain a total of 1000 pounds.
2. During summer, it gains 1/5 of the total weight from berries, which is 1000/5 = 200 pounds.
3. The remaining weight needed is 1000 - 200 = 800 pounds.
4. During autumn, it gains twice that amount from acorns, which is 2*800 = 1600 pounds.
5. After the acorns, it still has 800 - 1600 = -800 pounds, which is not possible, so let's correct the logic.
6. Correcting the logic, after the acorns, it still has 800 pounds remaining to gain.
7. Salmon makes up half of the remaining weight (800/2 = 400 pounds).

Now, let's account for all the weight gained:

- Berries: 200 pounds
- Acorns: 1600 pounds
- Salmon: 400 pounds

Total weight gained = 200 + 1600 + 400 = 2200 pounds

So the bear gained 400 pounds eating small animals (including berries).

Therefore, the answer is 400 pounds.

To find out how many pounds the bear gained eating small animals, let's break down the problem:

1. The bear needs to gain a total of 1000 pounds.
2. In summer, it gained a fifth of the needed weight from berries, so it gained \( \frac{1000}{5} = 200 \) pounds from berries.
3. During autumn, it gained twice the amount from acorns, which is \( 2 \times 200 = 400 \) pounds from acorns.
4. The remaining weight it needs to gain after berries and acorns is \( 1000 - 200 - 400 = 400 \) pounds.
5. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight, so it gained \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds from salmon.

Now, to find out how many pounds it gained eating small animals, we subtract the weight gained from berries, acorns, and salmon from the total weight it needed to gain:

\( 1000 - (200 + 400 + 200) \)

\( 1000 - 800 = 200 \) pounds.

Next, let's calculate the weight the bear gained from acorns during autumn:
\[ \text{Weight from acorns} = 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ pounds} \]

After gaining from berries and acorns, the bear is still short:

After gaining from salmon, the bear is still short:
\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 1000 - 200 - 200 = 600 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the bear gained the remaining 600 pounds from eating small animals, the answer is:

Let's break down the problem:

1. Set up the problem with the total weight the bear needs to gain (1000 pounds).
2. The bear gained a fifth of the needed weight from berries during summer.
3. Then, the bear gained twice that amount (from berries) from acorns during autumn.
4. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight needed.
5. Finally, calculate the weight gained from small animals.

Let's calculate the weight the bear gained from each item:

- Weight from berries (B) = 1000 pounds / 5
- Weight from acorns (A) = 2 * (Weight from berries)
- Weight from salmon (S) = Half of the remaining weight needed
- Weight from small animals (SA) = The total weight needed (1000 pounds) - (Weight from berries + Weight from acorns + Weight from salmon)

Now let's calculate the individual values:

B = 1000 / 5 = 200 pounds
A = 2 * 200 = 400 pounds
S = 1000 / 2 = 500 pounds (half of the remaining needed weight after considering berries and acorns)

Now, calculate the weight gained from small animals:

SA = 1000 - (B + A + S)
SA = 1000 - (200 + 400 + 500)
SA = 1000 - 1100
SA = -100 pounds (This seems incorrect, so let's recheck our understanding of the problem)

Upon reviewing, it seems the bear gained from acorns twice as much as berries, but considering the total weight needed and the fact it already had some weight from berries, we might need to double check the calculation logic. Let's correct:

A = 2 * (Weight from berries) = 2 * 200 = 400 pounds
S = 1/2 of the remaining weight needed = 1/2 * 1000 - Weight from acorns (correcting the logic)

Let's assume the bear gained weights from berries, acorns, and small animals in a correct proportional way:

B = 1000 / 5 = 200 pounds
A = 2 * 200 = 400 pounds
Let the weight from small animals (SA) be 'x'. The total weight gained from small animals (SA) would be the remaining weight not included in fruits or acorns.

SA = 1000 - B - A - (1/2 * (1000 - B - A))
SA = 1000 - 200 - 400 - (1/2 * (1000 - 200 - 400))

Let's re-calculate this:
SA = 1000 - 200 - 400 - 100
SA = 1000 - 700
SA = 300 pounds

So the bear gained 300 pounds from small animals.

The correct answer is 300 pounds.

To determine how many pounds the bear gained eating small animals, we need to calculate the weight it gained from each source of food and then find the remaining weight it needed to gain.

Let's denote the total weight the bear needed to gain as \( W \), which is 1000 pounds.

1. **Weight from berries:**
   The bear gained \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the total weight from berries.
   \[
   \text{Weight from berries} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   This leaves the bear \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) pounds to gain from other sources.

2. **Weight from acorns:**
   The bear gained twice the weight from acorns as it gained from berries.
   \[
   \text{Weight from acorns} = 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   This leaves the bear \( 800 - 400 = 400 \) pounds to gain from other sources.

3. **Weight from salmon:**
   The bear gained half the remaining weight from salmon.
   \[
   \text{Weight from salmon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   This leaves the bear \( 400 - 200 = 200 \) pounds to gain from other sources.

4. **Weight gained from small animals:**
   The remaining weight the bear needed to gain is from small animals.
   \[
   \text{Weight from small animals} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the bear gained \(\boxed{200}\) pounds eating small animals.
