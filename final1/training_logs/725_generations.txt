###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

John jogs at a speed of 4 miles per hour when he runs alone, but runs at 6 miles per hour when he is being dragged by his 100-pound German Shepherd dog. If John and his dog go on a run together for 30 minutes, and then John runs for an additional 30 minutes by himself, how far will John have traveled?

When John and his dog run together, they cover a distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour. Since they run together for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, the distance they cover together is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles} \]

After the dog runs for 30 minutes, John continues to run alone for 30 minutes at a speed of 4 miles per hour, covering:
\[ 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance John has covered is the sum of the distance covered with his dog and the distance he covers by himself:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 5 \text{ miles} \]

Let's break down John's run into two parts: the first part where he runs with his dog, and the second part where he runs alone.

First, we calculate how far John runs with his dog. Since they run together for 30 minutes, and dogs can run as fast as their owners, John's dog can run at 6 miles per hour. We convert 30 minutes to hours, which is 0.5 hours. The distance covered by John with his dog is:
\[ \text{Distance with dog} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far John runs by himself. After running with his dog, John runs for an additional 30 minutes (0.5 hours) by himself. At his normal speed of 4 miles per hour, the distance John runs alone is:
\[ \text{Distance alone} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances together gives us the total distance John runs:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance with dog} + \text{Distance alone} = 3 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 5 \text{ miles} \]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John travels, which includes both the time he runs with his dog and the time he runs alone.

First, let's find out how far John runs with his dog. Since they run for 30 minutes together, and John's speed is 6 miles per hour when he is being dragged by his dog, we need to convert 30 minutes to hours:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now we can calculate the distance John runs with his dog:
\[ \text{Distance with dog} = \text{Speed with dog} \times \text{Time with dog} \]
\[ \text{Distance with dog} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance with dog} = 3 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance John runs alone. The time he runs alone is 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours, and his speed is 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance alone} = \text{Speed alone} \times \text{Time alone} \]
\[ \text{Distance alone} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance alone} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance John travels:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance with dog} + \text{Distance alone} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 3 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 5 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, John will have traveled 5 miles.

To determine how far John has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers when he is being dragged by his dog and when he runs alone.

1. **Distance when John is being dragged by his dog:**
   - John's speed while being dragged by his dog is 6 miles per hour.
   - The time they run together is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
   - The distance covered while being dragged is given by the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \).
   - So, the distance \( D_{\text{dog}} \) is \( 6 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{miles} \).

2. **Distance when John runs alone:**
   - John runs alone at 4 miles per hour for an additional 30 minutes. Converting this time to hours gives 0.5 hours.
   - The distance \( D_{\text{alone}} \) is \( 4 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 2 \, \text{miles} \).

3. **Total distance:**
   - To find the total distance John has traveled, we add the distance covered when he is being dragged by his dog and the distance covered while running alone.
   - Total distance \( D_{\text{total}} \) is \( D_{\text{dog}} + D_{\text{alone}} = 3 \, \text{miles} + 2 \, \text{miles} = 5 \, \text{miles} \).

To find out how far John has traveled, we need to break down his run into two parts: the time spent with his dog and the time spent running alone.

First, John runs with his dog for 30 minutes. Since they run together at a speed of 6 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance they cover together during this time.

The formula for distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Since they run for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, the distance covered together is:
\[ \text{Distance with dog} = 6 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, John runs alone for 30 minutes. The speed at which he runs alone is 4 miles per hour, so the distance he covers in this time is:
\[ \text{Distance alone} = 4 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 2 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance John travels is the sum of the distances covered with his dog and alone:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 3 \, \text{miles} + 2 \, \text{miles} = 5 \, \text{miles} \]

First, we need to calculate the distance that John's dog travels together with him. Since John runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour, and they run for 30 minutes, we convert the time to hours: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours. The distance covered by the dog in this time is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{dog}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{dog}} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles} \]

The next part of the trip is when John runs alone. Since his speed is 4 miles per hour, and he runs for 30 minutes, we convert the time to hours: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours. The distance covered by John alone is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{John solo}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{John}} \times \text{Time} = 4 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances together gives us the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{dog}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{John solo}} = 3 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 5 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how far John has traveled during the total run, we need to break it down into two segments: the run with his dog and the run by himself. 

First, let's calculate the distance John travels with his dog. John runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour when being dragged by his dog. They run for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, we convert the time to hours, divide the distance by the speed, and multiply by 2 (since it runs for the same duration twice).

\[ \text{Distance with dog} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} \times \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}}\right) \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Next, John runs alone at 4 miles per hour. He runs for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. We calculate the distance as follows:

\[ \text{Distance alone} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} \times \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}}\right) = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances together gives us the total distance John has traveled:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 6 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

First, we calculate the distance John travels with his dog. His speed when running with the dog is 6 miles per hour, and the run lasts 30 minutes. We need to convert 30 minutes to hours (30/60 = 0.5 hours):

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance with dog = 6 mph × 0.5 hours = 3 miles

Next, we calculate the distance John travels by himself. His speed alone is 4 miles per hour, and the run lasts another 30 minutes (30/60 = 0.5 hours):

Distance by himself = 4 mph × 0.5 hours = 2 miles

Finally, to find the total distance John travels, we add the two distances together:

Total distance = Distance with dog + Distance by himself
Total distance = 3 miles + 2 miles = 5 miles

After the first run, John is left alone and runs for another 30 minutes. In this period, John runs at a speed of 4 miles per hour, so he can run \( 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

To find out how far John will have traveled, we need to compute the distance covered in both scenarios separately: one when he runs with the dog and another when he runs alone.

1. **Distance covered when running with the dog:**
   - Running speed with the dog: 6 mph
   - Time: 30 minutes 
   
   Convert time to hours: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
   
   Distance = Speed × Time = 6 mph × 0.5 hours = 3 miles

2. **Distance covered when running alone:**
   - Speed alone: 4 mph
   - Time: 30 minutes
   - Convert time to hours: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours

   Distance = Speed × Time = 4 mph × 0.5 hours = 2 miles

Total distance John will have traveled = Distance with dog + Distance alone = 3 miles + 2 miles = 5 miles

So, John will have traveled 5 miles.

To determine how far John will have traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers in each part of the run separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance John covers with his dog in 30 minutes. John's speed when running with the dog is 6 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance with dog} = \text{Speed with dog} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance John runs by himself in 30 minutes. His speed when running alone is 4 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance alone} = \text{Speed alone} \times \text{Time} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance John has traveled:
