#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Hayes does 3 loads of laundry a week. A full year has 52 weeks, so he will do \(3 \times 52 = 156\) loads of laundry in a year.

Each load uses a detergent pod, so he will need \(156\) detergent pods for a year.

The detergent pods come in packs of 39. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pods by the number of pods per pack:

\(156 \div 39 = 4\)

Therefore, Hayes will need 4 packs of detergent pods to do a full year of laundry.

Hayes does 3 loads of laundry each week. In a year (52 weeks), he will do \(3 \times 52 = 156\) loads of laundry.

Since he uses 1 pack of detergent pods for 3 loads, for 156 loads he will need \(156 \div 3 = 52\) packs of detergent pods.

Hayes does 3 loads of laundry a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he will do \(3 \times 52 = 156\) loads of laundry.

Each pack contains 39 detergent pods, so to find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of loads by the number of detergent pods per pack and round up if there's a remainder:

\(156 \div 39 = 4\), which means he needs 4 packs of detergent pods.

So, Hayes will need 4 packs of detergent pods to do a full year of laundry.

Hayes gets 3 loads of laundry a week which means he will get 3*52=156 loads in a year.
This is 156/3=52 pods of detergent.
So he will need 52/39=1. 32 packs of detergent, since you can't buy a fraction of a pack of detergent.

Hayes does 3 loads of laundry a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he will do 3 * 52 = 156 loads of laundry.

Each load uses one detergent pod, so for 156 loads, he will need 156 detergent pods.

If his detergent pods come 39 to a pack, then he will need 156 / 39 = 4 packs of detergent pods to do a full year of laundry.

Hayes does 3 loads of laundry a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he will do:
3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

Each detergent pod is used for 1 load of laundry, so he will need 156 detergent pods for a full year.

Each pack of detergent pods contains 39 pods, so to find out how many packs he will need, we divide the total number of pods needed by the number of pods per pack:

156 pods / 39 pods/pack = 4 packs

Therefore, Hayes will need 4 packs of detergent pods to do a full year of laundry.

#### GENERATION 8 RESPONSE ####


system
To find out how many packs of detergent pods Hayes will need for a full year, we need to first determine the total number of loads of laundry he will do in a year.

Hayes does 3 loads of laundry in a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we can calculate the total number of loads for a year as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 156 \text{ loads/year} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of detergent pods Hayes will need to do 156 loads, given that each pack contains 39 pods.

\[ \frac{156 \text{ loads}}{39 \text{ pods/pack}} = 4 \text{ packs} \]

So, Hayes will need 4 packs of detergent pods to do a full year of laundry.

First, let's determine the total number of loads of laundry Hayes does in a year. Since he does 3 loads of laundry a week, we multiply this by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52:

\[
3 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 156 \text{ loads/year}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of detergent pods he requires. Since each pack contains 39 detergent pods, we divide the total number of loads by the number of pods per pack:

\[
\frac{156 \text{ loads}}{39 \text{ pods/pack}} = 4 \text{ packs}
\]

Therefore, Hayes will need 4 packs of detergent pods to do a full year of laundry.
