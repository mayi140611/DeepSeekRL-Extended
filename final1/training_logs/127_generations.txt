system
The first cat meows 3 times per minute.
The second cat meows twice as frequently as the first cat, so it meows 2 * 3 = 6 times per minute.
The third cat meows at one-third the frequency of the second cat, so it meows 6 / 3 = 2 times per minute.

In 5 minutes, the first cat meows 3 * 5 = 15 times.
The second cat meows 6 * 5 = 30 times.
The third cat meows 2 * 5 = 10 times.

The combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes is 15 + 30 + 10 = 55.
