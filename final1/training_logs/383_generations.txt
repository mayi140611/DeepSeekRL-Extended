Anna gives away \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the cupcakes, so she gives away \( 60 \times \frac{4}{5} = 48 \) cupcakes. This leaves her with \( 60 - 48 = 12 \) cupcakes. She then eats 3 of these remaining cupcakes, leaving her with \( 12 - 3 = 9 \) cupcakes.

First, calculate how many cupcakes Anna gives away:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \]

Next, find out how many cupcakes she has after giving some away:
\[ 60 - 48 = 12 \]

Then, subtract the 3 cupcakes she eats:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]

Therefore, Anna has 9 cupcakes left.

Anna initially has 60 cupcakes. She gives away \(\frac{4}{5}\) of them to her classmates, which means she gives away:
\[
60 \times \frac{4}{5} = 60 \times 0.8 = 48
\]
So she has \(60 - 48 = 12\) cupcakes left.

Of these remaining 12 cupcakes, she eats 3, so the number of cupcakes she has left is:
\[
12 - 3 = 9
\]

Therefore, Anna has 9 cupcakes left.

Anna gives away \(4/5\) of the cupcakes, which means she gives away \(4/5 \times 60 = 48\) cupcakes. This leaves her with \(60 - 48 = 12\) cupcakes.

Then, she eats 3 of the remaining 1/5, which is \(1/5 \times 12 = 2.4\), but since the problem deals with whole cupcakes, she eats 3 cupcakes instead of 3.4, and the remaining cupcakes are \(12 - 3 = 9\).

So, Anna has 9 cupcakes left.

Anna gives away \(4/5\) of the cupcakes, so she gives away \(60 \times \frac{4}{5} = 48\) cupcakes. This leaves her with \(60 - 48 = 12\) cupcakes.

She then eats \(1/5\) of the remaining cupcakes, so she eats \(12 \times \frac{1}{5} = 2.4\) cupcakes, but since the number of cupcakes can't be a fraction, we assume she eats 2 cupcakes.

Therefore, she has \(12 - 2 = 10\) cupcakes left.

Of the remaining cupcakes, she eats \( \frac{1}{5} \), which means she eats \( 12 \times \frac{1}{5} = 2.4 \) cupcakes. Since she can't eat a fraction of a cupcake, she eats 2 cupcakes (assuming she eats only whole cupcakes).

The number of cupcakes left after she eats 2 cupcakes is \( 12 - 2 = 10 \).

To determine how many cupcakes Anna has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cupcakes Anna gives away.
2. Determine how many cupcakes are left after giving some away.
3. Subtract the number of cupcakes Anna eats from the remaining cupcakes.

First, Anna gives away \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the 60 cupcakes:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = \frac{4 \times 60}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48
\]
So, Anna gives away 48 cupcakes.

Next, we find out how many cupcakes are left after she gives away 48 cupcakes:
\[
60 - 48 = 12
\]
So, Anna has 12 cupcakes left after giving some away.

Then, Anna eats 3 of the remaining cupcakes:
\[
12 - 3 = 9
\]
So, Anna has 9 cupcakes left.

Therefore, the number of cupcakes Anna has left is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
