Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts. She spends half of this amount on jeans, which is $40 / 2 = $20. She spends twice this amount on coats, which is $40 * 2 = $80. Thus, Lisa spends a total of $40 + $20 + $80 = $140.

Carly spends a quarter as much as Lisa on t-shirts, which is $40 / 4 = $10. She spends 3 times as much on jeans, which is $20 * 3 = $60. She spends a quarter of the amount Lisa spent on coats, which is $80 / 4 = $20. Thus, Carly spends a total of $10 + $60 + $20 = $90.

In total, Lisa and Carly spend $140 + $90 = $230.

Reasoning
Let's break down the spending for Lisa and Carly step by step:

1. **Lisa's Spending:**
   - T-shirts: $40
   - Jeans: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = $20 \)
   - Coats: \( 2 \times 40 = $80 \)

2. **Carly's Spending:**
   - T-shirts: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = $10 \)
   - Jeans: \( 3 \times 20 = $60 \)
   - Coats: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = $20 \)

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent by Lisa and Carly by summing up their individual expenditures.

**Total spending by Lisa:**
\[ $40 + $20 + $80 = $140 \]

**Total spending by Carly:**
\[ $10 + $60 + $20 = $90 \]

**Total combined spending:**
\[ $140 + $90 = $230 \]

**Answer**

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total spending by Lisa:} & \quad $140 \\
\text{Total spending by Carly:} & \quad $90 \\
\hline
\text{Total combined spending:} & \quad $230
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the total amount spent by Lisa and Carly is $230.
