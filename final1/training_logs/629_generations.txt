system
Let's denote the cost of one deck of basketball cards as \( x \).

Mary bought:
- Two pairs of sunglasses for $50 each, which totals to \( 2 \times 50 = \$100 \)
- A pair of jeans for $100

So, the total amount Mary spent is \( \$100 + \$100 = \$200 \).

Rose bought:
- A pair of shoes for $150
- Two decks of basketball cards for \( 2x \) dollars

So, the total amount Rose spent is \( \$150 + 2x \).

Since Mary and Rose spent the same amount, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 200 = 150 + 2x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation:
\[ 200 = 150 + 2x \]
\[ 200 - 150 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the cost of one deck of basketball cards is \( \$25 \).

Let's calculate the total amount Mary spent first. Mary bought two pairs of sunglasses for $50 each and a pair of jeans for $100. So, the total cost for Mary is:

\(2 \times 50 + 100 = 100 + 100 = 200\)

Since Mary and Rose spent the same amount and Mary spent $200, Rose also spent $200. Rose bought a pair of shoes for $150 and two decks of basketball cards. Let the cost of one deck of basketball cards be \(x\). So, the equation for Rose's total spending is:

\(150 + 2x = 200\)

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\(2x = 200 - 150\)

\(2x = 50\)

\(x = 25\)

So, one deck of basketball cards cost $25.

Let's calculate the total amount Mary spent:
- Two pairs of sunglasses: $50 each, so $50 * 2 = $100
- A pair of jeans: $100
Total spent by Mary = $100 + $100 = $200

Now, let's calculate the total amount Rose spent:
- A pair of shoes: $150
- Two decks of basketball cards

Let's denote the cost of one deck of basketball cards as \( x \). Therefore, the total cost for two decks is \( 2x \).

The total amount spent by Rose is $200 (the same as Mary) plus the cost of the two decks of basketball cards, so:

\[ 150 + 2x = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 200 - 150 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( x \):

\[ x = 50 / 2 \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, one deck of basketball cards cost $25.

Let's calculate the total amount Mary spent:

- Mary bought two pairs of sunglasses for $50 each, so that's \(2 \times 50 = 100\) dollars.
- Mary also bought a pair of jeans for $100.

So, the total amount Mary spent is \(100 + 100 = 200\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Rose spent:

- Rose bought a pair of shoes for $150.
- Rose also bought two decks of basketball cards for a total of \(2 \times \text{one deck of basketball cards costs}\).

Let the cost of one deck of basketball cards be \(x\). So, the total amount Rose spent is \(150 + 2x\).

Since Mary and Rose spent the same amount, we can set up the following equation:

\[150 + 2x = 200\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[2x = 200 - 150\]
\[2x = 50\]
\[x = 25\]

So, one deck of basketball cards cost $25.

To determine the cost of one deck of basketball cards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Mary spent.
2. Determine the total amount Rose spent.
3. Subtract the cost of the two pairs of sunglasses and the pair of jeans from the total amount Rose spent to find the cost of the two decks of basketball cards.
4. Divide the cost of the two decks of basketball cards by 2 to find the cost of one deck.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Mary spent.
Mary bought two pairs of sunglasses for $50 each and a pair of jeans for $100.
\[ \text{Total spent by Mary} = 2 \times 50 + 100 = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount Rose spent.
We know that both Mary and Rose spent the same amount, which is $200.

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the two pairs of sunglasses and the pair of jeans from the total amount Rose spent.
\[ \text{Cost of two decks of basketball cards} = 200 - 2 \times 50 - 100 \]
\[ \text{Cost of two decks of basketball cards} = 200 - 100 - 100 = 0 \]

Since Rose spent $200 and her total is composed of the two decks of basketball cards, the cost of one deck of basketball cards is:
\[ \text{Cost of one deck of basketball cards} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \]

Therefore, the cost of one deck of basketball cards is $100.

Let's break down the costs for Mary first:
- Mary bought two pairs of sunglasses: \(2 \times \$50 = \$100\)
- Mary also bought a pair of jeans: \( \$100\)
- The total amount spent by Mary is \( \$100 + \$100 = \$200 \).

Now, let's look at Rose's purchases:
- Rose bought a pair of shoes: \( \$150\)
- Rose also bought two decks of basketball cards: \(2 \times \text{cost of one deck}\)

Since Mary and Rose spent the same amount, their total expenses must be equal. So:
- Total amount spent by Rose = \$150 (for shoes) + 2 \times \text{cost of one deck} = \$200 (same amount as Mary)

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 150 + 2 \times \text{cost of one deck} = 200 \]

To find the cost of one deck of basketball cards:
\[ 2 \times \text{cost of one deck} = 200 - 150 \]
\[ 2 \times \text{cost of one deck} = 50 \]
\[ \text{cost of one deck} = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ \text{cost of one deck} = 25 \]

So, the cost of one deck of basketball cards was \$25.

Let's determine the cost of the pair of basketball cards. First, calculate the total cost of sunglasses that Mary bought.

Total cost of two pairs of sunglasses = 2 * $50 = $100

Now, add the cost of jeans to find the total amount that Mary spent:

Total amount spent by Mary = $100 (sunglasses) + $100 (jeans) = $200

Since Mary and Rose spent the same amount, we know that Rose spent $200 as well. Now, let's subtract the cost of shoes from Rose's total expenditure to find the cost of the two decks of basketball cards:

Amount left for basketball cards = $200 (total amount spent by Rose) - $150 (cost of shoes) = $50

Now we can find the cost of one deck of basketball cards by dividing this amount by 2:

Cost of one deck of basketball cards = $50 / 2 = $25

So, one deck of basketball cards cost $25.

To determine the cost of one deck of basketball cards, we first need to understand how much Mary spent in total. Mary bought two pairs of sunglasses for $50 each, and a pair of jeans for $100. The total cost for Mary is calculated as follows:

\[ 2 \times 50 + 100 = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

So, Mary spent $200 in total.

Next, we know that Mary and Rose spent the same amount, which was $200. Rose bought a pair of shoes for $150 and two decks of basketball cards. Let's denote the cost of one deck of basketball cards as \( x \). The total cost for Rose is then:

\[ 150 + 2x = 200 \]

We can solve this equation to find the value of \( x \):

\[ 2x = 200 - 150 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]
