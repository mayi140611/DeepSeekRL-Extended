system
To determine how many cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we can calculate the total number of students across all the classes. 

There are 3 fourth-grade classes, each with 30 students. So, for the fourth-grade classes, the total number of students is:
\[ 3 \text{ classes} \times 30 \text{ students/class} = 90 \text{ students} \]

Additionally, there's a P.E. class with 50 students.

Now, we add the number of students from the fourth-grade classes and the P.E. class:
\[ 90 \text{ students} + 50 \text{ students} = 140 \text{ students} \]

Jessa needs to make a cupcake for each of these 140 students. Therefore, she needs to make:
\[ \boxed{140} \text{ cupcakes} \]

To determine the total number of cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes required for each group and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the number of cupcakes needed for the fourth-grade classes:
   - There are 3 fourth-grade classes.
   - Each class has 30 students.
   - Therefore, the total number of cupcakes for the fourth-grade classes is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).

2. Calculate the number of cupcakes needed for the P.E. class:
   - The P.E. class has 50 students.
   - Therefore, the number of cupcakes needed for the P.E. class is 50.

3. Sum the cupcakes for all the groups:
   - Total cupcakes = cupcakes for fourth-grade classes + cupcakes for P.E. class
   - Total cupcakes = 90 + 50 = 140.

Thus, Jessa needs to make 140 cupcakes.

To calculate the total number of cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we first need to determine the number of students in these classes:

- Each fourth-grade class has 30 students, so for 3 fourth-grade classes, the total number of students is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
- She also needs to make cupcakes for a P.E. class with 50 students.

Adding these together, the total number of students and cupcakes needed is:
\[90 (from fourth-grade classes) + 50 (PE students) = 140 cupcakes.\]

So, Jessa needs to make 140 cupcakes.

To find out how many cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we can multiply the number of students in each class by the total number of classes.

First, let's calculate the total number of students in the third-grade classes:
3 classes * 30 students/class = 90 students

Next, we add the number of students in the P.E. class:
90 students + 50 students = 140 students

Now, we can calculate the total number of cupcakes Jessa needs to make:
140 students * 1 cupcake/student = 140 cupcakes

So, Jessa needs to make 140 cupcakes.

To find out how many cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of students in the fourth-grade classes and the P.E. class combined.

Each fourth-grade class has 30 students, and there are 3 such classes:
\[ 30 \text{ students/class} \times 3 \text{ classes} = 90 \text{ students} \]

The P.E. class has 50 students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \]

Adding the students from the fourth-grade classes and the P.E. class together gives:
\[ 90 \text{ students} + 50 \text{ students} = 140 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Jessa needs to make 140 cupcakes.

To find out how many cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of students in the three fourth-grade classes.

\[ \text{Number of students in one fourth-grade class} = 30 \]
\[ \text{Total number of students in three fourth-grade classes} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, we add the number of students in the P.E. class:

\[ \text{Number of students in P.E. class} = 50 \]

Now, we add the total number of students in the fourth-grade classes and the P.E. class:

\[ \text{Total number of cupcakes} = 90 + 50 = 140 \]

Therefore, Jessa needs to make 140 cupcakes.

Let's calculate the total number of cupcakes needed:

1. Each fourth-grade class has 30 students, and there are 3 classes, so that's 30 * 3 = 90 students from the fourth-grade classes.
2. The P.E. class has 50 students.
3. Total students = 90 (fourth-grade students) + 50 (P.E. class students) = 140 students.

Now, we need to determine if Jessa knows how many cupcakes she will make per student or if there's a specific method to calculate it. Without this information, we cannot determine the total number of cupcakes needed to feed all the students. Let's assume we need to distribute these cupcakes equally among all students.

4. Total cupcakes needed = 140 (total students) * C (cupcakes per student), where C is the number of cupcakes per student that will be determined.
5. However, since we don't know C, we cannot determine the total number of cupcakes needed beyond 140 * C.

Since we don't have a specific value for 'C', we can't give a number for the total cupcakes needed without knowing how many cupcakes are required per student.

To determine the total number of cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes required for each group of students and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of cupcakes needed for the fourth-grade classes:

Next, we calculate the number of cupcakes needed for the P.E. class:
\[
1 \text{ P.E. class} \times 50 \text{ students} = 50 \text{ cupcakes}
