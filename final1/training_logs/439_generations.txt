system
Let \( C \) be Cori's current age and \( A \) be her aunt's current age. According to the problem:
- Cori is 3 years old today, so \( C = 3 \).
- In 5 years, Cori will be \( C + 5 \) and her aunt will be \( A + 5 \).
- In 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt, so we write this as:
  \[
  C + 5 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5)
  \]
  
Substitute \( C = 3 \) into the equation:
\[
3 + 5 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5)
\]
\[
8 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5)
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
8 \cdot 3 = A + 5
\]
\[
24 = A + 5
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[
24 - 5 = A
\]
\[
A = 19
\]

Thus, Cori's aunt is currently 19 years old.

If Cori is 3 years old today, in 5 years she will be 3 + 5 = 8 years old.
Let x be Aunt Mary's age today. In 5 years, Aunt Mary will be x + 5 years old.
8 = 1/3(x + 5) 3 * 8 = x + 5 24 = x + 5 x = 24 - 5 x = 19

Therefore, Aunt Mary is 19 years old today.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote Cori's current age as \( C \), her aunt's current age as \( A \), and the age difference between them as \( D \). We know from the problem:

1. \( C = 3 \) (Cori is 3 years old today)
2. In 5 years, Cori will be \( C + 5 \) years old, and her aunt will be \( A + 5 \) years old.
3. At that time, Cori's age will be one-third of her aunt's age: \( C + 5 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5) \).

We can substitute \( C = 3 \) into the equation:

\[ 3 + 5 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5) \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 8 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:

\[ 24 = A + 5 \]

Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 24 - 5 \]
\[ A = 19 \]

So, Cori's aunt is 19 years old today.

Let's denote Cori's current age as \( C \) and her aunt's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \) years old today.

In 5 years, Cori's age will be \( C + 5 \) and her aunt's age will be \( A + 5 \).

The problem states that in 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt. This can be written as:
\[ C + 5 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5) \]

Now, substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation:
\[ 3 + 5 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5) \]
\[ 8 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5) \]

To solve for \( A \), multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 8 \times 3 = A + 5 \]
\[ 24 = A + 5 \]

Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( A \):
\[ 24 - 5 = A \]
\[ 19 = A \]

So, Cori's aunt is currently 19 years old.

Let's denote Cori's age in 5 years as \( C + 5 \) and her aunt's age in 5 years as \( A + 5 \). According to the problem, in 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt. This can be expressed with the equation:

\[ C + 5 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5) \]

Since Cori is 3 years old today, we can substitute \( C = 3 \) into the equation:

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Now, solve for \( A \) by subtracting 5 from both sides:

\[ A = 24 - 5 \]

system
Let's denote Cori's age today as \( C \) and her aunt's age today as \( A \).

Given that today Cori is 3 years old (\( C = 3 \)), we can represent her age in 5 years as \( C + 5 \).

The problem states that in 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt. So in 5 years, her aunt's age will be \( A + 5 \).

The relationship between their ages in 5 years can be written as:

\[ C + 5 = \frac{1}{3} (A + 5) \]

Substituting \( C = 3 \) into the equation:

\[ 3 + 5 = \frac{1}{3} (A + 5) \]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[ 8 = \frac{1}{3} (A + 5) \]

To solve for \( A \), we multiply both sides by 3:

\[ 24 = A + 5 \]

Then, subtracting 5 from both sides:

\[ A = 24 - 5 \]

\[ A = 19 \]

Therefore, Cori's aunt is 19 years old today.

In 5 years, Cori will be 3 + 5 = 8 years old.
Let's represent the age of Cori's aunt as A. So in 5 years, Cori's aunt will be A + 5 years old.
According to the problem, in 5 years, Cori (3 + 5 = 8 years old) will be one-third the age of her aunt (A + 5), so we can write the equation: 8 = 1/3 * (A + 5).
To solve for A, let's first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3: 3 * 8 = A + 5.
Simplifying the left side, we get: 24 = A + 5.
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we have: A = 24 - 5 = 19.

So, Cori's aunt is 19 years old today.

Let's denote Cori's current age as \( C \) and her aunt's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, Cori is 3 years old today, so \( C = 3 \).

In 5 years, Cori's age will be \( C + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \) years.

In 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt. So, in 5 years, her aunt will be twice Cori's age at that time, i.e., \( 2(C + 5) \).

At that same time, \( A = A + 5 \) (her aunt's current age).

So, we can set up the equation based on the information given:
\[ A + 5 = 2(3 + 5) \]
\[ A + 5 = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ A + 5 = 16 \]
\[ A = 16 - 5 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Therefore, Cori's aunt is 11 years old today.

Let's denote Cori's current age as \( C \) and her aunt's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, Cori is currently 3 years old, so \( C = 3 \).

In 5 years, Cori's age will be \( C + 5 \). The problem states that in 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt. Since her aunt will also be 5 years older than she is today, her aunt's age in 5 years will be \( A + 5 \).

Mathematically, we can express the relationship between Cori's and her aunt's ages in 5 years as:
\[ C + 5 = \frac{1}{3} (A + 5) \]

Since \( C = 3 \), we substitute 3 for \( C \):
\[ 3 + 5 = \frac{1}{3} (A + 5) \]
\[ 8 = \frac{1}{3} (A + 5) \]

To solve for \( A \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ 8 \times 3 = A + 5 \]
\[ 24 = A + 5 \]

Next, we subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ 24 - 5 = A \]

In 5 years, Cori will be 3 + 5 = 8 years old.
Let her age today be x. In 5 years, her age will be x + 5.
In 5 years, her age will be one-third the age of her aunt, so:
\[ x + 5 = \frac{1}{3} (x + 5 + 5) \]
\[ x + 5 = \frac{1}{3} (x + 10) \]
\[ 3(x + 5) = x + 10 \]
\[ 3x + 15 = x + 10 \]
\[ 2x = -5 \]
