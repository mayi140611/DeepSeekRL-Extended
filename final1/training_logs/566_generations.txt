###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles that she needed to sell at $2 each to get exactly enough money to buy her friend a birthday gift. However, at the store, Lilith realized she could not sell at $2 because the regular price was $1.85 per water bottle in her town, and she had to reduce her price to $1.85 as well to sell her water bottles. Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost.

Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles. Five dozen is equal to \(5 \times 12 = 60\) water bottles. She needs to sell each at $1.85.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Lilith will make from selling all her water bottles at the reduced price:
\[ 60 \text{ bottles} \times \$1.85 \text{ per bottle} = \$111 \]

Lilith needs \(\$111\) to buy her friend a birthday gift. She calculates the total amount of money she needs to find to buy the birthday gift:
\[ \$111 \]

To calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after reducing her price, we start by determining the total number of water bottles she originally planned to sell.

Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles:

\[ 5 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ bottles/dozen} = 60 \text{ bottles} \]

Each water bottle was originally priced at $2, so the total original earnings were:

\[ 60 \text{ bottles} \times \$2/\text{bottle} = \$120 \]

Now, she reduced the price to $1.85 per bottle and sold them. The total earnings from selling all 60 bottles at $1.85 each were:

\[ 60 \text{ bottles} \times \$1.85/\text{bottle} = \$111 \]

The adjusted price is $1.85, so the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift is:

\[ \$111 \]

To determine how much money Lilith will have after selling her water bottles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of water bottles Lilith originally had.
2. Determine the reduced price per water bottle.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the water bottles.
4. Calculate the remaining amount of money Lilith needs to find.

Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles. Since one dozen equals 12, she had:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ water bottles} \]

The reduced price per water bottle is $1.85. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the water bottles is:
\[ 60 \times 1.85 = 111 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the birthday gift is $180. Therefore, the amount of money Lilith still needs to find is:
\[ 180 - 111 = 69 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost is:
\[ 69 \text{ dollars} \]

To calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift, we need to determine how many water bottles she can sell at the reduced price and then calculate the total revenue from those sales.

First, let's find out how many water bottles one can sell at the reduced price. Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles, which means she had:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ water bottles} \]

Since she could not sell at $2, she had to reduce her price to $1.85. Therefore, the revenue from selling one water bottle is now $1.85.

Now, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling 60 water bottles at $1.85 each:
\[ 60 \times 1.85 = 111 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Lilith will have $111 after selling all her water bottles at the reduced cost. To buy her friend a birthday gift, she will need to find an additional amount. However, the question asks to calculate the total amount of money she will have to find after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost, which we have already calculated as $111.

Lilith originally planned to sell the water bottles at $2 each. Therefore, she would need to sell all 5 dozen water bottles at this price, which is 5 * 12 = 60 water bottles. At $2 per water bottle, she would make a total of 60 * $2 = $120.

Now, she needs to reduce the price to $1.85 per water bottle. If she sells all 60 water bottles at this reduced price, the total amount of money she would make is 60 * $1.85 = $111.

To calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift, we subtract the amount she will make from selling the water bottles from the price of the gift. The price of the gift is $120. So, the amount she will have to find is $120 - $111 = $9.

Lilith originally had 5 dozen water bottles, which is 5 * 12 = 60 water bottles.

Each water bottle was initially priced at $2.00, but she had to reduce the price to $1.85 each to sell them.

The total amount she would have earned from selling all water bottles at the reduced price is 60 * $1.85.

To find out how much money she will have to find to buy her friend's birthday gift, we need to subtract the total amount earned from the original price.

The original price for all water bottles is 60 * $2.00.

The difference is the amount of money Lilith needs to find, which is (60 * $2.00) - (60 * $1.85).

Let's calculate the difference:

$60 * $2.00 = $120.00
$60 * $1.85 = $111.00
Difference = $120.00 - $111.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Lilith will have to find $9.00 to buy her friend the birthday gift.

To determine how much money Lilith will have after reducing the price and selling all her water bottles, we first need to calculate the total revenue Lilith makes by selling all the bottles at $1.85 each.

Since Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles, and one dozen equals 12 bottles, she had:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ water bottles} \]

At the regular price of $1.85 per bottle, the total revenue (R) is given by:

\[ R = 60 \times 1.85 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 60 \times 1.85 = 111 \]

So, the total revenue that Lilith makes is $111.

Finally, to find out how much money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift, we need to subtract the total revenue from the price of the gift. According to the given information, the gift costs $200.

Let \( G \) be the cost of the gift, and \( R \) be the revenue from selling the water bottles.

\[ G - R = 200 - 111 \]
\[ G - 111 = 89 \]

Thus, Lilith will have to find $89 to buy her friend the birthday gift.

First, we calculate the total number of water bottles Lilith needs to sell:

Since the price per bottle is $1.85, we multiply the number of bottles by the price per bottle to find the total revenue:

To calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find, we first need to determine how many water bottles she can sell at the reduced price.

Original price per bottle = $2.00
Reduced price per bottle = $1.85

Number of bottles available = 5 dozen
Number of bottles available = 5 x 12 = 60 bottles

Number of bottles sold at reduced price = 60

Earnings from selling at reduced price = 60 bottles x $1.85 per bottle = $111.00

To buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith needs exactly $111.00. Since she has already earned $111.00 from selling the water bottles at the reduced price, the total amount of money she needs to find is:

Amount needed = $111.00
Amount found = $111.00

Therefore, Lilith will not need to find any additional money to buy her friend the birthday gift.

To calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost, we need to first determine how many water bottles she can sell at the reduced price.

Originally, she had five dozen water bottles, which is equal to 5 * 12 = 60 water bottles. At the reduced price, she can only sell 60 / $1.85 = 32 water bottles (since she cannot sell a fraction of a water bottle).

Each water bottle is sold for $1.85, so the total amount of money she will get from selling the water bottles is 32 * $1.85 = $59.20.

Lilith's friend's birthday gift costs the same amount, so she needs $59.20 to buy the gift.
