#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Ken initially had 50 pencils. He gave 10 pencils to Manny. He then gave Nilo 10 more pencils than he gave to Manny, which is 10 + 10 = 20 pencils.

So, the total number of pencils given away is:
Manny's pencils + Nilo's pencils = 10 + 20 = 30 pencils.

Ken kept the rest of the pencils, which is:
50 (initial) - 30 (given away) = 20 pencils.

Ken initially had 50 pencils.

He gave Manny 10 pencils.

He gave Nilo 10 more pencils than he gave to Manny, which is \(10 + 10 = 20\) pencils.

So, the total number of pencils given away is \(10 + 20 = 30\) pencils.

The number of pencils Ken kept is \(50 - 30 = 20\) pencils.

system
First, let's calculate the total number of pencils given to Manny. Ken gave 10 pencils to Manny.
Next, Ken gave \(10 + 10 = 20\) pencils to Nilo.
Now, let's add the pencils given to Manny and Nilo to find the total number of pencils they received: \(10 + 20 = 30\).
Finally, subtract the total number of pencils given from the initial amount Ken had: \(50 - 30 = 20\).
Ken kept 20 pencils.
