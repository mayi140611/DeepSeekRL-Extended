#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
To calculate Arlene's average hiking pace, we need to divide the total distance she hiked by the total time she spent hiking.

Total distance hiked = 24 miles
Total time spent hiking = 6 hours

Average pace = Total distance / Total time

Let's calculate this:

Average pace = 24 miles / 6 hours = 4 miles per hour

Therefore, Arlene's average hiking pace was 4 miles per hour.

To find Arlene's average hiking pace in miles per hour, we need to divide the total miles she hiked by the total time she spent hiking.

Total miles hiked = 24 miles
Total time spent hiking = 6 hours

Arlene's average hiking pace in miles per hour = Total miles hiked / Total time spent hiking

Arlene's average hiking pace in miles per hour = 24 miles / 6 hours = 4 miles per hour

The temperature during the day is 60 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not needed to calculate Arlene's hiking pace.

system
To determine Arlene's average hiking pace in miles per hour, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Average Pace} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

Given:
- Total Distance = 24 miles
- Total Time = 6 hours

Now we can plug in these values to calculate the average pace:

\[
\text{Average Pace} = \frac{24 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

So, Arlene's average hiking pace was 4 miles per hour.
