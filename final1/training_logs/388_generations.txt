#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
The total monthly income from subletting is \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) dollars.
The total monthly rent he pays for the apartment is $900.
So, his profit per month is \(1200 - 900 = 300\) dollars.
In a year, his profit is \(300 \times 12 = 3600\) dollars.

To determine John's annual profit, we need to calculate both his total revenue and total expenses for the year.

First, calculate the total monthly revenue:
John sublets to 3 people, and each pays $400 per month.
\[
3 \times 400 = 1200
\]
So, John's total monthly revenue is $1200.

Next, calculate the total monthly expenses:
John rents the apartment for $900 per month.
\[
900
\]
So, John's total monthly expenses are $900.

Now, calculate the total annual revenue:
\[
1200 \times 12 = 14400
\]
So, John's total annual revenue is $14400.

Calculate the total annual expenses:
\[
900 \times 12 = 10800
\]
So, John's total annual expenses are $10800.

Finally, calculate the annual profit:
\[
14400 - 10800 = 3600
\]

Therefore, John makes a profit of $3600 in a year.

To calculate John's annual profit, we need to first calculate his annual income from subletting and then subtract his annual rent for the apartment.

1. Calculate John's monthly income from subletting:
   Each person pays $400 per month. Since there are 3 people:
   \( 3 \times 400 = 1200 \) dollars per month.

2. Calculate John's annual income from subletting:
   \( 1200 \times 12 = 14400 \) dollars per year.

3. Calculate John's annual rent for the apartment:
   \( 900 \times 12 = 10800 \) dollars per year.

4. Calculate John's annual profit:
   \( 14400 - 10800 = 3600 \) dollars per year.

Therefore, the calculations show that John has a profit of $3600 per year from subletting his apartment.

The total monthly income from subletting is \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) dollars. The monthly profit is the total monthly income minus the rent, which is \(1200 - 900 = 300\) dollars. The yearly profit is \(300 \times 12 = 3600\) dollars.

To calculate John's yearly profit from subletting his apartment, let's first determine the total monthly income from subletting.

Since each of the three sublet recipients pays $400 per month, the total monthly income from subletting is:
\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars per month} \]

This is his monthly profit. To find his yearly profit, we multiply his monthly profit by 12:
\[ 1200 \times 12 = 14400 \text{ dollars per year} \]

John also has a monthly rental expense of $900. So, his total monthly expenditure is:
\[ 900 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, to find his yearly expenditure, we multiply his monthly expenditure by 12:
\[ 900 \times 12 = 10800 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Finally, to get the yearly profit after subtracting his yearly expenditure from his yearly income from subletting, we do:
\[ 14400 - 10800 = 3600 \text{ dollars per year} \]

So, John makes a profit of $3600 per year.

The total amount paid by the sublets in a month is $400 * 3 = $1200. In a year, this amount is $1200 * 12 = $14400. Subtracting the monthly rent he pays of $900 gives a yearly profit of $14400 - $900 * 12 = $4800.

Total income from subletting is calculated by multiplying the number of tenants by the amount each pays. So, \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) dollars per month.

Total monthly income from subletting = \(1200\) dollars.

Now, subtract the monthly rent John pays to get the monthly profit.

Monthly profit = \(1200 - 900 = 300\) dollars per month.

To find the annual profit, multiply the monthly profit by 12.

Annual profit = \(300 \times 12 = 3600\) dollars.

To determine John's annual profit, we first calculate his monthly revenue and expenses.

Monthly revenue = Number of tenants * Monthly rent per tenant
Monthly revenue = 3 * $400 = $1200

Monthly expenses = Fixed rent
Monthly expenses = $900

Profit per month = Monthly revenue - Monthly expenses
Profit per month = $1200 - $900 = $300

To find the annual profit, we multiply the monthly profit by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Annual profit = Profit per month * 12
Annual profit = $300 * 12 = $3600

To calculate John's annual profit, we need to consider his monthly expenditure on rent and the total monthly income from subletting the apartment.

1. Calculate the total monthly income from subletting: \(3 \text{ people} \times \$400/\text{person} = \$1200\).
2. John's monthly rent: \( \$900\).
3. Monthly profit: \( \$1200 - \$900 = \$300\).

Thus, John makes a profit of \$300 each month.

To find out his annual profit, we multiply his monthly profit by the number of months in a year:

\( \$300 \times 12 \text{ months} = \$3600\).

So, John makes a profit of \$3600 per year.

To calculate the profit John makes in a year, we need to determine his total income and total expenses.

John sublets the apartment to 3 people, with each paying $400 per month. Therefore, his total monthly income from the sublet is:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times \$400 \text{ per person per month} = \$1200 \text{ per month} \]

His monthly expenses for the apartment rental are:
\[ \$900 \text{ per month} \]

The profit from the sublet is then:
\[ \$1200 \text{ per month} - \$900 \text{ per month} = \$300 \text{ per month} \]

To find the profit for a year, we multiply the monthly profit by 12:
\[ \$300 \text{ per month} \times 12 \text{ months per year} = \$3600 \text{ per year} \]

John makes 3*400=$1200 per month from the 3 people who rent from him.
So he makes 1200*3=$3600 per month from the sublets.
So he makes 3600*12=$43,200 in a year from the sublets.

He also pays 900*12=$10,800 for the apartment.

So his profit is 43200-10800=$3240.
