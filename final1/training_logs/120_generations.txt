system
To calculate how much money Carrie will have left after buying the bike, we need to calculate her monthly income and then subtract the cost of the bike from it.

First, let's calculate her monthly income:
- Carrie earns $8 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- It's a month, which typically consists of about 4 weeks.

Monthly income = Hourly wage * Hours per week * Weeks in a month
Monthly income = $8 * 35 * 4
Monthly income = $1,120

Next, we subtract the cost of the bike from her monthly income:
Cost of bike = $400
Money left after buying the bike = Monthly income - Cost of bike
Money left after buying the bike = $1,120 - $400
Money left after buying the bike = $720

Therefore, after buying her bike, Carrie will have $720 left over.

Carrie earns $8/hour * 35 hours/week = $280/week. She works for 4 weeks in a month, so she makes $280/week * 4 weeks/month = $1120/month. If she wants to buy a bike, she'll spend $400 on it, leaving her with $1120 - $400 = $720.

To determine how much money Carrie will have left over after buying her bike, we first need to calculate her weekly earnings.

Carrie earns $8 per hour and works 35 hours a week. We can calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works:

\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \$8 \text{ per hour} \times 35 \text{ hours per week} = \$280 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the entire month. Assuming there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the month:

\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = \$280 \text{ per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$1120 \]

Carrie has saved all of her money, which is $1120. She wants to buy a bike that costs $400. To find out how much money she will have left after buying the bike, we subtract the cost of the bike from her total savings:

\[ \text{Amount Left} = \$1120 \text{ (total savings)} - \$400 \text{ (cost of the bike)} = \$720 \]

Therefore:

To determine how much money Carrie will have left after buying the bike, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of hours Carrie has worked in a month.
2. Calculate Carrie's total earnings in a month.
3. Subtract the cost of the bike from her total earnings to find out how much money she will have left over.

Step 1: Calculate the number of hours Carrie has worked in a month.
Since Carrie works 35 hours a week, we can calculate the number of hours she has worked in a month by multiplying this weekly amount by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 140 \text{ hours/month} \]

Step 2: Calculate Carrie's total earnings in a month.
Since Carrie earns $8 per hour, we can calculate her total earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she has worked in a month:
\[ 8 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 140 \text{ hours/month} = 1120 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the bike from her total earnings to find out how much money she will have left over.
The cost of the bike is $400. Therefore, we subtract the cost of the bike from her total earnings:
\[ 1120 \text{ dollars} - 400 \text{ dollars} = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, after buying the bike, Carrie will have $720 left over.

First, we calculate how much money Carrie earns in a week. She works 35 hours a week at $8 per hour. The weekly earnings are \( 35 \times 8 = 280 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate her total earnings in a month. Since there are typically 4 weeks in a month, her monthly earnings are \( 280 \times 4 = 1120 \) dollars.

Carrie wants to buy a bike for $400. To find out how much money she will have left after buying the bike, we subtract the cost of the bike from her total earnings. The remaining amount is \( 1120 - 400 = 720 \) dollars.

Carrie earns $8/hour * 35 hours/week = $280/week. If she has been working for a month and is expected to save all her money, she would have earned $280/month. Carrie's total savings after buying her bike would be $400 - ($280/month).
