#### GENERATION 2 RESPONSE ####


system
First, we need to determine how many cones Dan sold. Since each cone costs $2, we can divide the total revenue by the cost per cone to find the number of cones sold:

\[ \text{Number of cones sold} = \frac{\text{Total revenue}}{\text{Cost per cone}} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Since every sixth customer gets a free cone, we need to find out how many customers received a free cone. This can be calculated by dividing the number of cones sold by 6:

\[ \text{Number of free cones} = \frac{\text{Number of cones sold}}{6} = \frac{50}{6} = 8.\overline{3} \]

Since Dan cannot give away a fraction of a cone for free, we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[ \text{Number of free cones} = \lfloor 8.\overline{3} \rfloor = 8 \]

Dan earns a profit from each cone, so he can only afford to give away cones if the total cost of cones he sells is less than or equal to $100.

Let's start by finding out how many cones Dan sold. If each cone costs $2, and he sold $100 worth of cones, then he sold $100 / $2 = 50 cones.

Since every sixth customer gets a free cone, for every 6 cones sold, 1 is free. Therefore, the number of free cones given is 50 / 6, which gives us 8 full sets of 6 cones plus 2 extra cones. This means he gave away 8 free cones.

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####

system
Let's denote the number of customers who bought cones as \( x \). Since every sixth customer gets a free cone, the number of free cones given away would be \( \frac{x}{6} \). Each cone cost $2, so the total revenue from cones sold is 100, which gives us the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \) gives us:
\[ x = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Since every sixth customer gets a free cone, the number of free cones given away is \( \frac{x}{6} \):
\[ \frac{50}{6} = \frac{25}{3} \]

So, Dan gave away 8 free cones (after rounding down).

#### GENERATION 5 RESPONSE ####

To determine how many free ice cream cones Dan gave away, we first need to understand how many cones were sold. The cost of $100 worth of cones means Dan sold these cones at $2 each, so he sold \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) cones.

Since every sixth customer gets a free cone, we can determine the number of free cones given away by the following reasoning:
1. First, identify the total number of cones sold: 50 cones.
2. Since every sixth customer gets a free cone, the number of free cones is the ceiling of the division of the total number of cones sold by 6 (because if one more customer were to arrive, they would also get a free cone).
3. Using the ceiling function, the number of free cones is \( \left\lceil \frac{50}{6} \right\rceil = 9 \).

Therefore, the number of free cones given away is 9.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####


system
To determine how many free ice cream cones Dan gave away, we need to understand the pricing of the ice cream cones and the conditions for free ones. Dan sells each cone for $2, so if he received $100 in sales, we can calculate how many cones he sold by dividing the total sales by the price of each cone.
$100 / $2 = 50 cones sold

Now we know that Dan sells 50 cones and every sixth cone is free. This means that out of the 50 cones sold, 50/6 = 8...5 (since dividing 50 by 6 does not result in a whole number)
Thus, we can say that 8 cones are sold for money and 8 free cones.

Let's denote the number of free cones as \(F\). Each paid-cone costs $2, and he sold $100 worth of cones, meaning he sold 50 cones (since \(50 \times 2 = 100\)).

For every sixth paid cone, there is one free cone. Since he sold 50 cones, the number of free cones given away is the integer part of \( \frac{50}{6} \).

Let's calculate \( \frac{50}{6} \) and find the integer part.

Let's reason through this step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how many cones Dan sold for $100.
2. Since each cone costs $2, we can divide the total sales by the price of one cone to find out how many cones were sold.
3. $100 ÷ $2 = 50 cones sold.

Now, let's consider the free cones:

1. We know that every 6th customer gets a free cone. To find how many free cones were given away, we simply divide the number of cones sold by 6.
2. 50 ÷ 6 = 8 remainder 2.

This means that 8 full sets of every 6th customer were given a free cone, and 2 customers received a free cone on top of that.

So, based on our reasoning, Dan gave away 8 free cones.

To find out how many free cones Dan gave away, we need to divide the total revenue by the price of each cone and then take the integer part of the result since the cones are given to every sixth customer. 

Total revenue: $100
Price per cone: $2

Number of cones sold = Total revenue / Price per cone = $100 / $2 = 50 cones

Since every sixth customer gets a free cone, we can find the number of free cones by dividing the number of cones sold by 6:

Number of free cones = Total cones sold / Every sixth customer = 50 cones / 6

50 / 6 = 8.333...

Since we can't give away a fraction of a cone, we take the integer part of the result:

Number of free cones = 8

To determine how many free cones Dan gave away, we need to calculate the number of cones sold by the total number of customers.

Let's start with the given information:
- Cones cost $2 each.
- Dan sells $100 worth of cones.

First, calculate the number of cones sold:
\[
\text{Number of cones sold} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per cone}} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
\]

Next, we need to find out how many customers could have purchased cones:
\[
\text{Total number of customers} = \frac{\text{Total number of cones sold}}{1} = 50
\]

Since every sixth customer gets a free cone, we can determine the number of customers who received free cones by dividing the total number of customers by 6:
\[
\text{Number of free cones} = \frac{\text{Total number of customers}}{6} = \frac{50}{6}
\]

Now, simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{50}{6} = 8.3333
\]

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[
\text{Number of free cones} = 8
\]

Thus, the number of free cones Dan gave away is \boxed{8}.

Let's denote the number of free ice cream cones Dan gave away as \( F \).

Since every sixth customer gets a free cone, the number of customers who bought ice cream is \( 6 \times F \).

The total number of cones sold is \( 100 \) (since that's what Dan made from selling them).

The number of customers who got a free cone is \( 6F \).

The number of customers who purchased ice cream cones is \( 6F \) (since that's the denominator of the fraction that represents the 6 customers who got a free one).

The total number of cones sold (customers who bought ice cream) plus the free ones Dan gave away equals \( 100 \).

Thus, \( 6F + F = 100 \).

Combining like terms, we get \( 7F = 100 \).

Dividing both sides by \( 7 \):

\( F = \frac{100}{7} \).

\( F = 14.2857... \).

Since the number of cones must be a whole number, Dan could only have had \( 14 \) free cones.

Therefore, Dan gave away \( 14 \) free ice cream cones.

To determine how many free ice cream cones Dan gave away, we need to first figure out the total number of cones he sold. Since each cone costs $2, the number of cones sold can be calculated by dividing the total sales by the price of one cone.

Number of cones sold = Total sales / Price per cone
Number of cones sold = $100 / $2
Number of cones sold = 50 cones

Dan gives away one free cone for every six customers, so the number of free cones given away can be calculated by dividing the number of cones sold by six.

Number of free cones = Number of cones sold / 6
Number of free cones = 50 / 6
Number of free cones = 8.33...

Since Dan cannot give away a fraction of a cone, we can only give away whole cones. Therefore, Dan gave away 8 free cones.

<reasoning>
For every sixth customer, a free cone is given. This means that out of every six customers, only five purchase a cone. So, any customer purchasing a cone is not eligible for a free one. To find out how many free cones were given away, we can use the fact that the total revenue from cones sold should cover the cost of cones given away.

Let's denote the number of customers as \(n\). Since every sixth customer receives a free cone, the number of cones sold is \(n/6\). The cost of each cone is $2, and the number of cones given away as free ones is \(n/6\). The total number of free cones given away must equal the total number of cones sold. So, the number of free cones, which is equal to the number of cones sold, should be a multiple of 5 (since only 5 out of every 6 customers will buy a cone). Given that 5 customers buy a cone, we know that \(n/6 = 5\). This gives us an equation to solve for \(n\).
</reasoning>

<answer>
First, we calculate how many cones were sold per \(n\) customers: \(n/6\) cones.
Then we calculate the number of free cones: \(n/6\).

Total revenue from cone sales: $100
Then we divide this by the price of each cone to find the number of cones sold: $100/2 = 50 cones.

Now we can find the total number of cones given away as free ones by dividing the cones sold by six: 50/6 = 8 and 2/6 = 8 and 3/6 = 8 and 1/6 = 8 and 1/6 = 8
