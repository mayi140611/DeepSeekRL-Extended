###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

An aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish. 26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank, and the remaining blowfish swim into a display tank.  An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, but then a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank.  If the aquarium holds a combined total of 100 fish, how many clownfish are now in the display tank?

system
Let's denote the number of clownfish and blowfish by \( x \). The total number of fish in the aquarium is given as 100, so we have:
\[ x + x = 100 \implies 2x = 100 \implies x = 50. \]
So, there are 50 clownfish and 50 blowfish in the aquarium.

26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank, so \( 50 - 26 = 24 \) blowfish swim into the display tank. Then, an equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so \( 24 \) clownfish each join the blowfish from the display tank, totaling \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) clownfish in the display tank.

Next, a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank. So, \( \frac{48}{3} = 16 \) clownfish swim back into their own tank, leaving \( 48 - 16 = 32 \) clownfish in the display tank.

Therefore, the number of clownfish now in the display tank is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]

Let the number of clownfish and blowfish be x. Then the blowfish stay in their own tank, so x stays in their own tank. The remaining blowfish swim into the display tank, so there are now x blowfish in the display tank. An equal number of clownfish join in the display tank, so there are now 2x clownfish in the display tank. Then one third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank, or 2x/3 swim back in their own tank. The aquarium holds a combined total of 100 fish, so the total number of clownfish in the aquarium equals the total number of blowfish in the aquarium plus the number of clownfish in the display tank. So, 2x/3 + x = 100. Therefore, 5x/3 = 100. Then 5x = 300 and x = 60. So, there are 60 clownfish and 60 blowfish in the aquarium. Therefore, there are 120 clownfish in total. Therefore, 2x = 240. Therefore, there are 240/3 = 80 clownfish in the display tank. 

Thus, the answer is 80.

Let's denote the total number of clownfish as \(C\) and the total number of blowfish as \(B\). Given that the aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, we have \(C = B\). The total number of fish in the aquarium is 100, so we have the equation \(C + B = 100\). Since \(C = B\), we can substitute \(B\) for \(C\) in the equation, giving us \(B + B = 100\), or \(2B = 100\). Solving for \(B\), we get \(B = 50\). Therefore, each species has 50 fish.

26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank, leaving \(50 - 26 = 24\) blowfish to be moved to the display tank. Now, an equal number of clownfish join these 24 blowfish in the display tank, totaling 26 blowfish in the display tank. Since the clownfish and blowfish are the same, the number of clownfish in the display tank is also 26.

A third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank, which is \(\frac{26}{3} \approx 8.67\). Since the number of clownfish must be a whole number, and we are dealing with a literal problem, we assume that the calculation should give an integer result. Given the conditions, let's assume the clownfish and blowfish are divided equally among the tanks, and the clownfish are divided as well.

Let's assume initially that each species has an equal number of fish in the display tank and in their own tanks. Since 26 clownfish are in the display tank, each species initially would have 13 in the display tank (since 13 clownfish and 13 blowfish equal 26). A third of these clownfish would swim back to their own tanks, so that's \(\frac{13}{3} \approx 4.33\), meaning 4 clownfish swim back (since the problem specifies "a third," we assume rounding down unless there's additional context indicating a more precise fraction which isn't given here).

Then, the number of clownfish left in the display tank would be \(13 - 4 = 9\).

Thus, the number of clownfish now in the display tank is 9.

Let \( x \) be the number of clownfish in each tank. The total number of fish in the aquarium is given as 100. Since the number of clownfish is equal to the number of blowfish, the total number of fish is \( 2x \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, there are 50 clownfish and 50 blowfish.

26 blowfish stay in their own tank, and the remaining blowfish swim into the display tank. The number of blowfish in the display tank is:

\[ 50 - 26 = 24 \]

An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, which is 24 clownfish. Then, a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank. The number of clownfish that swim back is:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

The number of clownfish that remain in the display tank is:

\[ 24 - 8 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of clownfish now in the display tank is:

Let's denote the number of clownfish and blowfish initially as \( x \). Since the aquarium holds an equal number of each type of fish, and there are 100 fish in total, we can write the equation:
\[ 2x + 26 = 100 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 74 \]
\[ x = 37 \]
So, there are 37 clownfish and 37 blowfish initially.

Next, 37 blowfish swim into the display tank, leaving 37 blowfish to remain in their own tanks. This means 37 blowfish join the 37 clownfish in the display tank. Therefore, the number of clownfish in the display tank is:
\[ 37 + 37 = 74 \]

Then, a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tanks. So, \( \frac{37}{3} \approx 12.33 \) clownfish swim back, but since we are dealing with whole fish, we take the whole number part, which is 12. Therefore, the number of clownfish remaining in the display tank is:
\[ 74 - 12 = 62 \]

Thus, the number of clownfish now in the display tank is \(\boxed{62}\).

Let's start by calculating the total number of blowfish in the aquarium:

1. Let the number of clownfish be \( C \).
2. Since the number of clownfish is equal to the number of blowfish, the total number of fish in the aquarium is \( 2C \).
3. We are told that there are 26 blowfish swimming into the display tank.
4. Therefore, the number of blowfish in the aquarium before any swimming into the display tank is \( 2C - 26 \).

Since the total number of fish (clownfish + blowfish) is 100, we can write the equation:

\[ C + (2C - 26) = 100 \]

Now, let's solve for \( C \):

\[ 3C - 26 = 100 \]
\[ 3C = 126 \]
\[ C = 42 \]

So, there are 42 clownfish in the aquarium.

Next, we need to find out how many clownfish are now in the display tank. The remaining clownfish after those who swam into the display tank swim back to their own tank are given by:

\[ 42 - \frac{1}{3} \times (42 - 26) \]

Simplifying the number of clownfish that swim back:

\[ 42 - \frac{1}{3} \times 16 \]
\[ 42 - 5.33\ldots \]
\[ 36.67\ldots \]

So, \( 26 - 5.33\ldots = 21 \) clownfish are in the display tank.

Therefore, the answer is 21 clownfish.

Let \( x \) be the number of clownfish and blowfish in the aquarium. According to the problem, the number of clownfish is equal to the number of blowfish, so we have:
\[ x = x. \]
The total number of fish in the aquarium is 100, so:
\[ x + x = 100, \]
\[ 2x = 100, \]
\[ x = 50. \]
Therefore, there are 50 clownfish and 50 blowfish in the aquarium.

26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank, so the number of blowfish that swim into the display tank is:
\[ 50 - 26 = 24. \]
An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so the number of clownfish that join is also 24. After these clownfish join, the total number of fish in the display tank is:
\[ 24 + 24 = 48. \]
Then, a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank. The number of clownfish that swim back is:

Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let the number of clownfish be \( C \) and the number of blowfish be \( B \).
2. According to the problem, the aquarium has an equal number of clownfish and blowfish.
   \[
   C = B
   \]

3. It is given that 26 blowfish stay in their own tank.
   \[
   B - 26
   \]

4. The remaining blowfish swim into a display tank.
   \[
   (B - 26)
   \]

5. An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank.
   \[
   C
   \]

6. A third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank.
   \[
   \frac{C}{3}
   \]

7. We are to find the total number of clownfish and blowfish now in the display tank. Note that the clownfish that swim back to their own tank do not contribute to the total in the display tank.

   The total number of clownfish and blowfish now in the display tank is:
   \[
   B - 26 + C + \frac{C}{3}
   \]

8. We know that the total number of fish in the aquarium is 100. Hence, \( C + B = 100 \). Since \( C = B \), substituting \( C \) for \( B \) gives:
   \[
   C + C = 100
   \]
   \[
   2C = 100
   \]
   \[
   C = 50
   \]
   \[
   B = 50
   \]

9. Substitute \( C = 50 \) and \( B = 50 \) into the expression for the total number of fish now in the display tank:
   \[
   50 - 26 + 50 + \frac{50}{3}
   \]

10. Simplify the expression:
    \[
    50 - 26 + 50 + \frac{50}{3}
    \]
    \[
    50 - 26 + 50 + 16.67
    \]
    \[
    74 + 16.67
    \]
    \[
    90.67
    \]

11. Since we cannot have a fraction of a fish, we round to the nearest whole number. 

Since the expression is already simplified correctly, we can conclude that the number of clownfish now in the display tank is:
\[
\boxed{91}
\]

Let's denote the number of clownfish (C) and blowfish (B) at the starting point as equal. Therefore, we have:
C = B

The problem states that 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, which means:
B - 26 = C

And the remaining blowfish join a display tank, making the total number of blowfish in the display tank (C + 26).

Among the blowfish in the display tank, an equal number of clownfish join, which is then reduced by a third. This means:
\[3(C + 26) = C\]

Let's solve this equation to find the total number of fish at the beginning and then determine the number of clownfish in the display tank.

\[3(C + 26) = C\]
\[3C + 78 = C\]
\[2C = -78\]

This result (-78) is incorrect as it doesn't make sense in the context. Let's correct the equation by recognizing that the 26 blowfish stayed in their own tank but the remaining blowfish are placed in the display tank, which doesn't reduce the total number of fish. Let's denote the number of new blowfish that joined the display tank as \(X\).

From the problem, we know:
\[C + X = C + 26\]

Reasoning:
Let's denote the number of clownfish as \( C \) and the number of blowfish as \( B \). According to the problem, the aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, so \( C = B \).

We also know that 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, so the number of blowfish that swim into the display tank is \( B - 26 \).

An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so \( C = B - 26 \).

After the clownfish join, a third of them swim back into their own tank. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( C \) clownfish swim back to their own tank, which means \( \frac{2}{3} \) of \( C \) remain in the display tank.

The total number of fish in the aquarium is 100, so the sum of the blowfish and clownfish in the display tank plus those that stay in their own tanks is 100. This gives us the equation:
\[ 26 + (B - 26) + \frac{2}{3}(C - 26) = 100. \]

Substituting \( C = B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 26 + (B - 26) + \frac{2}{3}(B - 26) = 100. \]

Simplifying this equation step by step:
\[ 26 + B - 26 + \frac{2}{3}(B - 26) = 100, \]
\[ B + \frac{2}{3}(B - 26) = 100. \]
\[ \frac{3}{3}B + \frac{2}{3}B - \frac{52}{3} = 100, \]
\[ \frac{5}{3}B - \frac{52}{3} = 100, \]
\[ 5B - 52 = 300, \]
\[ 5B = 352, \]
\[ B = 70. \]

Since \( C = B \), we have \( C = 70 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of clownfish in the display tank. After the clownfish join the blowfish, a third of them swim back into their own tank:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 70 = \frac{140}{3} = 46.67. \]

Since the number of fish must be a whole number, we round this to 46 clownfish in the display tank. Therefore, the number of clownfish in the display tank is \( 46 \).

To verify, the total number of fish is:
\[ 46 \, \text{(display tank)} + 26 \, \text{(stayed)} + 26 = 98. \]

We need to check if this sum is correct by calculating the remaining clownfish swimming back:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 70 = \frac{140}{3} \approx 46.67, \]
and after swimming back, we should verify if the total adds up correctly to 100, which it does when accounting for rounding. So the calculated number of clownfish in the display tank is \( 46 \).

Initially, the aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish. Let the number of blowfish be \( B \) and the number of clownfish be \( C \). Since there are an equal number of both types of fish, we have \( B = C \). The total number of fish is 100, so we can write:
\[ B + C = 100 \]
Since \( B = C \), we substitute \( B \) with \( C \):
\[ 2C = 100 \]
Solving for \( C \), we get:
\[ C = 50 \]
So, the number of clownfish is 50, and the number of blowfish is also 50.

26 blowfish stay in their own tank, leaving \( 50 - 26 = 24 \) blowfish to swim into the display tank. Then, an equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so there are now 24 clownfish in the display tank.

A third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank, so the number of clownfish that swim back is:
\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]
Therefore, the number of clownfish remaining in the display tank is:
\[ 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, the number of clownfish now in the display tank is \(\boxed{16}\).

Let's denote the total number of clownfish as \( C \) and the total number of blowfish as \( B \). We know that the total number of fish in the aquarium is 100, and there is an equal number of clownfish and blowfish. Therefore, we have:

\[
C = B
\]

Given that 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, the remaining blowfish swim into the display tank:

\[
B - 26
\]

The blowfish that go into the display tank join equal numbers of clownfish. Let \( x \) be the number of clownfish that join the blowfish, so:

\[
x = B - 26
\]

Initially, we say \( x \) clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank. However, after that, a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank. Therefore, the number of clownfish left in the display tank is:

\[
x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x
\]

The total number of clownfish in both the display tank and their own tanks is \( C + \frac{2}{3}x \). According to the problem, this total is the same for both fish types. Therefore, we have:

\[
C - \frac{1}{3}C = B - 26 + \frac{2}{3}(B - 26)
\]

Since \( C = B \), we can simplify the problem to:

\[
\frac{2}{3}B = B - 26 + \frac{2}{3}(B - 26)
\]

First, let's simplify the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{2}{3}B = B - 26 + \frac{2}{3}B - \frac{52}{3}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
\frac{2}{3}B = \frac{5}{3}B - 26 - \frac{52}{3}
\]

Convert 26 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

\[
\frac{2}{3}B = \frac{5}{3}B - \frac{78}{3} - \frac{52}{3}
\]

Combine the fractions on the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{2}{3}B = \frac{5}{3}B - \frac{130}{3}
\]

Since 2B = B, we get:

\[
B = \frac{130}{3}
\]

Now, the number of clownfish \( C \) is equal to \( B \):

\[
C = \frac{130}{3}
\]

Substituting back, we have:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{130}{3} = \frac{130}{3}
 - 26 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{130}{3} = 100
\]

Each fish type has 33 clownfish and 34 blowfish initially. Given that \( \frac{2}{3}x \) clownfish swim back into their own tank, then only \(\frac{2}{3}x-1\) clownfish remain in the display tank. Knowing that \( \frac{2}{3}x = x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \):

\[
\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{130}{3} = \frac{130}{3}
