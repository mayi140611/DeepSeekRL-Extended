system
Ali started with 180 seashells. He gave away 40 seashells to his friends and 30 seashells to his brothers. Before selling, the number of seashells he had left was 180 - 40 - 30 = 110. So, before selling, Ali had 110 seashells. Half of the remaining seashells were sold, which means 110 / 2 = 55 seashells were sold. Therefore, Ali had 55 seashells left.

Ali started with 180 seashells. He gave away 40 to his friends, leaving him with \(180 - 40 = 140\) seashells. Then he gave 30 to his brothers, leaving him with \(140 - 30 = 110\) seashells. Since he sold half of the remaining seashells, he sold \(110 / 2 = 55\) seashells. Therefore, he had \(110 - 55 = 55\) seashells left.

#### GENERATION 3 RESPONSE ####


system
Initially, Ali had 180 seashells. He gave away 40 seashells to his friends and 30 seashells to his brothers. So, the total number of seashells given away is:

\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Subtracting this from the initial amount gives:

\[ 180 - 70 = 110 \]

He sold half of the remaining seashells. Half of 110 is:

\[ \frac{110}{2} = 55 \]

So, the number of seashells he had left after selling half is:

\[ 110 - 55 = 55 \]

Ali initially had 180 seashells. He gave away 40 to his friends and 30 to his brothers, which totals \(40 + 30 = 70\) seashells given away.

So, the number of seashells left after giving away to his friends and brothers is \(180 - 70 = 110\) seashells.

Then, he sold half of the remaining seashells. Half of 110 seashells is \(110 / 2 = 55\) seashells sold.

The number of seashells left after selling is \(110 - 55 = 55\).

To find out how many seashells Ali had left after giving some away and selling some, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of seashells.
2. Subtract the number of seashells given to friends.
3. Subtract the number of seashells given to brothers.
4. Calculate the remaining seashells after giving some away.
5. Determine how many seashells he sold by taking half of the remaining seashells.
6. Subtract the seashells sold from the remaining seashells to find out how many he had left.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Initial number of seashells: 180
2. After giving away 40 seashells: 180 - 40 = 140
3. After giving away 30 seashells: 140 - 30 = 110
4. After selling half of the remaining seashells: 110 - (110/2) = 110 - 55 = 55

Therefore, Ali had 55 seashells left.

Ali started with 180 seashells. He gave away 40 seashells to his friends and 30 seashells to his brothers in one go. So, the total number of seashells he gave away is:

40 (to friends) + 30 (to brothers) = 70 seashells.

The total number of seashells left after giving away to friends and brothers is:

180 (original) - 70 (given away) = 110 seashells.

Then, Ali sold half of the remaining seashells. So, the number of seashells he sold is:

110 / 2 = 55 seashells.

The number of seashells he has left after selling half is:

110 (remaining) - 55 (sold) = 55 seashells.

First, let's calculate the total number of seashells Ali gave away initially. He gave away 40 seashells to his friends and 30 seashells to his brothers, which totals to \(40 + 30 = 70\) seashells.

Next, let's find out how many seashells Ali had left after giving away the seashells to his friends and brothers. He started with 180 seashells, so after giving away 70 seashells, he had \(180 - 70 = 110\) seashells remaining.

Finally, Ali sold half of the remaining seashells. Since he had 110 seashells left, he sold \( \frac{110}{2} = 55 \) seashells. 

To find out how many seashells Ali had left after selling half of the remaining seashells, we subtract the seashells sold from the remaining seashells, which is \(110 - 55 = 55\).

Therefore, Ali had 55 seashells left.
