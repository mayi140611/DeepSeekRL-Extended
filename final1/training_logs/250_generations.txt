#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####


system
Each weight plate feels like 30 * 20% = 6 pounds heavier.
So each weight feels 30 + 6 = 36 pounds.

10 weight plates gives a total of 36 * 10 = 360 pounds.

Each weight plate feels like 30*2=60 pounds
So 10 weight plates feel like 60*10=600 pounds
When lowering the weight, the pounds feels like 600*.2=120 pounds heavier
So the weights feel like 600+120=720 pounds

The normal weight of each plate is 30 pounds. When the weights are 20% heavier on the lowering portion, the additional weight is 30 pounds * 0.20 = 6 pounds. So the weight felt while lowering portion of the exercise machine is 30 pounds + 6 pounds = 36 pounds.

Each weight plate feels like 30*20% = 6 extra pounds.
So each plate feels like 30+6 = 36 pounds
With 10 plates, the weights feel like 36*10 = 360 pounds when being lowered.

Each plate feels 20/100 * 30 = 6 pounds heavier when being lowered.
So each plate now feels 30 + 6 = 36 pounds.
Tom has 10 weight plates so the machine feels like 36 * 10 = 360 pounds.

#### GENERATION 6 RESPONSE ####


system
Each weight plate feels like 30 * 0.2 = 6% heavier.
So the weight of each plate when being lowered is 30 pounds + 30 pounds * 0.06 = 31.8 pounds.
Therefore, the answer is 31.8.

The regular weight of the plates is \(10 \times 30 = 300\) pounds. Since the weights feel 20% heavier on the lowering portion, the additional weight is \(300 \times 0.20 = 60\) pounds. Adding this to the regular weight gives the total weight being felt when being lowered: \(300 + 60 = 360\) pounds.

Each weight plate feels 20% heavier or 0.2*30 (the original weight) = 6 pounds heavier.
The 10 plates weigh 10*30 = 300 pounds when not on the machine.
On the machine, they feel 300+6 = 306 pounds.
