system
Let \( W \) represent the wholesale price of the pair of pants. According to the problem, the store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price. Therefore, the retail price can be expressed as:

\[
W + 0.8W = 1.8W
\]

We know the retail price is $36. Thus, we can set up the following equation:

\[
1.8W = 36
\]

To find \( W \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.8:

\[
W = \frac{36}{1.8} = 20
\]

So, the wholesale price of the pair of pants is \( \$20 \).

Let the wholesale price be \( w \).

The retail price is 100% of the wholesale price plus an additional 80%, so:

\[ 100\% \times w + 80\% \times w = 36 \]

\[ 1.8w = 36 \]

To find \( w \), we divide both sides by 1.8:

\[ w = \frac{36}{1.8} \]

\[ w = 20 \]

So, the wholesale price is $20.

Let the wholesale price of the pair of pants be \( x \). The store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price, which is given as $36. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.8x = 36 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 1.8x = 36 \]

To find the wholesale price \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.8:

\[ x = \frac{36}{1.8} \]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[ x = 20 \]

So, the wholesale price of the pair of pants is $20.

Let's denote the wholesale price of the pair of pants as \( W \).

According to the information given, the retail price \( R \) is calculated by adding 80% to the wholesale price \( W \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[
R = W + 0.80W
\]

Given that the retail price \( R \) is $36, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[
36 = W + 0.80W
\]

Simplifying the equation by combining like terms on the right side:

\[
36 = 1W + 0.80W = 1.80W
\]

To solve for \( W \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.80:

\[
W = \frac{36}{1.80}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
W = 20
\]

Therefore, the wholesale price of the pair of pants is $20.

Let's denote the wholesale price by \( W \). According to the problem, the retail price is set by adding 80% of the wholesale price to the wholesale price itself. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ R = W + 0.8W = 1.8W \]
where \( R \) is the retail price.

We know that the retail price of the pair of pants is $36. So we can set up the following equation:
\[ 1.8W = 36 \]

To find the wholesale price \( W \), we need to solve this equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 1.8:
\[ W = \frac{36}{1.8} \]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[ W = \frac{36 \div 0.6}{1.8 \div 0.6} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, the wholesale price is $20.

Let's denote the wholesale price of the pair of pants as \( W \).

The retail price is calculated by adding 80% of the wholesale price to the wholesale price itself. Therefore, we can write the equation as:
\[ \text{Retail Price} = W + 0.80W = 1.80W \]

Given that the retail price is $36:
\[ 1.80W = 36 \]

To find \( W \), we divide both sides by 1.80:
\[ W = \frac{36}{1.80} \]

Now let's calculate \( W \):
\[ W = 20 \]

To find the wholesale price of the pair of pants, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Retail Price} = \text{Wholesale Price} + \text{Markup} \]

Given that the markup is 80% and the retail price is $36, we can solve for the wholesale price. Let \( W \) represent the wholesale price.

\[ 36 = W + 0.80W \]
\[ 36 = 1.80W \]

Now, we can solve for \( W \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.80:

\[ W = \frac{36}{1.80} \]
\[ W = 20 \]

So, the wholesale price of the pair of pants is $20.

</answer>
<reasoning>
Given that the retail price of a pair of pants is $36 and the markup is 80%, we can represent the markup as a multiplier of the wholesale price. Let's denote the wholesale price as \( W \). Since the markup is 80%, we can write the relationship as:

\[ 36 = W \times (1 + 0.80) \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 36 = W \times 1.80 \]

To isolate \( W \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.80:

\[ W = \frac{36}{1.80} \]

Calculating the value:

\[ W = 20 \]

Therefore, the wholesale price of the pair of pants is $20.

To find the wholesale price, we can set up a proportion where the retail price is the sum of the wholesale price and 80% of the wholesale price.

Let W be the wholesale price.
The retail price is 100% of the wholesale price plus 80% of the wholesale price, which is equal to 100% of the wholesale price (100% + 80% = 180%). So we have:

W + 0.8W = $36

Combining like terms, we get:

1.8W = $36

Now we can solve for W by dividing both sides by 1.8:

W = $36 / 1.8
W = $20

The wholesale price of the pair of pants is $20.

To find the wholesale price, we can use the following calculation:
Retail Price = Wholesale Price + (Wholesale Price * Tax Rate)
In this case, the tax rate (80%) is added to the wholesale price to get the retail price. So we can rearrange the formula to solve for the wholesale price:
Wholesale Price = Retail Price / (1 + Tax Rate)
Substituting the given values, we get:
Wholesale Price = $36 / (1 + 0.8)
Calculating this gives us a Wholesale Price of $15.

Let the wholesale price of the pair of pants be denoted by \( x \). The store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price. Therefore, the retail price can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (1 + 0.8) = 36 \]
