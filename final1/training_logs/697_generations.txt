<reasoning>
First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the 3 pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so 3 pizzas total 3 * 12 = 36 slices.

Next, we need to determine the cost per slice. The total cost is $72, so the cost per slice is $72 / 36 slices = $2 per slice.

Now, we want to find out the cost of 5 slices. Since each slice costs $2, 5 slices would cost $2 * 5 = $10.

To find the cost of 5 slices, we first need to determine the cost per slice of pizza. 

1. Calculate the total number of slices: \( 3 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 36 \text{ slices} \)
2. Calculate the cost per slice: \( \frac{72 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ slices}} = 2 \text{ dollars/slice} \)
3. Calculate the cost of 5 slices: \( 5 \text{ slices} \times 2 \text{ dollars/slice} = 10 \text{ dollars} \)

Therefore, the cost of 5 slices is 10 dollars.

To determine the cost of 5 slices of pizza, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   Kim buys 3 pizzas, and each pizza has 12 slices.
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per slice:**
   The total cost for 36 slices is $72. Therefore, the cost per slice is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per slice} = \frac{72}{36} = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of 5 slices:**
   If each slice costs $2, then the cost of 5 slices is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 5 slices} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

Therefore, the cost of 5 slices of pizza is \(\boxed{10}\).

To determine the cost of 5 slices of pizza, we first need to calculate the total number of slices available and then use the total cost to find the cost per slice.

1. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - Kim buys 3 pizzas.
   - Total number of slices = 3 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 36 slices.

2. **Calculate the cost per slice:**
   - The total cost of the pizzas is $72.
   - The total number of slices is 36.
   - Cost per slice = Total cost / Total number of slices = $72 / 36 slices = $2 per slice.

3. **Calculate the cost of 5 slices:**
   - Cost of 5 slices = 5 slices * $2 per slice = $10.

To find out how much 5 slices cost, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices of pizza Kim bought.
2. Determine the total cost of all the slices.
3. Find out the cost of one slice of pizza.
4. Calculate the cost of 5 slices.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices of pizza.
Kim bought 3 pizzas, and each pizza has 12 slices.
\[ \text{Total slices} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of all the slices.
The total cost of all the slices of pizza is $72.

Step 3: Find out the cost of one slice of pizza.
\[ \text{Cost per slice} = \frac{\text{Total cost of all the slices}}{\text{Total number of slices}} = \frac{72}{36} = 2 \text{ dollars per slice} \]

Step 4: Calculate the cost of 5 slices.

First, we need to determine the total number of slices and the cost per slice. There are a total of 3 pizzas, each containing 12 slices, so there are \(3 \times 12 = 36\) slices. The total cost of the pizzas is $72, so the cost per slice is \( \frac{72}{36} = 2 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much 5 slices cost, we multiply the cost per slice by 5, which is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

First, we need to determine the total number of slices of pizza that Kim bought. Since each pizza has 12 slices and Kim bought 3 pizzas, the total number of slices she bought is 3 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 36 slices. 

Next, we need to find out how much one slice costs. We can do this by dividing the total cost of the pizzas by the total number of slices. The total cost of the pizzas is $72 and the total number of slices is 36, so the cost per slice is $72 / 36 slices = $2 per slice.

Now, we need to determine how much 5 slices cost. Since each slice costs $2, the cost of 5 slices is $2/slice * 5 slices = $10.

To find out how much 5 slices cost, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices in the 3 pizzas.
2. Determine the cost per slice.
3. Calculate the cost for 5 slices.

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Total number of slices = Number of pizzas × Number of slices per pizza
   Total number of slices = 3 × 12
   Total number of slices = 36

2. Cost per slice = Total cost ÷ Total number of slices
   Cost per slice = $72 ÷ 36
   Cost per slice = $2

3. Cost of 5 slices = Cost per slice × Number of slices
   Cost of 5 slices = $2 × 5
   Cost of 5 slices = $10

So, 5 slices cost $10.
