###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

Lana and her friends go to a theater on the weekend to watch a new play Joan told them was live. When they arrived, Lana saw 100 cars in the front parking lot. She saw two times more vehicles at the back than there were in the front parking lot. If the total number of cars at the end of the play was 700, how many more cars packed into the parking lot during the play?

<reasoning>
Let's calculate the total number of vehicles at the back parking lot.

Lana sees 100 cars in the front parking lot. At the back there are two times more vehicles, so that’s \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cars. 
So, the total number of vehicles at the back parking lot is \(200 + 100 = 300\). 

Adding the cars from the front and back, \(100 + 200 = 300\) vehicles.

The play goes on for a few hours and the total numbers of vehicles increases from 300 to 700. The increase in the number of vehicles during the play is \(700 - 300 = 400\).

Therefore, the number of more cars that packed into the parking lot during the play is 400.

Let's denote the number of vehicles at the front parking lot as \( F \) and the number of vehicles at the back parking lot as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( F = 100 \) (number of vehicles at the front parking lot)
2. \( B = 2 \times F \) (number of vehicles at the back parking lot is twice the number in the front parking lot)

We can calculate \( B \) as follows:
\[ B = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

If the total number of vehicles in the parking lot at the end of the play was 700, and \( F + B \) represented the number of vehicles at that point, we can calculate the initial number of vehicles by subtracting the number at the end of the play (700) from the total:
\[ \text{Initial vehicles} = 700 - 700 = 0 \]

However, the initial number of vehicles (0) indicates that 0 new cars arrived during the play, and 0 were removed, which suggests that all the cars were accounted for by the end of the play. This might suggest there was a misunderstanding of the problem setup, or perhaps there is an error in the provided information.

To proceed correctly, we need to reconcile the given information:
\[ F + B + (\text{new cars arrived}) = 700 \]
\[ 100 + 200 + (\text{new cars arrived}) = 700 \]
\[ 300 + (\text{new cars arrived}) = 700 \]
\[ (\text{new cars arrived}) = 700 - 300 \]
\[ (\text{new cars arrived}) = 400 \]

So, Lana saw 100 cars at the front, 200 at the back, and 400 new cars arrived during the play. The final number of cars is:
\[ \text{Total cars} = 100 + 200 + 400 = 700 \]
And we know the total number of cars was 700 at the end of the play.

Therefore, the number of new cars that packed into the parking lot during the play is 400.

Let's start by determining how many vehicles were in the back parking lot. According to the information given, there were two times more vehicles in the back parking lot than in the front. Since there were 100 vehicles in the front parking lot, we can calculate the number of vehicles in the back as follows:

$$
\text{Number of vehicles in the back} = 2 \times \text{Number of vehicles in the front} = 2 \times 100 = 200
$$

Now, let's find the total number of vehicles in the front and back parking lots before the play began:

$$
\text{Total vehicles before the play} = \text{Number of vehicles in the front} + \text{Number of vehicles in the back} = 100 + 200 = 300
$$

The total number of cars at the end of the play was given as 700. To find out how many more cars packed into the parking lot during the play, we subtract the total number of vehicles present before the play from the total number of cars at the end of the play:

$$
\text{Increase in vehicles} = \text{Total cars at the end of the play} - \text{Total vehicles before the play} = 700 - 300 = 400
$$

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cars seen in the back of the parking lot and then determine how many more cars packed into the parking lot during the play.

First, we know that Lana saw 100 cars in the front parking lot. According to the problem, the number of vehicles in the back is two times the number in the front. Therefore, the number of cars in the back is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Next, to find the total number of cars at the end of the play, we add the number of cars in the front and the number of cars in the back. This gives us \(100 + 200 = 300\) cars.

The total number of cars at the end of the play was 700. This means that the number of cars that packed into the parking lot during the play is the total number of cars at the end of the play minus the number of cars at the beginning of the play. Therefore, the number of additional cars that packed into the parking lot during the play is \(700 - 300 = 400\).

So, 400 more cars packed into the parking lot during the play.

Let's denote the number of cars in the front parking lot as \( F \) and the number of cars in the back parking lot as \( B \). According to the problem, Lana saw 100 cars in the front parking lot, so \( F = 100 \). The problem states that there are two times more vehicles at the back than there were in the front parking lot, so \( B = 2 \times F \). Substituting \( F = 100 \), we get \( B = 2 \times 100 = 200 \).

The total number of cars at the end of the play was 700. Therefore, the number of cars that packed into the parking lot during the play is the total number of cars at the end of the play minus the number of cars that were there initially, which is:
\[ 700 - (F + B) = 700 - (100 + 200) = 700 - 300 = 400 \]

Thus, 400 more cars packed into the parking lot during the play.

2. \( B = 2 \times F = 2 \times 100 = 200 \)

To find out how many more cars packed into the parking lot during the play, we need to break down the information given:

1. Lana saw 100 cars in the front parking lot.
2. The back parking lot had two times more vehicles than the front parking lot.
3. The total number of cars at the end of the play was 700.

First, we calculate the number of cars in the back parking lot:
- Back parking lot = 2 × Front parking lot
- Back parking lot = 2 × 100
- Back parking lot = 200

Next, we calculate the total number of cars before the play:
- Total cars before play = Front parking lot + Back parking lot
- Total cars before play = 100 + 200
- Total cars before play = 300

Now, we find out how many cars packed into the parking lot during the play:
- Cars packed into the parking lot during the play = Total cars at the end of the play - Total cars before play
- Cars packed into the parking lot during the play = 700 - 300
- Cars packed into the parking lot during the play = 400

Let's denote the number of cars in the front parking lot as \( F \) and the number of cars in the back parking lot as \( B \).

According to the problem, Lana saw 100 cars in the front parking lot, so \( F = 100 \).

The problem states that there were two times more vehicles at the back than there were in the front parking lot, so \( B = 2F \).

Substituting the value of \( F \), we get \( B = 2 \times 100 = 200 \).

The total number of cars at the end of the play was 700, which includes all the cars from both parking lots and the additional cars that packed into the parking lot during the play. Let \( x \) be the number of additional cars that packed into the parking lot during the play.

So, the total number of cars in the parking lot can be expressed as the sum of the cars in both parking lots and the additional cars during the play, i.e., \( F + B + x = 700 \).

Substituting the values of \( F \) and \( B \), we get \( 100 + 200 + x = 700 \).

Simplifying this equation, we get \( 300 + x = 700 \), which further simplifies to \( x = 700 - 300 \) or \( x = 400 \).

Therefore, 400 more cars packed into the parking lot during the play.
