system
Given that Thor is 13 times older than Captain America and Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker, we need to find:

- The age of Thor,
- The age of Captain America,
- The age of Peter Parker, and
- The age of Ironman.

Firstly, Thor's age is given as 1456 years. According to the problem, Thor is 13 times older than Captain America.

\[ \text{Age of Captain America} = \frac{\text{Age of Thor}}{13} \]

\[ \text{Age of Captain America} = \frac{1456}{13} = 112 \]

So, Captain America is 112 years old.

Next, since Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker:

\[ \text{Age of Peter Parker} = \frac{\text{Age of Captain America}}{7} \]

\[ \text{Age of Peter Parker} = \frac{112}{7} = 16 \]

So, Peter Parker is 16 years old.

We now know the age of Peter Parker. According to the problem, Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker:

\[ \text{Age of Ironman} = \text{Age of Peter Parker} + 32 \]

\[ \text{Age of Ironman} = 16 + 32 = 48 \]

Therefore, Ironman is 48 years old.

Thor is 13 times older than Captain America, so Captain America is 1456/13 = 112 years old.

Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker, so Peter Parker is 112/7 = 16 years old.

Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker, so Ironman is 16 + 32 = 48 years old.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Thor is 13 times older than Captain America.
2. Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker.
3. Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker.
4. Thor is 1456 years old.

From point 1, we get:
\[ \text{Captain America's age} = \frac{\text{Thor's age}}{13} = \frac{1456}{13} = 116 \text{ years} \]

From point 2, we get:
\[ \text{Peter Parker's age} = \frac{\text{Captain America's age}}{7} = \frac{116}{7} \approx 16.57 \text{ years} \]

However, Peter Parker's age should be an integer, so let's check the calculations again:
\[ \text{Peter Parker's age} = \frac{1456}{13} = 116 \text{ years} \]

Now, since Ironman's age is 32 years more than Peter Parker:
\[ \text{Ironman's age} = \text{Peter Parker's age} + 32 = 116 + 32 = 148 \]

#### GENERATION 4 RESPONSE ####


system
Let's denote the ages of Thor, Captain America, Peter Parker, and Ironman as \( T \), \( C \), \( P \), and \( I \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Thor is 13 times older than Captain America:
\[ T = 13C \]

2. Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker:
\[ C = 7P \]

3. Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker:
\[ I = P + 32 \]

4. Thor is 1456 years old:
\[ T = 1456 \]

From the first relationship, we can substitute \( T \) in the equation \( T = 13C \):
\[ 1456 = 13C \]
\[ C = \frac{1456}{13} \]
\[ C = 112 \]

Now, using the second relationship \( C = 7P \), we can substitute \( C \) into this equation:
\[ 112 = 7P \]
\[ P = \frac{112}{7} \]
\[ P = 16 \]

Finally, using the third relationship \( I = P + 32 \), we can substitute \( P \) into this equation:
\[ I = 16 + 32 \]
\[ I = 48 \]

So, Ironman is 48 years old.

Let's denote the ages of Thor, Captain America, Peter Parker, and Ironman as \( T \), \( Ca \), \( P \), and \( I \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. Thor is 13 times older than Captain America:
   \[
   T = 13 \times Ca
   \]
2. Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker:
   \[
   Ca = 7 \times P
   \]
3. Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker:
   \[
   I = P + 32
   \]
4. We are given that Thor is 1456 years old:
   \[
   T = 1456
   \]

First, we substitute \( T = 1456 \) into the first equation to find \( Ca \):
\[
1456 = 13 \times Ca \implies Ca = \frac{1456}{13} = 112
\]

Next, we use \( Ca = 112 \) to find \( P \) from the second equation:
\[
112 = 7 \times P \implies P = \frac{112}{7} = 16
\]

Finally, we use \( P = 16 \) to find \( I \) from the third equation:
\[
I = P + 32 = 16 + 32 = 48
\]

Therefore, Ironman is 48 years old.

Given that Thor is 1456 years old and Thor is 13 times older than Captain America, we can determine Captain America's age as follows:

\[ \text{Captain America's age} = \frac{\text{Thor's age}}{13} = \frac{1456}{13} \]

\[ \text{Captain America's age} = \text{7 times Peter Parker's age} \]

From this, we can find Peter Parker's age as:

\[ \text{Peter Parker's age} = \frac{\text{Captain America's age}}{7} = \frac{1456}{13 \times 7} \]

\[ \text{Ironman's age} = \text{Peter Parker's age} + 32 \]

Substituting the known values or calculated values, we find:

\[ \text{Ironman's age} = \frac{1456}{13 \times 7} + 32 = \frac{1456}{91} + 32 \]

\[ \text{Ironman's age} = \text{Peter Parker's age} + 32 = \frac{1456}{91} + 32 = 16 + 32 = 48 \]

Let's denote the ages of Thor, Captain America, Peter Parker, and Ironman as \( T \), \( C \), \( P \), and \( I \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Thor is 13 times older than Captain America:
\[ T = 13C \]

2. Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker:
\[ C = 7P \]

3. Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker:
\[ I = P + 32 \]

We also know that Thor is 1456 years old, so:
\[ T = 1456 \]

Using \( T = 13C \), we can solve for \( C \):
\[ 1456 = 13C \]
\[ C = \frac{1456}{13} = 112 \]

Now we substitute \( C = 112 \) into the equation \( C = 7P \) to find \( P \):
\[ 112 = 7P \]
\[ P = \frac{112}{7} = 16 \]

Finally, we substitute \( P = 16 \) into the equation \( I = P + 32 \) to find \( I \):
\[ I = 16 + 32 = 48 \]

So, Ironman is 48 years old.

Thor's age is 13 times older than Captain America and 1456 years old. So Thor's age = Captain America's age * 13.
Captain America's age = Ironman's age - 32
Captain America's age = Peter Parker's age * 7

Let's denote:
- Thor's age as T
- Captain America's age as Ca
- Ironman's age as I
- Peter Parker's age as P

From the information given:
1. T = 13 * Ca
2. Ca = P * 7
3. I = P + 32
4. T = 1456

Substituting the value of T from 1 into 4, we get:
13 * Ca = 1456

Solving for Ca:
Ca = 1456 / 13
Ca = 112

Now, using the value of Ca in 2, we get:
P = Ca / 7
P = 112 / 7
P = 16

Now we can find Ironman's age using 3:
I = P + 32
I = 16 + 32
I = 48

So, Ironman is 48 years old.
