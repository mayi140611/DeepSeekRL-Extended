First, let's calculate the total cost of cultivating the farm. The farmer spent $50 on corn seeds, $35 on fertilizers and pesticides, and $15 on labor. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 50 + 35 + 15 = 100 \]

Next, the farmer wants to make a profit of 10% on his total cost. To find 10% of his total cost, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.10 = 10 \]

So, the total profit he wants to make is $10. To find out how much he should sell each bag of corn for to achieve this profit, we subtract the total cost from the total profit:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

Since the farmer gathered 10 bags of corn, we divide the total profit by the number of bags to find the selling price per bag:

\[ \frac{90}{10} = 9 \]

Therefore, the farmer should sell each bag of corn for $9 to make a profit of 10%.

To determine the price at which the farmer should sell each bag of corn to make a 10% profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Cost**: First, we compute the total amount spent by the farmer on cultivating the farm.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$50 + \$35 + \$15 = \$100
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Expected Revenue**: Since the farmer wants to earn a 10% profit, we first calculate what 10% of the total cost is, and then add it to the total cost for the expected revenue.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 10\% \times \$100 = 0.10 \times \$100 = \$10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Expected Revenue} = \$100 + \$10 = \$110
   \]

3. **Determine Price per Bag**: The total expected revenue needs to be divided by the number of bags to find out the selling price per bag.
   \[
   \text{Price per bag} = \frac{\$110}{10 \text{ bags}} = \$11 \text{ per bag}
   \]

So, the farmer should sell each bag of corn for \$11 to make a profit of 10%.

To find out how much the farmer should sell each bag of corn to make a 10% profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the farm inputs.
2. Calculate the target revenue to achieve a 10% profit.
3. Divide the target revenue by the number of bags to determine the price per bag.

First, let's calculate the total cost:
- Corn seeds: $50
- Fertilizers and pesticides: $35
- Labor: $15
Total cost = $50 + $35 + $15 = $100

For a 10% profit, we need to find the target revenue that, after covering the total cost, leaves a 10% profit.

Target revenue = Total cost + 10% of total cost
Target revenue = $100 + 0.10 × $100 = $100 + $10 = $110

Now, to find the price per bag:
Total revenue = Number of bags × Price per bag

To find the price per bag:
Price per bag = Total revenue / Number of bags
Price per bag = $110 / 10 bags = $11 per bag

Therefore, the farmer should sell each bag of corn for $11 to achieve a 10% profit.

To determine the selling price per bag of corn to achieve a 10% profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and labor, and then find out what 10% more than this total is.

The total cost is calculated as follows:
- Cost of corn seeds: $50
- Cost of fertilizers and pesticides: $35
- Cost of labor: $15
- Total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 50 + 35 + 15 = 100 \]

To make a 10% profit, the selling price \( P \) needs to be such that:
\[ P = C + 0.10C = 1.10C \]

Substituting the total cost \( C \) into the equation:
\[ P = 1.10 \times 100 = 110 \]

Therefore, the selling price per bag of corn is $110.

First, we need to calculate the total cost incurred by the farmer. This includes the cost of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, and labor. The total cost is $50 (corn seeds) + $35 (fertilizers and pesticides) + $15 (labor) = $100.

Next, we need to calculate the desired profit. The farmer wants to make a profit of 10%, so we need to find 10% of the total cost. This is $100 x 10% = $10.

To find out how much he should sell each bag for to achieve the profit, we need to add the profit to the total cost and then divide by the number of bags. So, $100 (total cost) + $10 (desired profit) = $110. This amount is the total value that the farmer needs to receive from the sale of all 10 bags.

To find out how much he should sell each bag for, we divide the total value by the number of bags: $110 / 10 = $11.

Therefore, he should sell each bag for $11 to achieve a 10% profit.

To determine how much the farmer should sell each bag of corn, we first need to calculate the total cost of his farming activities.

Total cost = Cost of corn seeds + Cost of fertilizers and pesticides + Cost of labor
Total cost = $50 + $35 + $15
Total cost = $100

To achieve a 10% profit, the total revenue needed should be 110% of the total cost.

Total revenue = Total cost * (1 + Profit margin)
Total revenue = $100 * 1.10
Total revenue = $110

Since the farmer has harvested 10 bags of corn, we divide the total revenue by the number of bags to find out how much he needs to sell each bag.

Price per bag = Total revenue / Number of bags
Price per bag = $110 / 10
Price per bag = $11

The farmer should sell each bag of corn for $11 to achieve a 10% profit.

To determine how much the farmer should sell each bag of corn to make a profit of 10%, we first need to calculate the total cost of his venture and then find the selling price that would result in a 10% profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost:
Cost of corn seeds = $50
Cost of fertilizers and pesticides = $35
Labor cost = $15

Total cost = $50 + $35 + $15 = $100

The farmer wants to make a 10% profit on the total cost. Therefore, the total revenue required to achieve this profit is:
Required profit = $100 * 10% = $10

Total revenue = Total cost + Required profit
Total revenue = $100 + $10 = $110

Now, we can find out how much to sell each bag of corn:
Number of bags = 10

Price per bag = Total revenue / Number of bags
Price per bag = $110 / 10 = $11

So, the farmer should sell each bag of corn for $11 to make a 10% profit.

To determine the selling price per bag of corn to achieve a 10% profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the farm operations. The total cost is the sum of the cost of seeds, fertilizers, and labor:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$50 + \$35 + \$15 = \$100 \]

The farmer wants to make a 10% profit on his total cost. Therefore, the profit should be \( 10\% \) of the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = 0.10 \times \$100 = \$10 \]

The total revenue required to achieve this profit and cover the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Profit} = \$100 + \$10 = \$110 \]

Since the farmer is selling 10 bags of corn, the selling price per bag is:

\[ \text{Selling Price per Bag} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Number of Bags}} = \frac{\$110}{10} = \$11 \]

Therefore, the farmer should sell each bag of corn for $11 to achieve a 10% profit.

To calculate how much the farmer should sell each bag of corn to make a profit of 10%, we first need to determine the total cost of the operation. The total cost is the sum of the expenses on corn seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, and labor. This will give us the base amount from which we need to make a 10% profit.

Total cost = Cost of corn seeds + Cost of fertilizers and pesticides + Cost of labor
           = $50 + $35 + $15
           = $100

To make a 10% profit, the total revenue needs to be 110% of the total cost. Therefore, the total revenue required is:

Total revenue = Total cost + (Total cost * 10%)
              = $100 + ($100 * 0.10)
              = $100 + $10
              = $110

The farmer has sold 10 bags of corn, so the price per bag is calculated as:

Price per bag = Total revenue / Number of bags
             = $110 / 10
             = $11

Therefore, the farmer should sell each bag of corn for $11 to achieve a 10% profit.

The total expenses for the farmer are $50 on corn seeds, $35 on fertilizers and pesticides, and $15 on labor, which sums up to $100. He wants to make a profit of 10%, so the total selling price should include the initial expenses plus the total profit. To find the selling price per bag, we first calculate the desired profit and then add it to the total expenses.

Total expenses = $100

Desired profit = 10% of $100 = 0.10 * $100 = $10

Total selling price for 10 bags = $100 (expenses) + $10 (profit) = $110

To find the selling price per bag, we divide the total selling price by the number of bags:

Selling price per bag = $110 / 10 bags = $11 per bag.

Now we calculate the profit per bag:

Profit per bag = Selling price per bag - Cost per bag
\[ \text{Profit per bag} = 11 - 10 = $1 \]

Therefore, the farmer should sell each bag for $11 to achieve a 10% profit.

To determine how much the farmer should sell each bag of corn to achieve a 10% profit, we first need to calculate the total cost incurred for the seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and labor.

The total investment is given by:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of seeds} + \text{Cost of fertilizers and pesticides} + \text{Labor cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$50 + \$35 + \$15 = \$100 \]

The farmer aims to make a 10% profit on the total investment. To find the selling price that accounts for this profit, we need to calculate the selling price which includes the cost of the seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and labor, as well as the profit.

The formula for the selling price (SP) is:
\[ \text{SP} = \frac{\text{Total cost} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage})}{100} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{SP} = \frac{\$100 \times (1 + 0.10)}{100} = \frac{\$100 \times 1.10}{100} = \$110 \]

Since the farmer has 10 bags of corn, the selling price per bag will be the total selling price divided by the number of bags:
\[ \text{Selling price per bag} = \frac{\$110}{10} = \$11 \]

So, the farmer should sell each bag of corn for $11 to make a 10% profit.
