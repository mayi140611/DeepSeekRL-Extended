To determine how much money is left after the girl scouts pay for the pool, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 people to go to the pool and subtract it from the total amount of money they earned from selling cookies.

1. Calculate the total cost for 10 people:
   - The cost per person is $2.50.
   - Number of people going is 10.
   - Total cost = 2.50 * 10 = $25.

2. Subtract the total cost from the total amount earned:
   - Total amount earned = $30.
   - Total cost = $25.
   - Amount left = 30 - 25 = $5.

Therefore, the amount left is **$5**.

To find out how much money the Girl Scouts have left, we first need to calculate the total cost for 10 people to go to the pool.

The cost per person is $2.50, and there are 10 people going, so the total cost is:
10 people * $2.50/person = $25.00

The Girl Scouts earned $30 from selling cookies, but they need $25 for the pool. So, the amount left is:
$30.00 - $25.00 = $5.00

The amount left after paying for the pool is $5.00.

Let's break down the problem:

1. The girl scouts earned $30 from selling cookies.
2. The cost to go to the pool is $2.50 per person, and there are 10 people going.
3. We need to calculate the total cost, then subtract that from the money earned to find the amount left.

First, calculate the total cost for 10 people:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 2.50 \times 10 = 25 \]

Now, subtract the total cost from the money earned:

\[ \text{Amount left} = 30 - 25 = 5 \]

Therefore, the amount left is $5.

The cost for 10 people to go to the pool is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per person} = 2.50 \]
\[ \text{Number of people} = 10 \]

So, the total cost for 10 people is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per person} \times \text{Number of people} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2.50 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 \]

They earned $30 from selling cookies, so the amount left after paying for the pool is:
\[ \text{Amount left} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Total cost} \]
\[ \text{Amount left} = 30 - 25 \]
\[ \text{Amount left} = 5 \]

To find out how much money is left after all the costs, we first calculate the total cost for 10 people to go to the pool. This is done by multiplying the cost per person (\$2.50) by the number of people (10).

Cost for 10 people = 2.50 * 10 = \$25.00

Next, we subtract this cost from the total amount earned by the Girl Scouts (\$30) to find out how much money is left after the pool trip.

Money left = Total amount earned - Cost for 10 people
Money left = 30 - 25 = \$5.00
