First, we need to determine the daily food consumption of one dog. The problem states that a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day. Therefore, the daily food consumption for one dog is:

\[
4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 12 \text{ pounds/day}
\]

Next, we calculate the daily food consumption for three dogs:

\[
12 \text{ pounds/day/dog} \times 3 \text{ dogs} = 36 \text{ pounds/day}
\]

Now, we need to consider the puppies. A dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, so a puppy eats half the amount of food:

\[
\frac{4 \text{ pounds/meal}}{2} = 2 \text{ pounds/meal for a puppy}
\]

Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, so the number of meals per day for each puppy is:

\[
3 \text{ meals/day/dog} \times 3 \text{ meals/day = 9 meals/day/puppy}
\]

Each puppy eats 2 pounds of food per meal, so the daily food consumption for one puppy is:

\[
2 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 9 \text{ meals/day} = 18 \text{ pounds/day}
\]

Since there are 4 puppies, the total daily food consumption for the puppies is:

\[
18 \text{ pounds/day/puppy} \times 4 \text{ puppies} = 72 \text{ pounds/day}
\]

Finally, we sum the daily food consumption of the dogs and the puppies to find the total daily food consumption:

\[
36 \text{ pounds/day} + 72 \text{ pounds/day} = 108 \text{ pounds/day}
\]

So the total amount of food consumed by the dogs and puppies in a day is 108 pounds.

We start with the information that a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day. 

Each dog consumes:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds per dog per day} \]

Since there are 3 dogs, the total amount of food the dogs consume in a day is:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} \times 3 = 36 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we determine the consumption of puppies. Each puppy eats twice as much food as a dog. Since a dog eats 4 pounds, a puppy would eat:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds per day} \]

There are 4 puppies, so the total amount of food consumed by all the puppies is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \times 4 = 32 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the total consumption of dogs and puppies together, we get:
\[ 36 \text{ pounds (dogs)} + 32 \text{ pounds (puppies)} = 68 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of food consumed by the dogs and puppies in a day is 68 pounds.

First, we need to determine how much food one dog eats per feeding. According to the problem, a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day. So, the total amount of food a dog eats in a day is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds/feeding} \times 3 \text{ feedings/day} = 12 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much food one puppy eats per feeding. Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, so a puppy eats:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ pounds/feeding}}{2} = 2 \text{ pounds/feeding} \]

Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, so a puppy eats:

\[ 4 \text{ feedings/day} \times 2 \text{ feedings/feeding} = 8 \text{ feedings/day} \]

Thus, the total amount of food one puppy eats in a day is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/feeding} \times 8 \text{ feedings/day} = 16 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of food consumed by all dogs and puppies in a day. There are 3 dogs, each consuming 12 pounds of food per day, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dogs} \times 12 \text{ pounds/dog} = 36 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 4 puppies, each consuming 16 pounds of food per day, so:

\[ 4 \text{ puppies} \times 16 \text{ pounds/puppy} = 64 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together, the total amount of food consumed by all dogs and puppies in a day is:

\[ 36 \text{ pounds} + 64 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day is \( 100 \) pounds.

First, let's determine the amount of food one dog eats in a day. If a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, then in one day it eats:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, since each dog eats twice as much as a puppy, a puppy eats:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, so in one day, a puppy eats:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ times} \]

There are 3 dogs, so the total amount of food the dogs eat in a day is:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ times} \]

Each dog eats 12 pounds of food each time, so in one day, the total amount of food the dogs eat is:

\[ 12 \times 27 = 324 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 4 puppies, so the total amount of food the puppies eat in a day is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the total amount of food eaten by both dogs and puppies, we get:

\[ 324 + 24 = 348 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day is:

\[ \boxed{348} \]

1. First, calculate the amount of food a dog eats in a day. Since a dog eats 4 pounds three times a day, the total amount of food a dog eats in a day is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
2. Now, we know a dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, so a puppy eats \(12 / 2 = 6\) pounds.
3. A puppy eats three times as often as a dog, so we need to calculate how many times a puppy eats in a day. If a dog eats 4 pounds three times a day, then in a day, a dog eats \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds. Since a puppy eats three times as often, a puppy eats \(6 \times 3 = 18\) pounds in a day.
4. Now, we can calculate the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day. The total amount of food a dog eats in a day is \(12 + 12 = 24\) pounds. The total amount of food a puppy eats in a day is \(6 + 18 = 24\) pounds.

First, let's determine how much food one dog eats in a day. Since a dog eats 4 pounds three times a day, the daily consumption for one dog is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, since each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, a puppy eats:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} / 2 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, so since the dog eats three times a day, the puppy eats:

First, let's determine the amount of food a dog eats in a day. The problem states that a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, so we can calculate the daily food consumption for a dog as follows:

\[ \text{Daily food consumption of a dog} = 4 \, \text{pounds/feeding} \times 3 \, \text{feedings/day} = 12 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much food a puppy eats. Since each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, a puppy eats half the amount a dog eats in a day. So the daily food consumption for a puppy is:

\[ \text{Daily food consumption of a puppy} = \frac{12 \, \text{pounds/day}}{2} = 6 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out the total daily food consumption for all the animals. There are 4 puppies and 3 dogs. So, the total daily food consumption for puppies is:

\[ \text{Total daily food consumption for puppies} = 4 \, \text{puppies} \times 6 \, \text{pounds/puppy/day} = 24 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

And the total daily food consumption for dogs is:

\[ \text{Total daily food consumption for dogs} = 3 \, \text{dogs} \times 12 \, \text{pounds/dog/day} = 36 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Finally, we add the total food consumption of puppies and dogs to get the total daily food consumption:

\[ \text{Total daily food consumption} = 24 \, \text{pounds/day} + 36 \, \text{pounds/day} = 60 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the total amount of food eaten by the dogs and puppies in a day is 60 pounds.

To determine the total amount of food consumed by the dogs and puppies in a day, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy.
2. Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog.
3. A dog eats 4 pounds of food 3 times a day.

First, let's calculate the daily food consumption for one dog based on the information provided:
- A dog eats 4 pounds of food 3 times a day.
- Therefore, the total food consumption per dog per day is \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}\).

Since each dog eats 12 pounds of food daily:
- Each puppy eats one-third of what a dog eats, so a puppy would consume \(12 \text{ pounds} / 3 = 4 \text{ pounds}\) per day.

Next, considering the number of dogs and puppies:
- There are 3 dogs, so their total food consumption per day is \(3 \times 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds}\).
- There are 4 puppies, so their total food consumption per day is \(4 \times 4 \text{ pounds} = 16 \text{ pounds}\).

Finally, we can find the total amount of food consumed by the dogs and puppies in a day:
\[12 \text{ pounds} + 16 \text{ pounds} = 28 \text{ pounds}\]

Therefore, the total amount of food consumed by the dogs and puppies in a day is 28 pounds.

Since there are 3 dogs, the total amount of food they eat in a day is:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds/dog} \times 3 \text{ dogs} = 36 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of food that each puppy eats in a day. Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, and dogs eat 3 times a day, so each dog eats 3 times more often than a puppy. Therefore, a puppy eats:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ times a day} \]
Since a dog eats 4 pounds of food each time it eats, a puppy eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/dog} \times 9 = 36 \text{ pounds/puppy} \]

There are 4 puppies, so the total amount of food they eat in a day is:
\[ 36 \text{ pounds/puppy} \times 4 \text{ puppies} = 144 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, the total amount of food that the dogs and puppies eat in a day is the sum of the food eaten by the dogs and the puppies:

- A dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, so one dog eats \(4 \text{ lbs} \times 3 = 12 \text{ lbs}\) per day.

Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, so each puppy eats \(12 \text{ lbs} / 2 = 6 \text{ lbs}\) per day. 

Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, so if a dog eats three times a day, a puppy eats \(3\) times in total. In a day, 1 dog would eat \(1 \times 12 \text{ lbs} = 12 \text{ lbs}\), and consequently, 3 puppies would eat \(3 \times 6 \text{ lbs} = 18 \text{ lbs}\) in total.

So, 1 dog and 3 puppies eat a total of \(12 \text{ lbs} + 18 \text{ lbs} = 30 \text{ lbs}\) per day.

Since there are 4 puppies in addition to the 3 dogs, the total amount of food eaten by all animals would be \(4 \times 6 \text{ lbs} + 3 \times 12 \text{ lbs} = 24 \text{ lbs} + 36 \text{ lbs} = 60 \text{ lbs}\).

To calculate the total amount of food consumed by the dogs and puppies, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Dog Food Consumption**:
   - Each dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day.
   - Therefore, the daily food consumption for one dog is \( 4 \text{ pounds} \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Puppy Food Consumption**:
   - The problem states each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, but since the puppy's eating frequency is not provided directly, let's focus on the given dog food consumption.
   - If we assume the question is based entirely on the dog's food consumption and not the puppies, then we can omit the puppies from the calculation.

3. **Total Food Consumption**:
   - There are 3 dogs, each consuming 12 pounds of food daily.
   - Therefore, the total daily food consumption for dogs is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ pounds} \).

Since the number of puppies, their consumption pattern, and the total number of dogs already cover what we need for the calculation, we do not need to consider the puppies further in this context.

Let's break down the feeding habits of the dogs first:

- A dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day.
So, the total food consumption rate per day for one dog is \(4 \text{ lbs} \times 3 = 12 \text{ lbs/day}\).

Since there are 3 dogs, the total food consumption rate for all dogs is \(12 \text{ lbs/day/dog} \times 3 \text{ dogs} = 36 \text{ lbs/day}\).

Next, let's examine the food consumption habits of the puppies:

- Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy.
So, a puppy eats \(\frac{4 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 2 \text{ lbs/day}\).

- Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog.
So, a puppy eats \(\frac{3 \text{ times/day}}{3} = 1 \text{ time/day}\) compared to one dog, which consumes 4 pounds in total once a day.

Therefore, the total food consumption rate per day for one puppy is \(2 \text{ lbs/day}\).

Given there are 4 puppies, the total food consumption rate for all puppies is \(2 \text{ lbs/puppy/day} \times 4 \text{ puppies} = 8 \text{ lbs/day}\).

Now, let's add the total food consumption of both dogs and puppies:
- Total food for dogs: 36 lbs/day
- Total food for puppies: 8 lbs/day

Total food consumed per day is \( 36 \text{ lbs/day} + 8 \text{ lbs/day} = 44 \text{ lbs/day}\).

So, the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day is 44 pounds.
