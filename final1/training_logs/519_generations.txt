We can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. There are 25 layers of rock.
2. Out of these, 5 are limestone.
3. So, there are 25 - 5 = 20 layers left.
4. Half of the remaining layers are sandstone. So, 20 / 2 = 10 are sandstone.
5. Four of the remaining layers are quartz. So, there are 20 - 10 - 4 = 6 layers left.
6. Half of the remaining layers are shale. So, 6 / 2 = 3 are shale.
7. The rest of the layers are different kinds of rock. So, 6 - 3 = 3 are different kinds of rock.

Therefore, the number of kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata is 3.

To determine the number of kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 25 layers of rock in total.
2. Five of these layers are limestone.
3. Half of the remaining layers are sandstone.

First, let's find out how many layers are left after accounting for the limestone:

\[25 - 5 = 20 \text{ layers}\]

Next, half of these layers are sandstone:

\[\frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ layers of sandstone}\]

Now, let's find out how many layers are left after accounting for the sandstone:

\[20 - 10 = 10 \text{ layers}\]

Four of these remaining layers are quartz:

\[2 \text{ layers of quartz}\]

Now, let's find out how many layers are left after accounting for the quartz:

\[10 - 4 = 6 \text{ layers}\]

Half of the remaining layers are shale:

\[\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ layers of shale}\]

The rest of the layers are all different kinds of rock, which we have already accounted for as 6 layers in total. This accounts for the limestone, sandstone, quartz, and shale layers.

Therefore, the number of kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata is 6.

To determine the number of kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata, we need to first find out how many layers are left after accounting for the specific types of rocks mentioned.

1. There are 25 layers of rock in total.
2. Five of these layers are limestone.
   - Remaining layers after limestone: \(25 - 5 = 20\)
3. Half of the remaining layers are sandstone.
   - Sandstone layers: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10\)
   - Remaining layers after sandstone: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
4. Four of the remaining layers are quartz.
   - Remaining layers after quartz: \(10 - 4 = 6\)
5. Half of the remaining layers are shale.
   - Shale layers: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3\)
   - Remaining layers after shale: \(6 - 3 = 3\)
6. The rest are all different kinds of rock, which make up 3 layers.
   - Remaining kinds of rock: 3

So, the number of kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata is 3.

Reasoning:
First, we know that there are 25 layers of rock in total. Five of these are limestone, and half of the rest (20 layers) are sandstone. This gives us:

1. Limestone: 5 layers
2. Sandstone: \( \frac{1}{2} \times (25 - 5 - 20) = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 = 2.5 \) layers (not possible, so we use 2 layers)
3. Remaining: 20 - 5 - 2 = 13 layers
4. Four of the remaining are quartz, leaving:
   - Remaining: 13 - 2 = 11 layers
5. Half of the rest are shale, so:
   - Shale: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 11 = 5.5 \) layers (again, not possible, so we use 5 layers)
6. The rest are different kinds of rock, totaling 11 - 2 = 9 kinds of rock.

Answer:
The number of kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon’s strata is 9.

Let's break down the strata layers by type:

1. Total layers of rock: 25
2. Limestone layers: 5
3. Remaining layers: 25 - 5 = 20 layers

Half of these remaining layers are sandstone:

1. Sandstone layers: 1/2 * 20 = 10
4. Remaining layers: 20 - 10 = 10 layers

Four of the remaining layers are quartz:

1. Quartz layers: 10 - 4 = 6
5. Remaining layers: 10 - 4 = 6 layers

Half of these remaining layers are shale:

1. Shale layers: 1/2 * 6 = 3
6. Remaining layers (of only different kinds of rock): 6 - 3 = 3

So, 3 kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon's strata.

The total number of layers excluding the limestone is 25 - 5 = 20. Half of these are sandstone, meaning there are 20 / 2 = 10 layers of sandstone.

The remaining 10 layers are quartz. Four of these, along with the 5 layers of limestone, account for 4 + 5 = 9 layers. This leaves 10 - 9 = 1 layer of quartz.

The remaining layers are all different kinds of rock, so there is 1 layer that is different from the rest.

The rest of the layers (excluding the 1 layer of different kinds of rock) are the ones that are all different kinds of rock.

Therefore, 1 layer of different kinds of rock makes up only one layer in the canyon’s strata.

To determine how many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon's strata, we will follow these steps:

1. **Total number of layers**: 25.
2. **Limestone layers**: 5 (which is half of the total).

So, the number of layers outside limestone is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

3. **Sandstone layers**: Half of the remaining layers are sandstone.
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
So, there are 10 sandstone layers.

4. **Quartz layers**: 4 out of the remaining 10 layers are quartz.
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]
So, there are 6 quartz layers.

5. **Shale layers**: Half of the remaining 6 layers are shale.
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
So, there are 3 shale layers.

6. **Remaining layers**: The rest of the layers consist of all different kinds of rock.
\[ 25 - (5 + 10 + 6 + 3) = 25 - 24 = 1 \]
Therefore, there is 1 kind of rock that makes up only one layer in the canyon's strata.

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's determine the number of non-limestone layers. There are 25 layers total, and 5 are limestone, so there are \(25 - 5 = 20\) non-limestone layers.

2. Half of the remaining layers are sandstone. There are 20 non-limestone layers, so half of them is \(20 / 2 = 10\) layers of sandstone.

3. Four of the remaining are quartz, leaving us with \(10 - 4 = 6\) layers that are either shale or different kinds of rock.

4. Half of the rest are shale. So, \(6 / 2 = 3\) layers are shale.

5. The rest are all different kinds of rock, so there are \(6 - 3 = 3\) different kinds of rock that make up only one layer.

Therefore, there are 3 different kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata.

3. Remaining layers after limestone: 25 - 5 = 20

Half of the remaining layers are sandstone:

To determine how many kinds of rock make up only one layer, we start by summarizing the given information:

1. Total layers = 25
2. Layers of limestone = 5
3. Half of the remaining layers are sandstone: (1/2)(total - layers of limestone) = (1/2)(25 - 5) = (1/2) * 20 = 10 sandstone layers
4. Layers of quartz = 4
5. The rest are all different kinds of rock.

First, we calculate the remaining layers after accounting for limestone, sandstone, and quartz:
\[ \text{Remaining layers} = \text{Total layers} - \text{layers of limestone} - \text{layers of sandstone} - \text{layers of quartz} \]
\[ \text{Remaining layers} = 25 - 5 - 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, half of these remaining layers are shale:
\[ \text{Shale layers} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Remaining layers} \]
\[ \text{Shale layers} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]
This leaves the other half:
\[ \text{Other rock layers} = \text{Remaining layers} - \text{Shale layers} \]
\[ \text{Other rock layers} = 6 - 3 = 3 \]

To find how many kinds of rock make up only one layer, we sum these remaining layers:
\[ \text{Different kinds of rock in one layer} = \text{Remaining layers of different rock} \]
\[ \text{Different kinds of rock in one layer} = 3 \]

So, there are 3 different kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon’s strata.

To determine how many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon's strata, we start by breaking down the information given.

1. Total layers of rock = 25
2. Number of limestone layers = 5
3. Number of sandstone layers (half of the remaining layers) = 25 - 5 - x = 25 - 5 - 12.5, but since the number of layers must be an integer, we use 25 - 5 - 12 = 8
4. Number of quartz layers (4 of the remaining layers) = x = 8 - 4 = 4
5. Number of shale layers (half of the remaining layers) = x - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0

Next, we need to find the number of layers that are not described by the limestone, sandstone, quartz, or shale. These layers make up only one type.

Total layers of rock = 25
Number of layers of limestone = 5
Number of layers of sandstone = 8
Number of layers of quartz = 4
Number of layers of shale = 0

Kinds of rock that make up only one layer:
Total layers - (layers of limestone + layers of sandstone + layers of quartz)
= 25 - (5 + 8 + 4)
= 25 - 17
= 8

Therefore, the number of kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon’s strata is 8.
