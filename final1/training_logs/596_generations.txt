###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

John is holding a poker night with his friends and is getting the decks of cards ready before his friends show up. After losing so many cards from various decks, John thinks he needs to count exactly how many cards he has to make sure he has enough full decks for the night. Each deck of cards should hold 52 cards. He finds 3 half-full decks of cards and 3 full decks of cards. As he is arranging them, he realizes that the quality of a lot of the cards is quite poor and decides to throw 34 of the cards in the trash. How many cards does John now have?

system
<reasoning>
First, we need to determine the total number of cards in the 3 half-full decks. Since each full deck holds 52 cards, a half-full deck holds 26 cards. Therefore, 3 half-full decks will contain:
\[ 3 \times 26 = 78 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we add the number of cards in the 3 full decks:
\[ 3 \times 52 = 156 \text{ cards} \]

Combining these results, the total number of cards before discarding any is:
\[ 78 + 156 = 234 \text{ cards} \]

John discards 34 cards, so we subtract these from the total:
\[ 234 - 34 = 200 \text{ cards} \]

John has 3 half-full decks of cards, meaning he has \(3 \times 26 = 78\) cards from these decks.
He also has 3 full decks of cards, so he has \(3 \times 52 = 156\) cards from these.
In total, John has \(78 + 156 = 234\) cards.

However, he throws away 34 cards, so the number of cards John has now is \(234 - 34 = 200\).

To find out how many cards John has after throwing away the poor-quality ones, we need to first determine the total number of cards he starts with and then subtract the ones he throws away.

1. Each full deck of cards holds 52 cards. John has 3 full decks:
   \( 3 \times 52 = 156 \) cards

2. Each half-full deck of cards also holds 52 cards. John has 3 half-full decks:
   \( 3 \times 26 = 78 \) cards (since half of 52 is 26)

3. Before throwing away the poor-quality cards, John has:
   \( 156 + 78 = 234 \) cards

4. John throws away 34 poor-quality cards:
   \( 234 - 34 = 200 \) cards

So, John now has 200 cards.

John initially has 52 cards in a full deck and 52 cards in a half-full deck. Therefore, for each half-full deck, he has 26 cards. There are three half-full decks, so he has \(3 \times 26 = 78\) cards from the half-full decks. He also has 52 cards from the full decks. So, in total, he has \(78 + 52 = 130\) cards initially. After throwing 34 cards in the trash, he is left with \(130 - 34 = 96\) cards.

To determine the total number of cards John has left, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the number of cards in the 3 half-full decks:
   Each half-full deck has 26 cards (since a full deck has 52 cards, half of 52 is 26).
   So, for 3 half-full decks, the total is:
   \[
   3 \times 26 = 78 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. Next, add the number of cards in the 3 full decks:
   Each full deck has 52 cards.
   So, for 3 full decks, the total is:
   \[
   3 \times 52 = 156 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. Now, add the cards from both types of decks to get the total number of cards John initially has:
   \[
   78 + 156 = 234 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. After throwing away 34 cards, subtract this from the initial total:
   \[
   234 - 34 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

So, John now has 200 cards.

To find out how many cards John has left, we need to calculate the number of cards in the half-full decks, full decks, and then subtract the 34 cards he threw away.

1. Calculate the number of cards in the half-full decks:
   - Each deck consists of 52 cards, and a half-full deck means it has cards for 26 out of the 52.
   - John has 3 half-full decks, so the total number of cards in these is \(3 \times 26 = 78\).

2. Calculate the number of cards in the full decks:
   - Each deck has 52 cards.
   - John has 3 full decks, so the total number of cards in these is \(3 \times 52 = 156\).

3. Add the number of cards in the half-full decks and the full decks:
   - \(78 + 156 = 234\)

4. Subtract the number of cards he threw away:
   - John threw away 34 cards, so the final number of cards he has is \(234 - 34 = 200\).

So, after all the calculations, John has 200 cards remaining.

John finds a total of 3 half-full decks from which each deck would contain 26 cards (since a full deck has 52 cards, a half-full deck would have half of that number). Since he finds 3 full decks, and each of those would contain 52 cards, we can calculate the total number of cards as follows:

3 half-full decks * 26 cards per deck = 78 cards
3 full decks * 52 cards per deck = 156 cards

Adding these together gives us the total number of cards he initially has:
78 cards + 156 cards = 234 cards

John then throws 34 cards in the trash, so we subtract these from the total:
234 cards - 34 cards = 200 cards

Therefore, John now has 200 cards.

To find out how many cards John has left, we need to first calculate the total number of cards he starts with and then subtract the number of cards he throws away.

The initial count of cards is calculated as follows:
- Each full deck has 52 cards. So, 3 full decks contribute \(3 \times 52 = 156\) cards.
- Each half-full deck has 26 cards. So, 3 half-full decks contribute \(3 \times 26 = 78\) cards.

Adding these together gives the total number of cards before throwing any away:
\[156 + 78 = 234\]

Next, John throws away 34 cards. So, the final count of cards John has is:
\[234 - 34 = 200\]

Therefore, John now has 200 cards.

Total number of cards from half-full decks = 3 decks * 26 cards per deck = 78 cards. 

Total number of cards from full decks = 3 decks * 52 cards per deck = 156 cards.

Total number of good cards = Total number of cards from half-full decks + Total number of cards from full decks - 34 cards in trash = 78 cards + 156 cards - 34 cards = 200 cards.

John now has 200 good cards from the decks.

First, we calculate the number of cards in the half-full decks. Since each deck should hold 52 cards, half a deck would have \(52 / 2 = 26\) cards. John has 3 half-full decks, so the number of cards from these decks is \(3 \times 26 = 78\) cards.

Next, we consider the full decks. John has 3 full decks, each holding 52 cards. So, the number of cards from the full decks is \(3 \times 52 = 156\) cards.

Adding the cards from both types of decks, we get \(78 + 156 = 234\) cards.

Finally, John throws 34 cards in the trash. Therefore, the total number of cards he has now is \(234 - 34 = 200\) cards.

First, we determine the total number of cards John initially has:

- \(3 \times 52 = 156\) cards from the half-full decks (since each full deck has 52 cards and 52/2 = 26 cards per half-full deck).
- \(3 \times 52 = 156\) cards from the full decks.
- \(156 + 156 = 312\) cards.

Next, John discards 34 of these cards:

- \(312 - 34 = 278\) cards.
