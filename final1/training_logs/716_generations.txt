Let's calculate the total cost Mr. Callen incurs for the items:

- Cost of paintings: \( 10 \times 40 = \$400 \)
- Cost of wooden toys: \( 8 \times 20 = \$160 \)
- Total cost: \( 400 + 160 = \$560 \)

Next, let's determine the selling price of each item after the reductions:

- Selling price of painting: \( 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = \$36 \)
- Selling price of wooden toy: \( 20 \times (1 - 0.15) = \$17 \)

Now, calculate the total selling value:

- Total selling value of paintings: \( 10 \times 36 = \$360 \)
- Total selling value of wooden toys: \( 8 \times 17 = \$136 \)
- Total selling value: \( 360 + 136 = \$496 \)

Finally, calculate the total loss:

- Total loss: \( 560 - 496 = \$64 \)

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue Mr. Callen incurred.

For the paintings:
- Number of paintings = 10
- Cost per painting = $40
- Total cost for paintings = 10 * $40 = $400

For the wooden toys:
- Number of wooden toys = 8
- Cost per wooden toy = $20
- Total cost for wooden toys = 8 * $20 = $160

Total cost = Cost for paintings + Cost for wooden toys
Total cost = $400 + $160 = $560

Now, let's calculate the selling price for each item. The selling price of a painting is 10% less than the cost price, so:
- Selling price per painting = Cost per painting - (10% of Cost per painting)
- Selling price per painting = $40 - (0.10 * $40) = $40 - $4 = $36
- Total selling price for paintings = 10 * $36 = $360

The selling price of a wooden toy is 15% less than the cost price, so:
- Selling price per wooden toy = Cost per wooden toy - (15% of Cost per wooden toy)
- Selling price per wooden toy = $20 - (0.15 * $20) = $20 - $3 = $17
- Total selling price for wooden toys = 8 * $17 = $136

Total selling price = Total selling price for paintings + Total selling price for wooden toys
Total selling price = $360 + $136 = $496

The total loss is the difference between the total cost and the total selling price:
- Total loss = Total cost - Total selling price
- Total loss = $560 - $496 = $64

Therefore, Mr. Callen made a total loss of $64 from the sale of the items.

To calculate the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost price of the paintings and wooden toys.
2. Calculate the total selling price of the paintings and wooden toys.
3. Find the difference between the total cost price and the total selling price to determine the total loss.

Let's start with step 1. The cost price of the paintings is:
\[ 10 \text{ paintings} \times \$40/\text{painting} = \$400 \]

The cost price of the wooden toys is:
\[ 8 \text{ wooden toys} \times \$20/\text{wood toy} = \$160 \]

So, the total cost price is:
\[ \$400 + \$160 = \$560 \]

Next, let's move to step 2. The selling price of each painting is 10% less than the cost price, so:
\[ \text{Selling price of each painting} = \$40 \times (1 - 0.10) = \$40 \times 0.90 = \$36 \]

So, the total selling price of the paintings is:
\[ 10 \text{ paintings} \times \$36/\text{painting} = \$360 \]

Similarly, the selling price of each wooden toy is 15% less than the cost price, so:
\[ \text{Selling price of each wooden toy} = \$20 \times (1 - 0.15) = \$20 \times 0.85 = \$17 \]

So, the total selling price of the wooden toys is:
\[ 8 \text{ wooden toys} \times \$17/\text{wood toy} = \$136 \]

Finally, the total selling price of all items is:
\[ \$360 + \$136 = \$496 \]

Now, we can find the total loss as the difference between the total cost price and the total selling price:
\[ \$560 - \$496 = \$64 \]

So, Mr. Callen made a total loss of \$64.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the paintings and wooden toys that Mr. Callen bought. He bought 10 paintings at $40 each and 8 wooden toys at $20 each. The total cost can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 \times 40 + 8 \times 20 = 400 + 160 = 560
\]
Next, let's calculate the selling price of one painting and one wooden toy. The selling price of a painting was 10% less than the original price, so:
\[
\text{Selling price of a painting} = 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36
\]
Similarly, the selling price of a wooden toy was 15% less than the original price, so:
\[
\text{Selling price of a wooden toy} = 20 \times (1 - 0.15) = 20 \times 0.85 = 17
\]
Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the paintings and wooden toys:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 10 \times 36 + 8 \times 17 = 360 + 136 = 496

Cost of paintings = 10 paintings * $40/painting = $400
Cost of wooden toys = 8 wooden toys * $20/wooden toy = $160

Total cost = $400 + $160 = $560

Next, let's calculate the total selling price for both paintings and wooden toys after the profit markup.

Selling price of paintings = $40 * 10% = $40 * 0.1 = $4
Total selling price of paintings = $4 * 10 = $40

Selling price of wooden toys = $20 * 15% = $20 * 0.15 = $3
Total selling price of wooden toys = $3 * 8 = $24

Total selling price = $40 + $24 = $64

The total loss is calculated by subtracting the total selling price from the total cost.

To calculate the total loss, we first need to determine the total cost price and the total selling price of all the items.

First, let's calculate the total cost price for the paintings:
- Each painting costs $40.
- Mr. Callen bought 10 paintings.
- Total cost price for paintings = \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \).

Next, let's calculate the total cost price for the wooden toys:
- Each wooden toy costs $20.
- Mr. Callen bought 8 wooden toys.
- Total cost price for wooden toys = \( 8 \times 20 = 160 \).

The total cost price for all items is:
\[ 400 + 160 = 560 \]

Now, let's calculate the selling price of each item:
- The selling price of a painting is 10% less than its cost.
  - Selling price of a painting = \( 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \).
- The selling price of a wooden toy is 15% less than its cost.
  - Selling price of a wooden toy = \( 20 \times (1 - 0.15) = 20 \times 0.85 = 17 \).

Next, let's calculate the total selling price for the paintings and the wooden toys:
- Total selling price for paintings = \( 10 \times 36 = 360 \).
- Total selling price for wooden toys = \( 8 \times 17 = 136 \).

The total selling price for all items is:
\[ 360 + 136 = 496 \]

The profit Mr. Callen initially made is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price:
\[ 496 - 560 = -64 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates a loss. The total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items is:
\[ 64 \]

First, calculate the total cost of the paintings and toys Mr. Callen bought. He bought 10 paintings at $40 each, so the total cost for paintings is \(10 \times 40 = \$400\). Similarly, for the 8 wooden toys at $20 each, the total cost is \(8 \times 20 = \$160\). Therefore, the total cost for all items is \(400 + 160 = \$560\).

Next, determine the selling prices. The selling price of a painting is 10% less than the buying price, which means each painting was sold for \(40 \times (1 - 0.10) = \$36. The selling price of a hat is 15% less than the buying price, meaning each hat was sold for \(20 \times (1 - 0.15) = \$17\).

To find the total revenue from selling all items, calculate the revenue from the paintings and toys separately:
- The revenue from paintings: \(10 \times 36 = \$360\)
- The revenue from wooden toys: \(8 \times 17 = \$136\)

Thus, the total revenue from selling all items is \(360 + 136 = \$496\).

Finally, the total loss Mr. Callen made is the total cost minus the total revenue, which is \(560 - 496 = \$64\).

First, let's calculate the total cost of the paintings and toys that Mr. Callen bought.

Cost of paintings = 10 * $40 = $400
Cost of toys = 8 * $20 = $160

Total cost = $400 + $160 = $560

Now, let's calculate the selling prices of the items with the given discounts.

Selling price of a painting = $40 - 10% of $40 = $40 - $4 = $36
Selling price of a toy = $20 - 15% of $20 = $20 - $3 = $17

Number of paintings sold = 10
Number of toys sold = 8

Selling price of 10 paintings = 10 * $36 = $360
Selling price of 8 toys = 8 * $17 = $136

Total selling price = $360 + $136 = $496

Now, let's calculate the total loss. 

Total loss = Total cost - Total selling price = $560 - $496 = $64

However, there is another error here as we are assuming all the items were resold, but they were actually bought for $400 for paintings and $160 for toys. The total cost is only $560 as calculated before. Now we need to recalculate total selling price with the correct amounts.

Selling price of 10 paintings = 10 * $32 (since 10% discount on $40 would be $4, hence $36 would be $36 - $4 = $32)
Selling price of 8 toys = 8 * $15 (since 15% discount on $20 would be $3, hence $17 would be $17 - $3 = $14)

Total selling price = $320 + $112 = $432

Now, let's recalculate the total loss.

Total loss = Total cost - Total selling price = $560 - $432 = $128

Therefore, the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items is $128.

To calculate the total loss Mr. Callen made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the paintings and toys.
2. Calculate the selling price for each item.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the items.
4. Subtract the total revenue from the total cost to find the loss.

First, the total cost for the paintings and toys:
- Cost of 10 paintings: 10 * $40 = $400
- Cost of 8 wooden toys: 8 * $20 = $160

Total cost: $400 + $160 = $560

Next, we need to calculate the selling prices for each item:
- Selling price of a painting: 10% less than $40 = 90% of $40 = $36
- Selling price of a wooden toy: 15% less than $20 = 85% of $20 = $17

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:
- Revenue from paintings: 10 * $36 = $360
- Revenue from wooden toys: 8 * $17 = $136

Total revenue: $360 + $136 = $496

Finally, we calculate the total loss:

1. Calculate the total cost for the paintings and wooden toys.
2. Calculate the total selling price for the paintings and wooden toys after the given discounts.
3. Subtract the total selling price from the total cost to get the total loss.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost

Cost of paintings:
10 paintings * $40 each = $400

Cost of wooden toys:
8 wooden toys * $20 each = $160

Total cost = $400 + $160 = $560

Step 2: Calculate the total selling price

Selling price of a painting:
$40 - 10% of $40 = $40 - $4 = $36

Total selling price of paintings = 10 * $36 = $360

Selling price of a hat:
$20 - 15% of $20 = $20 - $3 = $17

Total selling price of wooden toys = 8 * $17 = $136

Total selling price = $360 + $136 = $496

Step 3: Calculate the total loss

Total loss = Total cost - Total selling price = $560 - $496 = $64

- Cost for wooden toys: \(8 \times \$20 = \$160\)

So, the total cost of all items is:
\[
\$400 + \$160 = \$560
\]

Next, let's calculate the selling price and the loss for each item.

For the paintings:
- Selling price per painting: \(40 \times 0.90 = \$36\) (10% less)

For the wooden toys:
- Selling price per toy: \(20 \times 0.85 = \$17\) (15% less)

Now, we need to find the total selling price of all items:
- Total selling price for 10 paintings: \(10 \times \$36 = \$360\)
- Total selling price for 8 toys: \(8 \times \$17 = \$136\)

So, the total selling price of all items is:
\[
\$360 + \$136 = \$496

The cost of the paintings is \(10 \text{ paintings} \times \$40/\text{painting} = \$400\).
The cost of the wooden toys is \(8 \text{ wooden toys} \times \$20/\text{wooden toy} = \$160\).
The total cost is \(\$400 + \$160 = \$560\).

Next, we determine the selling price for each item. The selling price of a painting is \(10\% \text{ less} = 0.9 \times \$40 = \$36\) per painting.
The selling price of a wooden toy is \(15\% \text{ less} = 0.85 \times \$20 = \$17\) per wooden toy.

Therefore, for 10 paintings, the total revenue is \(10 \text{ paintings} \times \$36/\text{painting} = \$360\).
For 8 wooden toys, the total revenue is \(8 \text{ wooden toys} \times \$17/\text{wooden toy} = \$136\).

The total revenue is \(\$360 + \$136 = \$496\).

The total loss made by Mr. Callen is the difference between the total cost and the total revenue. Thus, the loss is \(\$560 - \$496 = \$64\).
