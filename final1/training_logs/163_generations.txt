system
James scores 4 touchdowns per game, with each touchdown being worth 6 points. So for touchdowns alone, that makes:
4 touchdowns/game * 6 points/touchdown = 24 points/game

Since there are 15 games in the season, that makes:
24 points/game * 15 games = 360 points

He also scores 2 point conversions 6 times, which add:
2 points/conversion * 6 conversions = 12 points

So in total, he scores:
360 points + 12 points = 372 points

The old record was 300 points, so he beat it by:
372 points - 300 points = 72 points
