Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. Mike ate 20 chocolate squares.
2. According to Mike, Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that he ate.
3. To find out how many chocolate squares Jenny ate, we need to calculate thrice the number of chocolate squares Mike ate and then add 5 to it.

The calculation for thrice the number of chocolate squares Mike ate is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Adding the 5 extra chocolate squares that Jenny ate, we get:
\[ 60 + 5 = 65 \]

So, Jenny ate 65 chocolate squares.

Therefore, the number of chocolate squares Jenny ate is 65.

Let's denote the number of chocolate squares Mike ate as \( M \). So, \( M = 20 \).

According to the problem, Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate. Let's denote the number of chocolate squares Jenny ate as \( J \). So, we can write:

\[ J = 3M + 5 \]

Substituting \( M = 20 \):

\[ J = 3 \times 20 + 5 \]
\[ J = 60 + 5 \]
\[ J = 65 \]

Therefore, Jenny ate 65 chocolate squares.

<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of chocolate squares Mike ate as \( M \) and the number of chocolate squares Jenny ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Mike ate 20 chocolate squares, so \( M = 20 \). The problem states that Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate. We can express this as an equation:

\[ J = 3M + 5 \]

Substituting the value of \( M \) (which is 20) into the equation:

\[ J = 3 \times 20 + 5 \]

We then perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ J = 60 + 5 \]
\[ J = 65 \]

So, Jenny ate 65 chocolate squares.

To determine how many chocolate squares Jenny ate, we can set up an equation based on the information given. 

First, we know that Mike ate 20 chocolate squares. According to the problem, Jenny ate 5 more than three times the number of chocolate squares Mike ate. 

The number of chocolate squares Jenny ate can be calculated as follows:
1. Calculate three times the number of chocolate squares Mike ate: \(3 \times 20 = 60\).
2. Add 5 to this result to find out how many chocolate squares Jenny ate: \(60 + 5 = 65\).

So, Jenny ate 65 chocolate squares.

Let's denote the number of chocolate squares Mike ate as \( M \) and the number of chocolate squares Jenny ate as \( J \).

According to the information, Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate:
\[ J = 3M + 5 \]

Given that Mike ate 20 chocolate squares:
\[ M = 20 \]

Substitute this value into the equation for \( J \):
\[ J = 3(20) + 5 \]
\[ J = 60 + 5 \]
\[ J = 65 \]

Therefore, Jenny ate 65 chocolate squares.

According to the problem, Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 3M + 5 \]

We are given that Mike ate 20 chocolate squares, so \( M = 20 \).

Substitute \( M = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ J = 3 \times 20 + 5 \]

<reasoning>
Let's start by translating the given information into a mathematical equation. According to Mike, the number of chocolate squares he ate is 20. Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate. We can represent this as follows: \( \text{Jenny's chocolate squares} = 3 \times \text{Mike's chocolate squares} + 5 \).

Substituting Mike's number of chocolate squares (20) into the equation, we get:
\[ \text{Jenny's chocolate squares} = 3 \times 20 + 5 \]

Now, let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Jenny's chocolate squares} = 60 + 5 = 65 \]

So, Jenny ate 65 chocolate squares.

However, this answer doesn't check with the given choice which is 65. But we can double check the context to make sure no mix-ups or misinterpretations occurred.

Now, let's verify it with Mike's chocolate squares directly by calculating it step-by-step with the information given:
\[ \text{Jenny's chocolate squares} = 3 \times 20 + 5 = 60 + 5 = 65 \]

Since 65 matches the calculation, we can be sure that Jenny ate 65 chocolate squares.

To determine how many chocolate squares Jenny ate, we start by understanding the relationship given in the problem. According to Mike, Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that he ate. Initially, Mike ate 20 chocolate squares.

First, we calculate "thrice the number of chocolate squares that he ate":
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many chocolate squares Jenny ate:
\[ 60 + 5 = 65 \]
