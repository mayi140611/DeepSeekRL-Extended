#### GENERATION 1 RESPONSE ####

system
Chelsea has 24 kilos of sugar and she divides them into 4 bags equally, so each bag contains 24 / 4 = 6 kilos of sugar.

One bag gets torn, and half of the sugar falls to the ground, so the remaining sugar is 6 * (1 - 0.5) = 3 kilos in the torn bag.

The remaining sugar from the 4 bags is 4 * (6 - 3) = 12 kilos.

Therefore, the answer is 12 kilos.

Chelsea has 24 kilos of sugar and divides it into 4 bags equally, so each bag contains 24 / 4 = 6 kilos of sugar.

One of the bags gets torn, and half of the sugar falls to the ground, so 6 / 2 = 3 kilos of sugar remain in the torn bag.

The other three bags still contain 6 kilos each, so 3 + 6 * 3 = 3 + 18 = 21 kilos of sugar remain in total.

system
Chelsea divides the 24 kilos of sugar into 4 equal bags, so each bag contains:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ kilos}}{4} = 6 \text{ kilos per bag} \]

One of the bags gets torn, and half of the sugar from that bag falls to the ground. The amount of sugar in the torn bag is:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ kilos}}{2} = 3 \text{ kilos} \]

So the remaining sugar is the total amount minus the amount lost:

\[ 24 \text{ kilos} - 3 \text{ kilos} = 21 \text{ kilos} \]

Chelsea divides the 24 kilos of sugar into 4 bags equally, so each bag has 24 / 4 = 6 kilos of sugar.

One bag gets torn and half of the sugar in that bag falls to the ground, so half of 6 kilos is 6 / 2 = 3 kilos.

The remaining sugar in the torn bag is 3 kilos.

The total amount of sugar left is 3 kilos (from the torn bag) + 6 kilos (from the other three bags) = 9 kilos.

Chelsea divides 24 kilos of sugar into 4 bags equally, so each bag contains \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) kilos of sugar. 

One of the bags, containing 6 kilos of sugar, gets torn, meaning that \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) kilos of sugar falls to the ground.

The remaining amount of sugar is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) kilos.

Chelsea initially divides 24 kilos of sugar into 4 bags equally, so each bag contains 24 / 4 = 6 kilos of sugar.

One of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground, so half of 6 kilos, which is 6 / 2 = 3 kilos, falls to the ground.

The remaining amount of sugar after losing half from one bag is 6 - 3 = 3 kilos.

Chelsea starts with 24 kilos of sugar and divides them into 4 bags equally, so each bag contains \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) kilos of sugar. 

If one of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground, the amount of sugar that falls is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) kilos.

Therefore, the remaining quantity of sugar is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) kilos.

Chelsea divides the 24 kilos of sugar into 4 bags equally. Each bag contains 24/4 = 6 kilos of sugar.

One of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground. So half of 6 kilos is 6/2 = 3 kilos.

Therefore, 3 kilos of sugar remain.

system
Chelsea divides the 24 kilos of sugar into 4 bags equally, so each bag contains:
\[ 24 \text{ kg} \div 4 = 6 \text{ kg each} \]

If one of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground, then half of the 6 kg in that bag is lost:
\[ 6 \text{ kg} \div 2 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

So, this bag now contains only:
\[ 6 \text{ kg} - 3 \text{ kg} = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Since the remaining part of the other three bags each still contain 6 kg of sugar, the total amount of sugar remaining is:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg} \]

Chelsea divides the 24 kilos of sugar into 4 bags equally, so each bag initially contains \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) kilos of sugar.

Then one of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground, which means half of 6 kilos falls to the ground. So, \( 6 \times \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) kilos of sugar fall to the ground.

Therefore, the remaining sugar is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) kilos.

Chelsea divides 24 kilos of sugar into 4 bags equally, so each bag contains 24 / 4 = 6 kilos of sugar.

One of the bags gets torn, so half of the sugar in that bag falls to the ground. Half of 6 kilos is 6 / 2 = 3 kilos.

The remaining amount of sugar is 6 kilos - 3 kilos = 3 kilos.

Chelsea starts with 24 kilos of sugar and divides them into 4 equal bags, so each bag contains:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ kilos}}{4} = 6 \text{ kilos per bag} \]

If one of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground, the amount of sugar that falls is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ kilos}}{2} = 3 \text{ kilos} \]

Therefore, the amount of sugar remaining can be calculated by subtracting the fallen sugar from the total:
\[ 24 \text{ kilos} - 3 \text{ kilos} = 21 \text{ kilos} \]

Hence, the answer is 21 kilos of sugar remain.

Chelsea divides the 24 kilos of sugar into 4 equal bags, so each bag contains:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ kilos}}{4 \text{ bags}} = 6 \text{ kilos per bag} \]

One of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar from this bag falls to the ground. The original amount in the torn bag is 6 kilos, so the amount that falls to the ground is:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ kilos}}{2} = 3 \text{ kilos} \]

This leaves:

\[ 6 \text{ kilos} - 3 \text{ kilos} = 3 \text{ kilos} \]

The remaining sugar is in three bags, so the total amount remains 3 kilos.

Chelsea divides the 24 kilos of sugar equally into 4 bags, so each bag contains 24/4 = 6 kilos of sugar.

Then one of the bags gets torn, causing half of the sugar in that bag to fall to the ground. Since each bag contains 6 kilos, half of that is 6/2 = 3 kilos.

So, from the bag that got torn, 3 kilos of sugar fall to the ground.

The remaining sugar from all the bags is 4 bags * 6 kilos/bag = 24 kilos.

Therefore, after the incident, 24 - 3 = 21 kilos of sugar remain.
